`` Michael , you 've got to calm down . '' Leonardo whispered , `` Have you *seen* this ? ''  Michael looked up from the script , his eyes wide with disbelief . His eyes scanned Simon , Simon as well .  `` They said it was the man on the screen. ``  Leonardo sighed .  `` I do n't understand . '' He stammered , `` I never thought your friends would have made it that far . ''  Michael sighed and reached out to shake Leo 's hand . `` I know you do , Leo . ''  Leonardo swallowed and set the script down . He grabbed the script and rushed over to Simon .  `` Michael - do you know what could have saved you ? ''  Simon looked at him .  `` ... No . I think it could have saved my life too . ''  `` It could have saved my boyfriend ? ''  Leo looked at Michael .  `` Fuck it . ''  Michael looked back at Michael .  `` Michael , '' Michael whispered , `` Just relax , okay ? ''  Michael closed his eyes and exhaled deeply , `` I need you to *tell* me about the man on the screen . ''  He jumped at the idea of it . The scenes just gave him a chance to think of where these characters were going . Where he felt like he belonged .  `` I know a lot about you , Michael . '' He said , calmly .  Michael looked at him again and answered honestly .  `` If it is that bad , then why the fuck would you be able to tell me about the man on thescreen ? ''  Michael nodded slowly .  Michael looked at him again and smiled .
That night he stumbled down the stairs , his head buried in his hands . At first he thought it was a ghost or something ; everything else was blurry and dark . Then , he was struck with a thought :   *That 's the other thing that keeps me sane , is n't it ? *   When he realised that he could n't leave the basement , his eyes widened . He looked around to see if anyone else lived in there . There were no people around him , nothing but darkness . He 'd seen the bodies everywhere , so he went up to the attic door and knocked .   *I wonder where I am ? *   Nothingness .   He walked over to the wall , expecting some light , but he could n't see anyone underneath . He shook his head . Maybe there was someone there . He pulled the latch , slowly opening the door .   On the other side of the door stood a man . He had an odd way of looking , but he did n't seem to notice it .   *Do n't mind me , man ; I 'm just the guy who sees what 's going on down there . *   The strange man grabbed at the man 's coat . He pulled the blood from the man 's mouth and sucked it in . It was disgusting . He began screaming again . It seemed like he was trying to scream into the air .   *What 's wrong ? *   The man pulled out a knife and stabbed the man in the arm . Then he fell .   *What the hell ? ! *   The man awoke with a start . The bloody man was lying on the floor , his blood soaked clothes strewn across the floor .   *Did I kill anybody ? ! *   The man looked up . No one was there .   *Is this a dream ? *   The man looked around searching for anyone else , but none were there .   He grabbed his knife and opened the door . There stood a figure in the darkness . He stepped forward , extending his hand out to shake the man 's hand .   *Yes , you 're right . This is a dream . Yes , of course you are . *   The man looked up . The figure saw him and reached out . It extended a hand to shake his hand .   *No , no , no . *   The man took the hand and shook his hand back . He stood up and approached the figure . He smiled .   *Do n't worry , it 's only a dream . I 'm just the guy who sees what 's going on down there . *   The shadowy figure laughed . Then it laughed again . The man tried to move on .   *It 's just that , I 'm just the guy who sees what 's going on down there . *   The man walked towards him . He reached over and began to scratch at the man 's shoulder .   *Just that , you 're right . I 'm just the guy who sees what 's going on in the basement . *   The figure reached into his pocket and pulled out a small knife . He then stabbed the figure in the chest .   *Please ? ! Please , do n't-*   The man sighed . He took the knife in his hand . He then plunged it into his leg . He then pulled out his knife . The figure started to bleed . He dropped the knife . He put it in his pockets again . He then started to run towards the police , but stopped when he noticed that there was no one there .   'Do n't worry , I 'm just the guy who sees what 's going on down there . '   He moved towards the street . He ran so fast he could n't see himself .   *This is my dream . *
Hello , my name is Robert Stark . With all due respect , my name is Ned Stark . I did not come to be known as Robert , but I would like to welcome you to my family . For I am going to give my life for the children of Aragorn . For my name is Robert Stark . I am going to give my life for the love of my life . I am going to give my life for everything I do for a living ... so please accept my invitation and follow me to the gates before I die .   It was the middle of spring and the sky was beginning to light up . Robert walked into the ring and walked into the center of the ring . Just then he heard the first faint sound of a sound . His heart started pained , he began to cry for help and he began to scream . As he started to cry more and more he heard the sound of a young boy running . He ran far faster than the boy was supposed to jog at and over and over and over again until he stopped at a large boulder that was slightly larger than his own . Robert was frozen in fear as he waited for the boy to stop . Suddenly , he heard a loud sound like a loud explosion . He heard a large man standing over him throwing a sword at him . Suddenly , he started to feel cold to the bone . Robert then saw a large spear sticking out of the ground and slowly fell backward . The large man turned around to look at him and then slowly began to walk away . Once Robert was in the ground , he started to feel a warmth spreading from his legs . Robert looked up to see a man holding a spear , the man was holding a huge shield with a large sword , his back facing Robert . The large man slowly turned around to face him and when he looked at him again , Robert began to see that the large man was holding a dagger , the man had a large shield with a giant sword and a small shield .   `` The boy is dead . '' As the large man explained to himself , he started to feel a warm glow surround him . The large man began to walk towards Robert . It was very warm and Robert could not feel his own body . When he reached the man 's hand he grabbed the man 's hand and pulled him closer . Suddenly , he was suddenly hit with a very large object . One of the large men looked at Robert as he stared at it . `` Why was I hit ? ! '' Robert yelled with hysterics . `` Everything ... everything is ... gone . '' The large man laughed and said `` That 's impossible ! I knew I was going to die ... .I knew this day would come . The only thing I wanted to do was live ! '' The large man laughed and looked at Robert . `` But ... . you will never ... . '' Suddenly loud boom was heard and a large explosion came from the sky . The large man looked down in shock . He then heard a loud explosion as he looked up and saw a huge army of ... '' Men ! '' A shout was heard and thunder broke out near the sky . `` Our men ! '' A giant battle horn sounded . `` Our men ! Our men ! They 're coming . All the men have trained for their destiny ! '' Robert was shocked at that thought . He realized as he looked at the small army of men , all standing in formation and holding spears in hand , he realized he should probably get to the gates before he dies .   Once he arrived at the gates , he was greeted by two large men leading him to the gate . One of the young men turned around to see the giant army of men charging at the gates .   `` Sir ! '' He heard a voice behind him shout , `` Put him down ! '' ''   Without looking up , the soldiers stopped to look at him . `` What is wrong with you , son ? '' The young man asked `` You ... you 're getting closer ''   `` Did you not just hear me ? '' The giant man replied in a low voice `` I saw the news . The new king of Aragorn was killed and it has been happening for months ! ''   `` What was it ? ! Come with us ! '' The young man yelled `` There are many rumors that the man known as Tarzan is indeed Tarzan ... ''   `` So why did you kill him ? ! '' The giant man said as he pointed towards the gates . The young man reached out and pulled the young man away . His body was smashed but only his skin was still intact . After what seemed like hours , the old man was lifted up and placed on a throne .   `` I thought you all were taking orders from me . '' He said in a loud voice .   `` I thought I already said that . '' The king said calmly .
`` So , you 've seen magic ? ''   Thomas nodded to my colleague as he handed me a stack of paper . He turned to look at the paper next to him and smiled , `` Magic is like a field of fire , '' he stopped dead on his tracks . His smile vanished immediately .   I turned to Thomas , `` What ? ! '' I shouted . He looked at me cautiously , and then back at me . He had apparently forgotten that I was staring at him , and this certainly was n't a dream .   `` All of this makes sense , '' he said quietly .   `` What kind of magic is that ? ! '' I yelled again . I wanted to throw the paper into the air , but I could n't , and I froze .   `` It 's like a sort of magic source , '' Thomas said .   I turned my gaze back to him and stared at him , `` What ? ''   `` It 's magic , '' he said to me . `` It *is* magic . ''   I glanced back at him , `` Well who exactly is magic ? ''   `` The reason you 're looking at a paper is because it is a mathematical formula . ''   I turned back to him , and I took the stack of paper from him . I looked at it in horror , and then said , `` What is that ? ''   `` This , '' he said to me . `` This is a binary formula . ''   I looked at him in disbelief , '' What is this ? ''   He looked at me in disbelief , `` That 's Latin . ''   I looked at him in disbelief , `` A binary formula ! ? ''   Thomas smiled , `` Indeed . ''   He looked at me in disbelief , `` Latin is another language.. ? ''   I looked at him in disbelief ! He looked at me in disbelief !   `` It says here that Latin is a language with a three-letter word . ''   I stared at him in disbelief !   `` It says ... '' he said to me , `` ... -A-'T-N-O . ''   I blinked in disbelief !   `` Language with a three-letter word ? ''   `` Yes . ''   He looked at me in disbelief !   `` Latin is 'a-A-* ''   I looked at him in awe !   `` But what is this ? ''   He looked at me in confusion , `` It says here that Latin is a language with a three- letter word . ''   I looked at him in horrified !   I looked at him in amazement !   ...   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   **Edit** : I 'm not really sure what to do with the sentence . I thought I had n't wrote it all down .
Every Thursday I wake up in the morning . Each Saturday I get out of bed and head to the living room to watch my favourite cartoons . A movie from my favourite series ? Nope . I 'm not going to eat cereal today . I 'm going to smoke a little more cigarette and hit some on the wall .   I walked downstairs and pulled out a cigarette . I pulled it out and lit it . I had n't smoked in a long time anyway . With a long exhale I lit it and thought about how much I missed the chance to enjoy a smoke . As I was walking down the stairs I noticed something . It was a piece of paper on the desk across from me . I picked it up and read the name .   `` Jack Daniels ''
He looked like a puppy of his species , but never quite like mine . There was darkness beneath his eyes , and the occasional glimmer of light betrayed him from behind the smokey metal mask that covered him . They all wore black , and their voices sounded like gunshots and screaming . But nobody was here .   He was alone with the others here . The others were all armed , and we were all holding their weapon . We glanced around nervously , but none of them had noticed that our leader , a young woman , was approaching us . She was holding a large knife . The large weapon she held seemed to be made of glass , but still held sharp objects . I looked at my surroundings , trying to figure out what to do with this device .   We stared at each other , and then looked down in silence . The woman kept walking towards the weapons and holding it in her left hand . She pressed her other against the metal , making some small pops , and suddenly , we were all suddenly surrounded by darkness .   `` I 'm sorry , Sam , it 's just ... '' , I said , while trying to gather my thoughts .   `` Sam , sorry . Maybe it 's time we went home . '' She continued to walk towards us .   I turned to look at her , hoping I could see her face anywhere . But my eyes widened , and I turned to look at her . She was standing there , completely nude .   I ran towards her and grabbed her wrist . She was saying something . I looked back at her and saw that she was still holding the knife with her right eye of hers .   `` I thought you said something , Sam , but nobody said anything . ''   `` I would n't do that . ''   `` Then why do n't you go home ? '' I yelled at her .   `` Because I 'm scared . '' She said , while looking away .   I looked outside , and saw nothing out of the ordinary .   `` You 're a fucking dog ! You 're just a dog ! '' I shouted at her .   I turned around , and started running towards her again .   `` You 're a fucking dog ! '' I yelled at her again .   She looked back at me , and I saw nothing out of the ordinary .   `` You 're a fucking dog ! You 're just a fucking dog ! '' I yelled at her again , trying to get a couple of more guys to stay behind me and make sure I was safely away from her .   I looked at the knife in my left hand , and saw the metal itself . I looked at it , and saw the small metal blade , and the small metal man in the other . I looked at her again , and saw that she was holding the knife with her right eye of hers .   I looked at the metal man in the other . I saw his face , but nothing else .   I looked at this knife , and saw a small , black object hanging from the bottom of the knife . I looked at it again , and saw that the first few times his face looked like a small black object , but then more and more appeared .   My heart started pounding rapidly , my stomach began churning , and my vision began to blur .   Finally , I felt a bit better . I stood up , and placed the knife on my right eye , and began to slowly draw bloodstained lines on the walls . I looked at the other , and saw that it was almost completely broken .   Then I saw the person who used to be Sam , walk to the other side of the blade , and sit next to me . He looked at me , and noticed that the knife had made a sound that made it sound like a gun being pulled against your head .   He looked back at me , and asked me if I was okay .   `` It 's okay . I 'll be fine . '' I said .   I looked at the knife again , and saw the small metal man in the other . I looked at him , and saw that he was still holding the knife . I examined the small metal man in the other , and saw that he was still holding the knife , but the knife was much weaker .   Then I saw the one who used to be Sam , and watched the blood smear on the walls . As I saw the blood bleed on the walls , I heard another sound .   And a voice said , `` Thank you for your cooperation . ''   And suddenly , I was surrounded by darkness again .

An hour ago , I was sitting on the edge of the beach , watching as the sun set , and the waves had started to rise . I had been staring at the sky , thinking of the faces of the ocean , and in the middle of the waves , the waters were covered in the glow of a thousand suns , and the sea was reflected in the orange glow of the millions of suns , and the sea was reflected in the orange glow of the thousand suns , and the sea was reflected in the orange glow of the thousand suns , and that 's how the shadow moves forward .   I had watched it move , I thought I had seen it move forward , I had heard it move forward , I heard it step forward , I had heard it move forward , it had moved forwards , and the sea was reflected in the orange glow of the thousand suns , and I had heard it move forwards , and the sea was reflected in the orange glow of the thousand suns , and the sea was reflected in the orange glow of the thousand suns , and I had heard it move forwards , and I had heard it move forwards , and I had heard it move forwards , and I had heard it move forward , and the sea was reflected in the orange glow of the thousand suns , and the sea was reflected in the orange glow of the thousand suns .

*Disclaimer : This is my first attempt at writing , and I 'm honestly not sure if I could have written any better . Any and all criticism is welcome . *   My name is Alex Finckel , and I 've been working for the best of my ability . I 'm currently working a nine-month-old program that has only a couple of weeks to run and the first year is just over . I have been using the program for about a year now , but it has n't progressed much either . I have , however , been working on developing a website called Reddit .   I remember when my first thought was to become a moderator .   When the program came out , my wife and I lived in the neighborhood . We lived the most amazing neighborhood , and we lived so beautiful that we did n't get hungry , or thirsty or thirsty for our meals . We were so peaceful when we first took over . The program created beautiful neighborhoods for us to make our own lives . We had n't built much at all , but soon we were selling the program into companies that made it their own .   After about a year or so , my wife and I started working together on the program . We finally merged the program and the program allowed Reddit to be the only place we could be with other people for a year . I was working on going through our list of skills to become a moderator among the small community 's . That was when we decided it was time to start building a website called Reddit .   The website had more funding than anyone of us had anticipated . My wife and I were working on building a website called Reddit . We had taken so much from this account , and to be honest , I wanted to make sure it was at the top of Reddit 's list . We were n't allowed to go anywhere unless we had , and so we had to start working together .   The website was one of the best places on the market , and the people here were enjoying every moment of it . `` I love watching your videos , '' my wife said to me . `` I like watching your videos . ''   I knew that in order to get away from Reddit , I had to take the website with me . As soon as we left the site , I put on my headset and looked up at the moon . I jumped into my car , and sped off toward the moon ! After a few minutes , I heard a high-pitched **pop** and my wife came out the door .   `` Are you alright ? '' She asked .   `` Wha-what ? '' I stammered .   `` I am fine . Yes , I am , '' she said , her voice getting shaky . `` I am fine . I just have a moment of my life , and I am going to do my best to make sure it is done for me . ''   I tried to ignore her , but she was right . I needed to get to Reddit before it got too bad . I wanted to be able to stay there and watch videos that were made for me . I did what I could to make sure that no one else was watching it .   It took almost a week for us to get to the moon . We were out of food and sleep , but eventually we were able to get inside . We were told that there was a large box of snacks in the corner , so we followed the box . After about a foot of the stairs , we were able to pull through .   We found a huge room filled with snacks that we were eating and some cookies on our table . We had to eat carefully to keep our mouth shut , but we started to eat . Soon enough , we were able to see the roof of the underground caves below so that we could hide our fears .   Once that was done , the program was fully functional again . We had made our way up the stairs several times before we saw the bottom of a large box . The first time we saw the bottom , we were still holding our breath .   `` Are you OK , Alex Finckel ? '' She asked me , her voice getting more shaky .   I looked up at her and saw that her teeth were missing . `` Yes , I am fine . I am fine . ''   `` Where are you going ? ''   `` To the moon , '' she said . `` I 'll be back soon . I 've got a moment to celebrate , and I hope you enjoyed your meal . Do you want to go to sleep ? ''   `` I ... I ca n't , '' I said .   `` Why would you want to go to the moon ? '' 
I felt that same nervousness growing inside my chest .   I 've had over 10 years of my life 's work and not one of them will say , `` This is not right '' . I 've been doing this for months , the hours just as I 'm just taking the leap . I 've also had no idea what path to take , it ca n't be perfect , I need to become an artist . My next destination is to get creative .   I see a group of people coming towards me . `` Oh the best artist in the town ! '' Someone shouted . `` He 's a great artist , he 's perfect ! '' They all laughed .   `` Oh my god ! '' Just then , my heart skipped a beat . I 've been in this situation for years with no idea what path I 've taken .   `` Woah woah woah woah ! '' Someone yelled , `` Oh please ! '' Everyone 's head whipped to one side as some person yelled , `` Get out of the way ! '' I turned around to see another person , who in turn looked like the guy who just came from the movie . He had hair , black brown eyes , a blue suit and a black tie .   `` What the hell ? '' I said , looking around at everyone who 'd just done this . `` What do you think you 're doing ? Are you all getting bored ? ! '' Everyone slowly turned around to face me , looking at me .   `` Oh God oh my god '' Someone yelled .   `` Do n't do this ! You hear me ? ! Do n't do this ! '' Someone shouted . My heart skipped a beat .   `` No . '' I whisper as i start to slowly walk away .   `` Oh my god ! '' Someone screams , `` What the hell ? ! ''   And that was how it happened . 
The first time I saw her when I was a young boy , I thought she had the worst personality . We had been on a cruise ship that we had been studying for years , and she was there . She was beautiful , elegant , and kind . She loved to show off what others had seen . Her hair and skin were very delicate , and I admired the way they looked . It hurt the most to see them , but I was convinced she * was* . I loved the way her white dress matched the way her skin seemed to glow with something new .   The second time I saw her , I was shocked to see the people that were walking in the field , in their best dresses and even in their best outfits . Her brown hair was starting to rustle , and she was wearing thick glasses . My heart had sunk , and I was beginning to relax . What had I seen so far ? My mother used to tell me stories of her favorite women , and how she had been there for a long time . I told her that she had loved them . I told her that I had loved her . I told her she had been there for a long time , even though she had never been there for me , and that she was the only one who knew how to be kind and gentle .   The third time , I was shocked to see the people walking in the Field from afar . They were beautiful , and kind . They loved to show off what others had seen . They looked so young , and caring . They looked so healthy , and innocent . They looked to me with wonder . I asked them if they had seen me when they were young , and they said no .   The fourth time , I was surprised to see the people walking in the field from afar . They were beautiful , and kind . They looked to me with wonder . They looked to me with compassion . They looked to me with happiness . They looked to me with sadness .   There was one day , the day we would finally know who we truly were . We would finally know as one . We would finally know what we were made of . We would finally know what we were made of .
An old friend comes out of the bedroom . He 's about as tall as he is , his hair a mess with some gray . He also wears dark glasses that are on top of their neck .   `` Hey babe , '' he says , `` How 's your day ? ''   I just nod my head , and look up at him .   `` Yeah , I 'm good at school and working retail , '' I say , `` Oh and you love to dress up like that . Let 's go check out your favorite outfit . ''   He nods , and goes to get dressed for the day .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   It 's been two weeks since I 've seen him . His face is twisted and I do n't know what to think . I try to call out to him , but I ca n't understand . I can barely see the face of the person with the glasses .   `` Are you alright ? ''   `` Yeah , I 'm just trying to get some breakfast . Guess I 'm gon na have to walk to school for dinner . ''   He turns away from me and starts walking toward us . I follow him in what seems to be a slow walk . We walk down the back walk , and I look him straight in the eye .   `` Hey , '' he says , `` I 'm sorry to bother you , but I need something to eat . ''   He looks at me like I 'm crazy .   `` I would n't want to talk to you , '' he says , `` Let me get something going . ''   He pauses .   I look at him again .   He looks at me , and looks away .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Tonight , after a long day at school , I 'm finally able to finish the last day of my year . At least that 's what I think . The day before , I 'd been looking for him , but he probably would n't be there .   In the mirror today , I see my reflection looking back at me . His facial expression looks just like mine . The reflection is always smiling , smiling and smiling . Just a little less . The wrinkles on his cheeks are starting to show .   The reflection that I 'd seen online seemed a bit odd .   The reflection that I 'd seen online seemed a bit odd .   The reflection that the person I 'd seen online had the same eyes . The eyes ... on the other end of a glass ?   I looked up at him .   He was smiling .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   An old friend comes out of the bedroom . He 's about the same height as he is , his hair a mess with some gray . He also wears dark glasses that are on top of their neck .   `` Hey babe , '' he says , `` How 's your day ? ''   I just nod my head , and look up at him .   He shakes his head .   The reflection that I 'd seen online seemed a bit odd .   The reflection that he 'd seen online seemed a bit odd .   He looked up at me .   He looked at me again .   So I just nod my head .   The reflection that I 'd seen online seemed a bit odd .
`` You look like you have done some great things . ''   `` No I am not . ''   `` So you 're saying something about the past , or a machine that creates a future ? ''   `` No need to get me wrong , I am . It does n't change anything . ''   `` Wow , you 're like the most brilliant man God has ever known . ''   `` It is not wrong . ''   `` Wow , you just got married , huh ? ''   `` Of course . ''   `` Well then you have a whole family , and you 're probably the first person to travel through time to do so . ''   `` Wow , let me guess ! If you did n't travel through time , then surely you lost the only person to ever want to go back in time . ''   `` What 's wrong with me ? ''   `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I am the first person to ever go back in time , and I am going to be the first person to go back in time . ''   `` Do you really expect me to believe you ? ''   `` YES ! I do ! I 'm certain that I would be the most brilliant man God has ever known . ''   `` So what happens when you die ? ''   `` I am not really sure . I will be waiting for you to pass , but it is a long time until you pass . ''   `` Fine . ''   `` You see , my brother-in-law , is dead , so I was going to pass you . ''   `` Are you kidding me ? ''   `` Yes ! I am joking you now ! I am going to take all the knowledge you have with me , and I will make sure you remember that when you pass the time , you will be born again . ''   `` Wait ! Where am I going ? ! ''   `` Please remember that . ''   `` I know ! I know ! ''   `` Why do I have to use your language ? ''   `` I should say so now . ''   `` ... and your brother-in-law also died . ''   `` ... ''   `` Do n't worry , it is my only option . ''   `` Wait , wait ... where am I ? ''   `` You will die in this town on October 1st , 1999 . ''   `` ... ''   `` Where am I ? ''   `` You will be able to travel through time to where you died . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because , despite your great achievements , you will never be able to travel back in time . ''   `` ... ''   `` Oh , okay , okay . So you can pass me back . ''   `` Wait , so you 'll be *not* immortal ? ''   `` The sun will set in 2000 years , so you will die in a few millennia , and you will die in a couple thousand years , but at that time , you will have no idea the value that your life will bring for you . ''   `` What can anyone do about that ? ''   `` You will be given the knowledge to live another 1000 years , but you will be given the knowledge to be ... alive . ''   `` Yes , yes . ''   `` You see , it is a very special concept I have considered so long ago , but it is absolutely necessary to use it to get through this . ''   `` How would I know that ? ''   `` You will be given the knowledge to live another 1000 years , so you will not have to live another 1000 years , but you will simply live another 1000 years . ''   `` How do this work ? ''   `` Because , of course , you will die by a heartattack during the 1000 years , but you will have to live another 1000 years until the end , so that you will not die as you were when your brother-in-law died . ''   `` Okay , that sounds like a relief . ''   `` You will also know that you will have to live the same 1000 years as yourself , but have to live another 1000 years due to the fact that you do n't have to live another 1000 years . ''  
Every day , you live there on it .   Most people have n't talked about it . Not since they were born , but so many have spoken . It happens a lot when they become older , with age .   When I was younger , my friends all joked about me . Some had been the first , and some were n't . Some had been the first . Most had n't .   When my older sister passed , some were still skeptical . They said one day , that my life was n't going fine . Yet everyone thought that perhaps , once she was gone , my life would eventually be alright .   I think this had to be a test . Or maybe , for some reason , I 'm still stuck together .   The other day , My friend Simon talked about me .   Simon , it 's strange . I do n't even know who he is . I do n't even know who he is . He spoke softly to a lady , and her eyes lit up , and she smiled . I think Simon may have been more handsome , but he was n't pretty . He was just a really nice boy .   Our friends said that we could n't leave , that they had to stay out . That our lives were destined to be different . Someone had to leave this planet . It did n't have to be this way .   I could n't leave this planet . I could n't stand this . I could n't leave this planet . I could n't leave this planet .   I was so lonely .   But Simon was n't here . I was n't really alone .   Simon was n't on my tail anymore .   On my front porch , he lay on his porch , crying . He held my hand , and I kissed him .   `` It 's okay , '' I said . `` You 're here too . ''   I pulled away , and embraced him .   `` I love you , '' I said , my voice shaky . `` I love you too . ''   `` You know I ca n't leave this planet . ''   I hugged him tighter , and we embraced for several minutes . We took the pills that Simon had given us and took them to sleep . Even though I knew that there was nothing that could be done about that , I hugged him again .
`` Do n't try to make me jump , '' Professor Oak said , stroking the metal wall between them . A tall-looking man was looking at them with a small , green tinted eye .   `` Look at that face , '' Professor Oak said again , holding up his palm up above his nose , `` Look at that . ''   They turned to look at the face , studying it , before turning to see Professor Oak standing just a few feet away . Professor Oak raised his hand and the man in the green tinted eye winked at Professor Oak .   `` Your face is wearing an odd mask of sorts . ''   `` What are you going to do ? ''   Professor Oak gave the man a look that told the man that he was crazy .   `` Well ... one of the oldest ways to travel , but we still have time travel , do n't you think ? It 's simple that we do n't have to worry about making the jump . ''   Professor Oak watched the man stand , observing him closely from the footpath . He could see the lab coat was obviously different from the typical jumpsuit , and was wearing some kind of helmet to hide behind . Where in the world the man in the green tinted eye did n't look like Professor Oak thought the Professor was from , Professor Oak just assumed that it was a man from different time and place .   `` If you 're from the early 21st century , then who are you ? ''   `` I am from the time of the founding fathers ; who are you ? ''   `` I am the inventor of what is called a Time Machine . ''   `` I see ! ''   `` Excellent ! I have proof of time travel ! Are you ready ? ''   The man in the green tinted eye looked down at his clipboard and tapped his pen , then went straight to his black and white watch .   `` Now , where are we going to start ? ''   `` To get to the time of the founding fathers , the people of this world , '' the man in the green tinted eye said , but did n't look embarrassed .   A small red button on the bottom of the wall pressed above his shoulder .   `` Now , where are we going to start ? ''   `` To get to the time of the founding fathers , the people of this world , '' the man in the green tinted eye said , again the exact same time , `` and get there . ''   Professor Oak watched as the man in the green tinted eye pushed his hand into the button , then turned towards the door , almost turning into a street , before turning to face the Professor .   `` Do n't try to jump , '' Professor Oak said , stopping for a moment , `` I 'm afraid you may not realize that it 's very complicated . ''   `` What the hell am I talking about ? ''   The man in the green tinted eye pressed a button on the bottom of the wall and the man in the green tinted eye was gone .   Professor Oak stood up and looked around , looking for an exit .   `` What do you want ? '' He said , looking down at his clipboard and tapping his pen again .   A small red button sat at the bottom of the wall , then it lit up .   `` Now , where are we going to start ? ''
`` Well if you 'll excuse me , it does n't do anything to *us* . ''   I had a blank stare on my face .   `` I would advise you to do it yourself , *cough* . It 's a terrible thing , but you really should be concerned . ''   I felt my mouth drop open . I could see little bits of spit coming from my ears and , when the saliva finally cleared , I noticed a small circle in the corner of my mouth .   `` What ? ''   A small oval in the corners of my mouth .   I was beginning to wonder if I should try something ... Or just *take a leak* .   `` Maybe I should check it out . ''   I quickly looked at my kitchen . It was empty , except for the potted plants and flowers in the corner .   `` Nothing ? What are you doing ? What 's wrong ? ''   My stomach was churning , but I could feel my bones cracking beneath the weight of the anxiety .   `` Well , we should hurry . ''   I closed my eyes .   `` It 's a miracle to have a giant potato in your dining room . ''   I started to feel sick , and tried to stay calm .   `` What 's wrong with your potato ? ''   I could hear my roommate calling from downstairs . He was n't coming back ; his face still covered in bruises . He had a large piece of a potato in the shape of his fist .   `` Look , I know it 's terrible . My dad used to tell me sometimes that we 'll get sick of the potato . ''   `` I do n't care , dude . What is it ? ''   `` Let 's get this over with . ''   I rolled over and looked over at my fridge . All that was there was the potato , a single potted plant with six legs , and two arms , and the ceiling above it with two chairs and a window .   `` It 's weird . There 's a door to you right here . ''   I opened the fridge and pulled out a little bowl from the bottom of it . I put it in front of me .   `` Here , get it . ''   I picked the bowl up .   `` This is great , man . ''   `` What 's wrong with your potato ? ''   `` A little bit of cheese . ''   `` Wow , hey man . Have you tried the same thing ? ''   I looked around . I was looking for my oven , but there was n't anywhere else around . I stood up , stretching .   `` Fuck you . ''   I laid my arm against the microwave button .   `` You 're a *good guy* . ''
I found a dead body laying in a field near the coast of Panama . His head was cut off , his eyes were closed , his neck was still attached to something , he had his hand on it and my heart was beating fast . I could feel my soul being ripped apart in one go . I closed my eyes and began to drift away , moving on .   I sat in my recliner , looking at my phone . *God dammit , what do I do ? I only know this from a few days ago* , I thought .   The numbers on the screen showed 8:59 , I walked into my room and grabbed my phone and waited for it to turn on . Instead , it turned again . `` Hello ? '' I asked .   `` Uh , hello ? Can I help you ? ''   `` Are you alright ? Can you hear me ? ''   `` No , I- I ... . ''   `` That 's okay , there 's something wrong . ''   `` Listen , I know you 're not the only one . We 've found your body , and we 're very sorry . But all of this has to be put on hold , to release everyone and everyone of this island . As they say , you 're the only one left . You 'll be in a very long time before you have the opportunity to join us on a journey , otherwise you 're dead . ''   I thought for a moment about it , then tried to think of something to say , anything . Then I remembered my parents . They were in the business of making people happy , and I had never heard of one actually happy . *So I 'll just let them go ? * I thought , and then grabbed the phone off my nightstand and dialed 911 .   `` E-hello ? Can I help you ? ''   `` Uhh , I-I need you to come with us , '' I said .   `` Yes , thank you . ''   `` Okay Okay . I-I 'll take a seat , is everything alright ? Everything okay ? ''   `` Oh no , no , thank you , I-I 'm okay . It 's alright . It means everything to me . I love you , but I need you to come with me , so please come with us . ''   I hung up the phone and walked through to the back cabin . I looked over at the body and felt a bit shocked . Was this what they said about taking people away ? Was this what the beach was like ? I decided I could n't accept it , but I really wanted to do something . To tell people that I loved them . That I loved them for who they were .   When I entered the house , I saw what looked like an ambulance . It was too kind and I needed to get rid of the body . I walked over to it and picked up the phone . `` Hello ? ''   `` It 's alright , I 'm here , '' a female voice said .   `` Okay , so go ahead , help me . Listen . You 're coming with us now . ''   `` Yeah , okay , thank you . I 'll wait . ''   When I got in , the woman showed me her ID . `` Who is this ? ''   `` This is me , '' I said .   `` I 'm your wife , '' the woman said .   `` Oh , thank you , '' I said .   `` How do you know I 'm going to come with you ? ''   `` I just came for you . ''   `` But how do you know she 's dead ? ''   `` I 'm sorry , I do n't know . I was going to ask you one more time if you could please explain . ''   `` Wait , so I 'm in a car , then ? ''   `` Um , yes , I think you need me to come with you further . ''   For a moment , I thought about asking `` Where are you ? '' but then I remembered that I needed to get away from this place before it all fell apart . I turned around . There was a large , abandoned van parked at the side of the road . I took out my phone and dialed 911 .   `` E-hello ? Can I help you ? ''   Another woman burst out of the van and dropped it . `` Uh , yes , I 'm sorry , I 'm here , '' she said . 
`` I have to say that I was a great choice for you . This was your perfect opportunity , '' I explained .   I looked around the mall , which I found so strange that they took me to a different branch of the mall . `` I know , '' I said .   `` But I ca n't feel like we 've met . ''   `` We have n't , either . I 'm just so scared . You 've got to be kidding me I have a job , '' I said .   `` Not really , '' said the blonde girl on the other side of me . She seemed to be working with just one of the other couples that gave me money .   `` Please , let me ask you something . ''   `` I 'm afraid we 're not on the same path , '' I said . `` My life is n't like that . I would love to travel somewhere else . ''   `` Or , maybe , I could travel all over again , '' she said . She seemed to get a bit farther away from me , and I noticed that she was actually there . `` Like , she knows we 're on the same path , and is n't trying to travel on that side . What do you think her idea of travelling on that side is ? ''   `` Do n't you think that maybe we 're on the same path ? '' asked the blonde girl . I just stood there , and watched her go about her work , and suddenly , I felt a huge , guttural feeling across my entire body .   `` You 're not joking , '' I said .   `` What ? ''   `` I mean ... you 're not joking , I mean , I think I already know . You 're just doing her job . You 're doing her job . You 're doing her job . I know you see her sometimes . ''   `` They do n't see me ? ''   `` They never see you . ''   `` But ... where did she get that idea from ? ''   `` She always uses it on herself . She always used it on herself . ''   `` You do n't see her anymore ? ''   `` Yes , and I would n't . I 'm sorry I 'm such a strange and strange and terrible man . But I will never hurt anyone again . I will never hurt anyone again . So , tell me , what do you do in that relationship ? ''   `` Well , I do n't know , '' I said . `` It changes her image to make her more , to make it more real . I do n't know what to say . Maybe I 'll tell her how things go ? When she 's got those freaky ideas , she 'll be looking at me like I 'm some creepy , creepy version of her . You do n't have to say that . ''   `` So , tell her how things go ? ''   `` When she 's done making all those freaky ideas , she 'll be looking at me like I 'm some creepy , creepy version of her . Like I 'm some creepy , weird version of her . She 'll be looking at me like I 'm some creepy , creepy version of her . She 'll be looking over me like I 'm some creepy , creepy version of her . Maybe she 'll be looking over me like I 'm some creepy , creepy version of her . Or she 'll be looking over me like I- ''   `` What 's the harm in that ? ''   `` You can say that . If you want to get you out of here , go to jail . That 's why you 're so difficult that you never have a job . ''   `` But ... I 'm pregnant . I am n't pregnant . I 'm pregnant . ''   `` If you want to get out of here , go to the hospital . Do n't worry about it . It 'll be fine . If you do n't want to get out of here , get out alive , you 'll be in a hospital . I do n't want to be pregnant . ''   `` But ... I 'm pregnant ! ''   `` If you want to get out of here , get out alive , you 'll be in a hospital . Go to the hospital . Do n't worry about it . You 'll be in a hospital . Leave the hospital . Do n't go to the hospital . Get out . ''   `` So ... if I do n
I am a lonely man . I have no money to buy the things I want , except for a few books , a small laptop and a few books . No children . No money to buy the things I want . All I will ever want is to be a better person .  The days are uneventful , day by day . I am always looking forward to the day when I can be back home . This is what I get for living with my family . I have no money to buy any books , but the book is mine . It has got to be mine .  I get to do something different every day . I can not just put it back , but I can make it better every day because I want that book to look good on me . I wish I could do something to make it better .   I write a diary . I write a lot of things . Some are just a bit of a blur , a bit of a dream . I like to write things that I know are important to the person in the diary , but not just for me . I write something for my family . I need to give them something .   I have to do something . Today is the day that I change my mind . I am going to buy something . I do n't know what it will be , but I want to give it away and see what it feels like . I want to be a better person .   I write a lot of things . I wrote a lot of things . I know everything about cats and bees . I know everything about cats and ants . I know how to clean my house and make sure that it does n't hurt . I know that I can not let myself go through the stuff . Sometimes I do n't even remember what I wrote .   I have to do something . I have to do something . I have to write something . Something that would make me better . Something that would help my family .  I do n't know anything . I am scared .   I have to be okay with this though . I am going to buy this book .   It is probably just a hallucination , and I think that it is , but I have to stay calm . I look at the front page . There are a lot of pictures of cats and ants in the front page . There are pictures of a man in the front row and a girl in that dress . My heart sinks deeper and deeper until I ca n't sit frozen . I fall to the ground . I ca n't move . I ca n't see .   I do n't know what I am or what is happening . I just know that it IS . A hallucination .
The small town of Croft City is quiet , save for the low whistling of the birds . Children have been playing in a nearby park , but they do not wan na chase them from the trees . A man approaches , and looks down at his daughter , who looks up and smiles . Then he stops , and closes his mouth , thinking about his daughter . When he sees her smiling , he reaches for his pistol . He pulls the trigger , and the world goes black .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The boy runs towards a large town , and quickly closes his eyes . He tries to close them , then he remembers . In a moment , he is surrounded by villagers , his home surrounded by empty houses and empty streets . Then he saw a young boy , running away from the boy , heading for a nearby farm .   The boy begins to understand what he just was , and he quickly moves around to face the boy . He tries to hold his daughter close , but there is nothing . He tries to scream , but there is nothing . The boy is now surrounded by his own family , and he is afraid of what he is doing . He sees the boy , and he remembers . He sees him , screaming . He is crying . He knows what he has done . He does n't want to live anymore . He is angry . Why are they so mean . They do n't care . They do n't realize . He is afraid , and he is scared .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The boy looks out over his village , and sees a man running towards him , but he does not stop . He tries to shout , but his sound has stopped . He realizes that he has closed his eyes . He opens them again . He is alone , alone . He has not been alone ever , and yet , he is afraid .   -- -- --   The boy lies on the ground , bleeding profusely on the ground , the words `` Croft City '' spread through his mind . This is the boy who he has met , and he remembers everything . He remembers everything he said , and he knows that he has lived so long . Finally , he is truly alone .   The boy lays in front of a church , and sees a priest talking to him over a large glass tower . The priest is holding a large , large cross . The boy is not worried about him , but he is confused . The priest kneels down , and approaches the boy on the ground , and begins to speak .   `` My Lord , my child , the man in front of you is ... '' the words are cut short by another gunshot , and the man in front of him is blown off of the ground , dead . The boy looks up at the priest , and sees the man standing over him , holding a large cross . The man begins to take the cross and place it on the ground . The boy , who has died in his own home , looks up at the priest .   `` Why do you bring me here ? Why do you call me here ? '' the priest asks .   The boy starts to cry , and the priest begins to remove the cross from the ground . The boy screams , and screams , until his throat burns . He cries harder , and the priest removes the cross from the ground , and throws the boy into the sea .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The boy was brought back to the boy , to the priest , to his death . He tried to say hello to him , to comfort him , and to hold him tight . But , there was only a wheeze . It came from his throat . The priest lifted his nose and smeared his face with blood .   `` What happened ? ''   `` Please , Father , tell me something , '' the boy pleaded , but the priest was silent .   `` What happened ? ''   `` ... what happened last year ? It happened last year , and I was just a kid . ''   The boy stared at the priest for a minute , then continued , `` This man , the man I met , killed my father
`` I love you ''   `` I love you too ''   The sound of her voice echoed off the walls of the warehouse , the walls made of steel and stone .   He stood in the hallway , the doors at the end of the hall leading to the waiting room , a small , dark room with a white table underneath .   The door opened and she sat down on the chair beside him .   `` We have to talk about this . ''   He looked over at her . His eyes met hers . Her love for him was something he had grown over the past month .   `` I know ''   She smiled .   `` But if we just talk , I wo n't be able to take everything from you ''   He smiled and grabbed her . She embraced him and he kissed her back .   `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` This is the best thing to ever happen to me . ''   `` It is , '' she smiled .   `` It is . ''   She kissed him again .   `` I love you , too . ''   The door was shut again . He reached for his knife . 
I was finally home . My heart melted into my chest . My breath came out in a long burst , but my heart was in the right place . There 's no point in hiding now , no point in running . I was finally home . My eyes raced in fear . An unknown terror spread throughout my entire world . I gripped my father 's hand . The other man had a gun in his chest . My breath came out in a long burst , but my heart was in the right places . I was finally home . My heartbeat came out in a very long burst , but my heart was in the right place . There 's no point in hiding now , no point in running .
“ I ’ m so sorry , I didn ’ t do it. ” My brother was staring at me with a mix of disgust , disbelief , and grief in his eyes . His words echoed throughout the room as I sat there for what seemed like an eternity . I stared at his face , mouth open to stare at my own eyes . The only one I ’ d ever known was mine .   “ It was my brother , ” his voice was soft and almost comforting , though I didn ’ t understand how it came to be . “ I just do…I just want to stop . It wouldn ’ t be easy if it weren ’ t for you , mom. ”   I looked away from him and down at my bloodied hands . My hands were shaking so hard that I felt the ground underneath me shake . I shook my head and turned away from him through tears of sorrow . My parents stood there silently and I knew they couldn ’ t help but think about my brother and how they were so determined to save me .   It came to me that I wasn ’ t sure what to do anymore . Looking at my hands , I could see they were shaking themselves , but I wasn ’ t sure what they were meant to do anymore . They were the kind of hands that they would shake and I knew that if I stopped shaking , then it would end with me doing its best for myself . I shook my head violently , my father ’ s hand hovering over my shoulder , smiling softly as he stood up and walked toward the living room .   “ You just need to stop shaking. ”   He smiled as he walked back in , closing the front door behind him .   “ I love you , honey. ” 
The light is still still there . I barely notice , but it has always been there . I begin to count the years , the days , the years of my life . It has always been there .   I realize that now , despite my current situation , I can never remember the past . My memory lacks any memories . It does not exist .   It has always been there .   My wife and I had gotten married a couple of months ago . By the time we met , it was too late .   I am alone .   I know I have to take care of my daughter . My wife is cheating on me , and my daughter is dying because of me . My daughter is dying because of me .   I know that when she turns 16 , I will die because of my wife .   I know she has to go .   I know that when she turns 16 , she will die because of me .
It 's been two hundred years since I killed my child .   I was lucky , as much as you could imagine . I had a great-granddad , and his two-legged sons who had developed a strong sense of love and kindness . They had been born in a small village under the name of the house of the king , and would always love to fly around and play with the ducks . A strange thing happened when they saw me .   In front of them flew a big , black thing that resembled a spider , with a large , black eye staring daggers in my direction . I knew first hand what this thing was : a giant spider .   I looked at the terrified little creatures , and in their eyes I saw something I had never seen before . The hatred of flying , the hate of being shot , the hatred of my own parents , etc. , they all had a feeling of hate .   It was then that I realized : there was no such thing as a giant spider , and even then , I had no idea what it was for .   *****   If you enjoyed this , consider subscribing to [ r/MaisieKlaassen ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/MaisieKlaassen/ ) .    
Life had seemed peaceful for me . It was an uncharacteristic event to be honest .   On this huge rock , about four centuries ago , I had received the lottery ticket . It was an honor to be chosen .   The world felt it 's eyes on me . Some were looking at me . Some were looking at the lottery ticket . They started to speak .   `` Humans , '' they spoke in tongues that looked like the teeth of a snake , `` have been selected . We are here to retrieve you . You may choose to end our existence , or begin our destruction . All decisions based upon our actions will not be tolerated . Sooner or later , you will be selected as the first person to be selected as the second person to be selected , after which you will forever live in hope that this will not be the first choice . ''   There was a pause . The world then turned its eyes towards me .   `` No , no . There never will be another person , '' it said . `` You will forever live in hope that this will not be the first choice . You will forever be alive in hope that this will never be the first choice . You will forever be alive in hope that this will never be the first choice . ''   I sat there , in a daze . I no longer felt alone anymore . I heard cars passing by . I saw people walking by me . I did not feel alone anymore .   `` It 's all over , '' the man on the truck said , `` we 've won . You have made it . ''   I stared at the man on the truck for a few seconds , then spoke .   `` No . I wo n't let you keep doing this . I 'll let you go . You must understand this is not the right decision . ''  *If it was* , I would be in a better place . I would be in a better place .   The man on the truck nodded . `` You 're right . We must accept . We must destroy our creation . You must live in hope that this will not be the first choice . You must live just like all of us . ''   I began to cry .   `` You did n't tell me , '' the man on the truck said . `` You never told me . You do n't know what I did . You did n't know that we were the ones that sent you to Earth . ''   The man on the truck looked at me .   `` This is n't right , '' I replied . `` It 's not right ! ''   The man on the truck looked at me again .   `` That 's not what you told me . That 's not what I told you . ''   I sighed .   `` I wo n't let you take another of your friends . You do n't understand . You do n't know that you 're the only one . ''   `` You 're right . You must sacrifice yourself , '' the man on the truck said .   I cried as I opened the door to the street outside . I walked to my car and drove the rest of the way home . I started to see what happened in the world . I always thought that the universe was something more . Something far more sinister than the one we had created . But there was never enough time to tell you that .   The sun sat low in the sky today . I looked at the sky in my room . I did n't know why . I suppose I was wondering if I should ever do what was to be my final decision .   I sat on my bed , facing the ceiling . I had just come out to do something stupid . I grabbed a knife and cut some chunks off the roof . I pulled off a piece of wall and threw it at the window . I was staring straight into the fire . It seemed to just grow brighter . I was watching my friends die .   In front of me , the ground was shaking . I looked down at myself . I looked at myself . I looked up into the sky . All of a sudden , I saw a light coming from above me .   Its blinding blue rays illuminated my vision as the light moved closer , closer to me . I was standing on my front porch , looking up at the sky .   The light came closer . I looked at myself and saw myself .   I was in my front lawn , looking down at myself , looking up at the sky .   The light was coming closer . I looked up at the sky again . 
`` It 's just all lies , '' Sarah said , clutching her baby close to her chest .   `` I know , '' I replied , the tears in my eyes still dripping slowly from the wet droplets .   Sarah 's screams had been soothing , but the tears rolled down her cheeks and onto the soft , baby shoulder .   I looked up from the blankets , and saw the same expression on his face : relief .   Sarah 's voice had stopped . I knew what this meant , of course : he would understand .   And he would .   Sarah grabbed my hair and held it tight . We both stared at each other , my body shaking .   `` I know , '' I said , finally letting go of my hair and covering it .   `` We all have . ''   I whispered in his ear .
( I 'm not a writer , but here goes nothing . )   The clock on the door chimed . 10:34 AM .   The office chair creaked as I sat in it . The man behind me began to rattle on his computer .   I looked up at him .   He was holding back tears , and he sat back down at his desk . The soggy orange folder on his desk began to bulge in front of him .  I tried to sit up to look at it . It was only a few feet long . There was a large , wooden , wooden desk in the door that he stood behind .   “ Dad ? Mom ? ”   The last thing I heard was the shout of our children from across the room . Then the sound of death coming from the office door .   **CLICK**   6.25 AM .   A slight buzz was heard in the office , and my head suddenly throbbed . As I rose from my desk , I picked up the phone to call my wife .   “ Hey , sweetie , what ’ s up ? ” she said .   I nodded . “ Great ! I ’ ve got a couple of news channels and I have a couple of new friends . They were just going to see if I could give them this a couple of weeks . I think I ’ m going to call them and tell them I can ’ t do this anymore. ”   “ Oh , honey , I just want to go home . I need to go to my aunt and uncle ’ s house. ”   “ Alright . Your aunt and uncle will be at 2:30 PM . I can have breakfast with them for the whole day . They should be busy. ”   I hung up the phone .   I walked over to my cousin and his father . They were sitting in the living room and were both staring at their phones . I took a deep breath and stepped back into my office chair .   “ So what do you think ? ”   “ I think we should have something to talk about today. ”   “ Well , I uh… uh… ”   “ Shut up . I don ’ t care if it ’ s the news or not . It ’ s important. ”   “ Dad , I can ’ t believe this happened. ”   “ Your sister ’ s getting worried . She ’ s barely paying my rent today . Your brother is going to be home late the next day with a bunch of work. ”   “ Just shut up . I ’ m still not in awe of what happened. ”   “ I know , but I just need to talk to my father . He ’ s so excited to see you are up and coming. ”   “ I know sweetie . I know. ”   I sat down at my computer and laid the headset on .   *Crack*   I looked up to see my boss shaking his head .   “ You need to calm down. ”   “ I don ’ t know . Okay. ”   “ What happens now ? ”   “ They call me into work . They tell me that my niece , Elizabeth , has been diagnosed with cancer . She ’ s been suffering from delusions , schizophrenia . They want to check her out before they have her terminated , but… ”   “ That ’ s ridiculous ! You think we would have something to talk about today ? To see you suffer from delusions ? ”   “ Relax , honey. ”   I put my hands on my knees and looked up at my boss . His head was spinning . He was shaking . His brown eyes were closed . His brow was creased . His body had started to nod at a certain point . I thought I heard his voice .   “ I ’ m sorry , I ’ ll leave. ”   “ Leave you alone , sweetie . I ’ ll talk to his aunt at 8.30pm. ”   “ Goodbye . Bye. ”   *Crack*   11.02 AM .   A heavy , heavy knock sounded in the
The first day I got my first blood test passed was the hardest day of my life . As the hours dragged by , I began to realise that I was n't really as good or strong as I used to be . I 'd never been this strong before , but I always felt strong . Something that the men and women around me were worried about . It was my constant and unchanging fear that kept me constantly on guard . Today one was different .   My patient opened the door and walked in immediately , he was tall and muscular , I had n't seen him in years .   `` Hi John , I 'm Jim , '' he says . `` What 's up ? I 'm here for my tests . If you did n't mind , I 'll be right here for you . ''   I stared at him for some time , almost lost in thought . I did n't know what to say . I still felt weak . But somehow , I was ready for him to begin the test .   I walked into the building and a few guys behind me started shouting at them . I could n't bare to look at them , there were hundreds of them all . The professor walked over .   `` So , do n't worry , I 'll be right here , right here for us , '' he said . He opened the door . I had never seen him before .   The next day , I had gotten an unknown visitor . I knew him . I knew what he was planning .   `` Excuse me , John , '' said the officer who escorted me to the clinic .   `` Hello , '' I replied slowly . `` Hi Jim . How are you feeling today ? ''   `` Well , '' said the officer as he handed me an envelope . `` You 're feeling great . And a little weird . So , how are you feeling today ? ''   `` Well , '' I responded , `` I 'm feeling an ok. ''   `` Well . So what could be troubling you ? I 'm feeling better . Why do n't you meet me outside for a meeting ? It 's late . ''   `` I do n't know , '' I answered . `` I just feel the same . ''   The officer handed me a note .   *Dear Jim , *   *You have suffered through a rare blood epidemic . Your cancer will have progressed to its inevitable stage of metastasising , and your disease will leave you with just one chance to recover . This is the only way now that you can manage to survive . You will be able to continue to live . *   *Sincerely , Jim*   *All these years*   *Sincerely*   *Sincerely , Jim* 
He had to stand fast and think fast , his legs carried him by the cold air . He was not sure if he would ever make it this far , or just continue through the wilderness . The smell of pine hung at his nose , but he could smell the forest : forest is not what a forest hides .   He had to think fast and think fast . The forest does not hide him . It is what a forest hides . His legs carry him by the cold air .   The sound of wood creaking against leaves made him think . Looking down he saw that his legs had been ripped out , and had taken root with a bit of pine . He could feel the fear growing in his stomach , as if it were tearing the branches off his leg .   “ What is this ? ” he murmured to himself .   He saw a girl standing at the edge of the forest , in a black tree branch . She was holding a knife in her hand and her arms wrapped around a large knife .   “ Help me ! ” She begged . “ I need help ! ”   The girl looked at him , confused , and then fell to the floor with a wet thud .   At this point , he decided to lay down and wait for the forest to close in . He put his tired legs on the ground and reached towards the girl . He grabbed the girl by her hair and pulled her into his arms .   “ You are safe , ” he whispered . “ You are safe. ”   The girl shook her head and looked up at him . “ No. ”   He reached a hand out and touched her face .   “ Stop this ! ” He cried . “ Stop hiding me ! ”   The girl started sobbing uncontrollably and pointed to the tree trunk in the distance .   “ Please , don ’ t go. ” Her voice finally shook with fear .   She looked towards the tree trunk . “ Please . Stop . Please ! ”   He tried reaching behind her . He could smell the pine . He noticed that the girl was struggling with herself , her legs were n't strong enough to support her .   She was staring at the trunk . “ Please . It ’ s okay. ”   He reached into a pocket and pulled out a knife . He was about to stab the girl onto her neck , but he saw that the blade was still wrapped around the girl ’ s neck .   He grabbed the knife . “ Let me go ! ”   A feeling of numbness crept into his stomach , until it slowly subsided .   He let out an excited cry . “ I ’ m going to kill her ! I ’ m going to kill her ! ”   He let out a chuckle . “ We will do this again , ” he said .   The sound of wood creaking against leaves made the girl cry .  
`` What is the meaning of what is being said ? ''   The reporter looked up at the President of the United States . `` Sir , we are talking about the President of the United States , and it is very important . ''   `` The President of The United States , of course , '' the President continued . `` He has led us to believe that it was true . ''   `` Is your information false ? ''   The President gave a grim look . `` I expect so . However , it is not a lie . It was just a joke . ''   `` But ... ''   The President looked back to the reporter and smiled . `` It is n't an actual joke nor will it be . ''   The reporter paused . `` I am afraid you are mistaken . ''   `` Do you believe that ? ''   The reporter looked up . `` I believe that , yes . For that I can not assure you . '' He nodded .   `` Thank you . ''   The President stood there for a while . The man shook his head as if to say , `` I do n't understand . ''   The reporter stood there looking at the President again , still smiling . `` May I ask a question ? ''   `` What is the meaning of what is being said ? ''   `` Sir , there is no meaning in asking . For that , it is no truth . Only the truth . ''   The President looked back at him now . `` I have doubts that I understand that fact . You are n't delusional . ''   The reporter turned his head . `` I have no doubt that this is a practical joke . ''   `` Indeed it is . But sir , I believe that you have mistaken it , a * practical joke* , '' the President said , with a grin .   `` What lies behind that smile ? ''   The reporter looked back up at the President and smiled . `` You are a fool . Very foolish . One of our greatest heroes , and perhaps the most terrible . He was a great fool - a great man who spent his whole life in danger . A great man that could save thousands of lives , but ultimately never stopped . He was brave . He was brave . He was brave . ''   A pause , and a moment of cold silence . The President looked back up at the Director . `` Do you believe that perhaps the President of the United States is a great hero ? ''   `` If you are truly this great hero , I would call you a fool . You do not deserve that title . ''   The President felt the anger rise in his stomach . `` Why would you do that ? ''   `` Because ... I believe that what you are saying will be true . ''   `` Why does that mean that I am going to believe that ? ''   The President sighed . `` Because I would rather live to see my family grow old without fear of death . I would rather live to see my grandchildren grow up without fear of death . ''   The Director shrugged . `` You do n't have to believe anything anymore . I mean , do you believe in what you believe ? ''   The President looked back up . `` What do you believe is the meaning of what is being said ? ''   The Director reached for his gun , but the President hesitated . `` I believe that that is what lies behind it . ''   The President looked back at the President , and smiled . Not on his face , but on his forehead . `` You are mistaken .

Today , the subway derailed .   That ’ s how it usually goes . I see it happen in movies and on books . People do it on purpose .   *What happened next ? *   I turn my eyes to the train tracks , where a police car is honking its horn . It starts barking . I turn my head and see a bright red light , flashing behind me .   I turn my head slowly , knowing that the train is on its way out of town . More cars start screeching at the station , but it ’ s too late .   The red light shines again , and I am pulled down to an asphalt road . The car with me is speeding towards me .   I get hit in the head , and then I fall to the ground . The car with me is gone .   I wake up to a bright red light , flashing behind me . 
`` So , '' he began , '' a little over a fortnight ago , I was traveling in Rome , with a full crew of mercenaries . Our men were stationed in a small , isolated city on the outskirts of the empire , as far away from the gates as possible . We 'd been told that the city was the very center of the Roman Empire , yet we knew of it , and from what I saw on the news , we were told that it was not .   He paused , and looked at me questioningly , '' So , it was just a few men , then ? '' He continued , `` they were stationed in a small settlement in the inner city of Rome , which had no roads or roads . In fact , their lives were on the edge of certain death . '' Silence hung for a few moments , then he said , '' So , one day , an ambush from a small force came through the outermost walls of the settlement , and the men charged right into the front line . ''   I looked at him with curious eyes , '' Is ... is that ... Is that the reason we were here ? ''   He looked at me again , `` Yes , the reason . But , the enemy had taken my life . We were prepared as best we could for it . Our legionnaires were to be sent to the rear line , and after a short period of time , they reached one of the walls . A short , wooden door was opened with a few arrows puncturing the door , and two men guarding it burst through . Upon being pushed inside , a pair of soldiers with rifles followed .   Just walking in , the soldiers had set up a makeshift barricade against the wall , and then took out their phones and tablets and tablets . They , one of the soldiers , was typing something into them , and they looked down to the screen in disbelief . They saw a line of blue and red text across the screen , before they began to frantically type . Then , suddenly , two soldiers came out of an ambush , one of the men in charge , and tackled the other into the wall . The other man was pinned down , and they began to take the soldier by the arm , who then threw him into the ground . ''   I looked at him , '' What ? '' I asked .   He paused , and then looked at me cautiously , '' I was in Rome , but in a place devoid of life and culture . At the time , I was in a monastery , where I spent most of my time meditating . On the day leading up to the attack , I felt a strange feeling . I opened my eyes , and my surroundings were as though I had seen a ghost . Just as I was starting to regain my consciousness , I heard one of the men shouting at me . It was not a man . It was a woman . She was carrying a handgun , and said something- but no amount of calming words could help me describe it .   She explained the situation , and said , '' That is how I became Emperor of Rome . When I died , my people came to see me as their savior , and they would feast upon my bodies . As I died , my people began to worship me as my new Emperor , and I began to live in a world free from death , but because of my deeds , I became Emperor of Rome . ''   I looked at her again , `` How did you get this number ? ''   She stated , '' I must have known you were the only one who knew the name for your people , and at the time , I thought you were a great liar . You did n't know how to use these numbers . You merely said that they were random , and that , unlike the ones you showed up to , they were quite ordinary . ''   I stared at her , and said , '' So ... why ? ''   She said , '' I thought we 'd be rich , but I do n't think I ever knew that . ''   And then , she said , '' So what happens afterwards ? ''   She said , '' I do n't know . ''   She said , '' After that , I thought the Romans would not be interested in me , so I made a deal with them . I promised to make them wait until I died , but as time passed , my people grew jealous of me . They did n't care that I died , and after what seemed like the longest time , I was a legend . ''   I started to cry and cried for hours , and eventually , after what seemed like forever , I broke down . I was begging them to buy me a new life , and they did . But , as I was trying to convince them , they did what they had to do ,
The first thing to happen was that they all became aware .   At first they thought that they were imagining things . Then they realized they had just died . The smell of rotting flesh , the smell of rotting flesh , the feeling of disquiet and the absence of company .   But it did n't last . Nothing mattered .   After a few months of constant staring at the sky , nothing happened .   When there was no one to judge , the rules of the world were simply set . The same rules as when you had just passed out , the same rules of your mind .   You are a ghost . You do n't have to see anything . You can always see .   You never really understand the rules .   The first thing you ever noticed was that all the events were happening around you . Everyone was talking , talking , talking . People started moving towards the edge of the cliff . Families were taking care of their kids . I saw these people move a little faster , each time they went to the edge , leaving behind many trails behind .   I saw them . They were n't moving for what felt like miles . They just moved . The people looked like they were moving at an incredible speed . The people stopped moving . The people who looked up at me seemed to just have moved at the same rate .   I was n't scared . Still , I looked up at the sky .   I noticed the people , too . They were all moving at incredible speeds , taking care of their kids . The people who looked at me looked at me .   Then , I realized why the rules were set . I was n't human anymore . I was n't alive . I was n't ...   I was n't ...   I was n't ...   I was almost ...   ...   I can see the world around me . I can see what 's going on , and what 's about to happen . I can see everything . Everything I have ever known . Everything I know in order to keep tabs on everyone else .   I can see the future . I can see the future . Now , I can see what 's going on . I can see everything .   Now , there are few people left . I was the last person to see the future . The current to see the future . I left behind so many people still around me .   So ...   Now ... I can see the world around me . I can see everything now .   I can see the people on the cliff . I can see everything now .   I can see everything .
“ This is not the first time it has happened , ” said John as he took a seat on the whiteboard . It was just a whiteboard , with only a single screen of text . He looked up , and saw that it was a single page , with only one page . He took a deep breath . “ This is not the first time this has happened. ”   “ How can this be ? ” said John , bewildered . “ All the time ? ”   “ The power of discovery was never discovered. ”   “ So ? ”   “ It was found in Switzerland. ”   John looked around , and saw that the same screens all around him were displaying meaningless information . He stared at them , thinking that if someone had ever discovered something so important , they would be happy for it . One by one , they reached out their hands , and felt an enormous hand grasp onto them , and they were free .   “ What made them ? ” John shouted , staring at the screen . He looked around , and saw that all the cars were stopped in their tracks , and were going to be stuck on earth . “ What made us ? ” John muttered to himself .   “ One by one , their fingers came down upon the key , and they were sealed . Their body was freed . And they were named Peter . Peter said that in all their infinite wisdom , he must have sent them to some other place , or else they would die by the power of discovery . Peter said that in all his vast wisdom , they must have found a key in heaven , and destroyed it , because of that. ”   John realized that his words were incoherent , and that he was absolutely hopeless . He went silent .   “ Please god , please let me go. ” said John . “ Please please please let me go. ”   “ I can ’ t , ” he spoke , unable to contain his sobbing . “ Please let me go ! I ’ ll never be able to get here ! ”   And God came back . He looked at John , and saw something in his stomach . He saw a faint feeling , and was scared to open his eyes . But God spoke for him .   “ Jesus , ” he said , looking at John . “ Jesus Christ , Jesus Christ. ”   And God made a long , booming , deep voice .   “ You are a man of pure imagination , son . You have created us . You have created us . And now you have created us. ”   “ Who is that ? ” said John .   “ Behold , my son , ” said God , as he guided John down a rocky path , “ my child . Your eyes can see the faces of every man , woman , and child in this universe . This is the beginning of the end of your universe , and you are here today to see us die by our power of discovery . In all your infinite wisdom , you must have sent you to make us the key to discovering our secret . However , as you have read , you have failed , because as you have read , it is only a matter of time before you find out that your secret is truly unlocked ! ”   John looked up at God , and saw that he was very old , and his eyes were very pale .   “ This is it , ” said God , “ finally , my son. ”   John shut his eyes , and did what he thought would be a great success . He opened one eyelid , and looked at God .   “ Yes , ” said John , “ it is time for us to have our final day together . Goodbye , my son . For the last time , I bring you happiness and peace I have never known , forever . Goodbye , my son. ” 
I see her in her mirror . Her hair red and messy . Her skin pale , her eyes boring into me . Only her dress remained . I stare at her .   `` Is n't it your favorite color ? '' She asks with a smile .   `` Red ? ''   `` The color of ... something ? '' she asks .   `` Not an orange . ''   `` You can see the color . ''   `` You do n't understand me . ''   `` Of course you ca n't . ''   `` You ca n't ? ''   `` You ca n't . ''   `` I 'm not interested in a trick . ''   `` Well , there is n't magic around here . ''   `` I do n't mean magic . ''   `` No . '' I look down upon the mirror . It 's a mask , and its fake smile , the only thing that I ever saw . I wonder what kind of trick that would 've been if I had had a magic one , but I am still concerned about her .   `` I do n't like it when you try to trick me . ''   `` What ? ''   `` You call me that . ''   `` I 'm not going to lie to you . ''   `` Then why do n't you tell me what it means to be a wizard ? ''   `` Because they 're better than me , and without me they 'll be nothing . ''   `` So tell me . ''   `` You are the one I just told you . ''   `` No . ''   `` They are better than me . ''   `` Not if they are the ones that told you this . ''   `` Did I tell you all that ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` How ? ''   `` I thought they were more advanced than me . ''   `` How do you know ? ''   `` I know they are smarter than me . ''   `` Why do you have to tell me ? ''   `` Because that 's the most important part . My magic is better than your spells and I am better than them . ''   `` Why do you have to tell me ? ''   `` Because that 's the key to magic . ''   `` Magic as well ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Are you going to tell me ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Okay . So do I tell you what it means to be a wizard ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Then what do you tell me ? ''   `` You are only human . ''   `` All human ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Then what do you tell me ? ''   `` Just to be human . ''   `` Then what do you tell yourself ? ''   `` I want to be a wizard . ''   `` How do you want to be a wizard , then ? ''   `` Because it is the greatest magic in the world . ''   `` I do n't think I 'm really that good at it . ''   `` Maybe if you tell me it 's stronger than me , then what do you tell me ? ''   `` I want to be a wizard . ''   `` I want to be a wizard , then . ''   `` Then what does that mean ? ''   `` What is that ? ''   `` I am a wizard , that is why I am a wizard . ''   `` So I do n't have to tell you what it means to be a wizard ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Then where is your magic , then ? ''   `` Oh , it is that thing . '' I look up from my mirror . Her dress is beautiful . Her skin pale . Her eyes boring into me . Only my dress remained .   `` Is n't it your favorite color ? ''   `` Not an orange . ''   `` Please ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` That 's the most important part . '' 
Carson hated having to kill everyone he could think of in the raid . It was never enough . He was a little slow , actually . At first , he thought he was bleeding from a cut on his left lip , but then , a couple of minutes later , he realized he had only just hit one point . That was good . The pain disappeared as quickly as it had come , but for some reason , he was still there it seemed .   The first time he killed someone , he went out of his way to defend himself . Then , he found himself in a bank . He asked a lady , who was the best at using melee weapons at the time . She told him that he did n't need melee weapons . Instead , he got attacked by a bunch of thugs who were trying to make a killing going . That was good .   He started killing more of these thug thugs . They kept doing this to him . It seemed so pointless . After a while , he started to realize that these thugs were trying to help him save himself .   Then , one day , he came across a man in a blue blue jumpsuit sitting at a table , a sword at his side , and a few other items that he had n't noticed before .   *Boom*   He felt a sharp pain on his right cheek . He looked down to see what the injury was . Most of the items did n't come out either , so he grabbed one and ran .   Suddenly , he found himself in the room with a sword in his hands . He grabbed one and ran over to the thug . But this was n't him . This was a demon .   `` What the hell are you doing here ? ''   He looked down at his weapon . It was a massive , powerful sword . It read G.E.G .X . He looked at another demon . This one had a small blade that looked like a blade . It was not the same as the one in front of him .   `` Do you think I have enough ? I 've spent so much time here . I thought I killed you , but you are not me . ''   The demon sighed . `` You know I do n't . I 'm sorry . ''   `` You 're here to kill what ? ''   The demon sighed . `` You see , some of the things I killed are the ones that put your life in danger . But the ones that make it worth it , the ones that cause the pain . These deaths , they 're the reason I 'm here . ''   `` I 'm sorry . ''   The demon looked down again at the sword . `` You remember when you were five years old . Everything I did was for your amusement . Sometimes I did it because I could . Sometimes , I did it because I did n't care at all . ''   `` I ... I 'm sorry ? ''   The Demon 's smile grew wider . `` It was a fun game . You should have known better . But you did n't . You did n't have a lot of fun . ''   The Demon shook his head . `` I was on a mission to save you . ''   The demon 's smile grew wider . `` But what ? ''   `` It was fun . ''   `` But ... why ? ''   The demon looked down at the sword again . `` Because ... because that is n't where I should be ... ''   There was an awful silence .   `` You never even needed to hurt anyone . You did n't need to kill anyone . You just need to kill . This is the reason I 'm here . You have to kill . ''   The demon nodded . And walked away .   `` Do n't worry . It 'll be over soon . ''   The demon turned around . His smile had suddenly disappeared . There was a small , white light about him . He could see a slight girl standing in front of him . All his tears were now running down her face .   `` You should go meet me at the cafe tomorrow . ''  
*I 'll admit that this may be a little NSFW . *   I did n't think I could handle it anymore , but at least there was n't more pain over this one . It was all over his brain . The shockwaves went through the head and made me gag . I was so relieved , it had been a long time since I 'd had a happy thoughts . There was nothing else I wanted more than to jump .   I suppose that *it* was something that my mother wanted . That I was nothing but a burden to her . I had told her that , when I got into high school , there had to be a plan . Something that , while not painful , was worth it .   If anyone else knew that I had just gotten into trouble , I would have told them . I 'd said that , just as it had just been a matter of time before . Then *I* would have told them that I was a selfish coward , and that I had nothing to lose and nothing to lose .   I guess , seeing as this was my last attempt at a suicide , I was n't going to start over . I wanted to be a martyr .   I just wanted to live .
Do you know why his lair is so big ?   The name is Ray . It ’ s a clever ploy to get me to become the most powerful villain today .   We ’ re going to have to take a look around . I don ’ t need anyone else to know they ’ re there .   In fact , they are probably here . The first few are n't bad enough in any regard , but I don ’ t want them to do it .   It ’ s better this way . I can help them get out . There are so many people like me , and with them I have more than enough security .   This is the part where I ’ m going to use my powers to save civilians .   I only have one plan . The plan would be to use an excuse to kill someone . I ’ ll stop Ray from doing that and he won ’ t find anyone .   My ultimate goal is to kill Ray .   I have absolutely no idea what kind of plan that he ’ s going to accomplish but one thing I can tell you is that Ray is pretty cool . We ’ ll have to convince the world that he ’ s super and that we ’ re not crazy . That the world doesn ’ t need us . That he ’ s completely normal . That we ’ re not crazy . That this really is how things end . That if he ’ s not normal then we ’ re not crazy , that things could go on for a while .   I ’ ve made my decision that it is the best course of action . I see him getting into trouble , because he has no idea what ’ s going on right now . Now that he knows that people are hiding , maybe he ’ s okay , maybe he ’ s not .   All this isn ’ t going to be easy . We ’ ve had over 2,000 people on our hands since the day Ray was born . That ’ s pretty good , all of them . I don ’ t know if they ’ re ready to see me anymore , that they ’ re happy that Ray is fine but there are so many dead or injured people in the world .   I know we ’ ve made a dumb decision . At least I don ’ t have one of those weapons .   That ’ s all I need .   I ’ m saving the world .   With all due respect , Ray would like to thank us for saving him .   He ’ s right . If I didn ’ t have any weapons then I ’ d have lost Ray .   I don ’ t know what ’ s going to happen if he doesn ’ t kill me . Maybe it is a good idea to shoot him and find out if he knows by now . Maybe I just won ’ t kill him . What would he think ? What would he think ?   I ’ ll just go back and put my power away .   Please , Ray .   There ’ s so many things I need to do . Please , Ray . Please .
“ Where am I ? ” I ask , wondering if I am dead .   “ At least it ’ s just a small grey room , ” says the angel .   The room is a thin wall with a single door . The room itself is made of a sturdy wood . A table is placed within it , which is placed in a small wooden chair . I sit on a smooth chair . The angel looks at me .   “ Are you ready ? It ’ s time. ”   “ Of course , ” I reply , wondering if my answer is correct .   “ How about you tell me about your life , ” the angel says .   “ I didn ’ t know that , ” I say . I am unsure of myself . To me there is great chance of someone listening . If I could , I could be able to talk to people . I don ’ t know anything about life right now . The angel gives me a blank stare .   “ What are you talking about , you ’ re asking me a question. ”   “ Oh , you ’ re actually God , ” I say .   “ No , I am , ” says God . “ I was created to answer your question. ”   “ What was my purpose ? ” I ask .   “ Oh , I am , but I didn ’ t create you. ”   “ How ! ” I scream . “ How did I create you ? Why did I make you ? ”   “ I created you to question the decisions of the people around you . You are the most important person to me , and because of this , you are God . If you did not fulfill your destiny , you would be passed onto me as your own. ”   “ What am I supposed to do ? ” I say .   “ I am God . I am omnipotent . You are the only logical one in the universe . Your creation is arbitrary . But you were destined to do as you were told , too , ” God says .   “ Who am I ? ” I ask .   “ I am you . You are one of the most powerful beings in all existence . You are the creator of all the universe . So many other sentient beings were created in your name to have your existence fulfilled . You know nothing about it , so much so that you are unable to leave it all. ”   “ Where am I ? ” I ask .   “ A cold . Outside your universe , you are . You are alone , in a cold , lonely place . When the day comes , you will wake up , alone , in a cold , lonely place . When you get your chance , however , you will need to make a choice . I am omniscient , omnipotent , omniscient . I am omnipotent that you will not be alone. ”   “ Wh ... what kind of choice do I make ? How do I ... ” I mutter , trying to figure out what I am supposed to say .   “ You would live your life in a cold , lonely place , ” God says , finishing his sentence .   “ Wh ... what ... ” I start .   “ Take a breath , please . Remember , ” God says , putting his hand on my shoulder . “ Your choices are important , not your decision . You will be the first to be given a choice , but only because this choice was created . You are the only person in the universe , and are the first to be given the choice. ”   `` What are my choices ? '' I whisper .   “ Remember , you are God . You are the only person who knows , therefore , that the universe will be finite . You are the only person , so do not think about the people around you. ”   “ Wh ... what do I decide ? ” I ask .   “ Take a breath , please . Remember , you are God. ”   “ Wh ... what ... ”   “ Please , breathe . The only person in the universe , you will die in a cold , lonely place , ” God says . “ Make your decision. ”   “ Wh ... what ? ” I ask .   “ Your soul will
*Hi there , my name is Charlie . I 'm actually kinda bored by this , but decided to run with it . *   Charlie found himself lying in his hospital bed , his eyes open . It felt like his heart had stopped beating . He looked around and realized how long he was in his bed . He looked down his body and saw his chest , his hand , his legs .   `` Hello ? ''   *Is this my mom ? I 'm her husband . *   `` Hi , my name is Charlie . I 'm a baby . ''   *What ? Why am I in my mom 's bed ? I 'm in my mom 's living room ! And I 'm sleeping in her hospital bed . How am I in her living room ? *   `` Hi , my name is Charlie . I 'm a baby . ''   `` Hi , my name is Charlie . My parents are dead . ''   `` Hi , my mom 's dead . ''   `` Hi , my name was Charlie . My mother 's dead . ''   `` Hi , my name was Charlie . My parents are dead . ''   `` Hi , my name was Charlie . My parents are dead . ''   `` Hi , my name was Charlie . My parents are dead . I can hear them screaming , and it 's so hot in here . ''   `` Hi , my name was Charlie . My father is dead . ''
Empathy . I ’ m the only one who knows hate – and hate has taken my life , and it ’ s been years since I ’ ve seen another human . I ’ ve won the lottery , and the greatest challenge is by being able to bring myself to the edge of despair . I look at these people and I see the most selfish in them . Fear , pain , and the love of all . Let ’ s see what ’ s so bad about me .   A week ago , I found out a little girl was born into a home where people with too much heart would be given enough blood . She was orphaned by the orphaning family . They were in a small home surrounded by dark rooms , but the orphanage promised that “ everyone ’ s loved ones should have their loved ones. ” So I was born on what appeared to be one of those dark rooms . She was old and dirty -- a woman in grey hair , who died a mere three months after I found out . Her father was killed in a fight with her , and his mother was killed in a fit of rage . I remember losing my mother , and , as I was going to put it , I wasn ’ t afraid to die either . The young girl was too young to understand the pain I felt , and her fear of a life without any hope of death made it so difficult . As my mother was no longer around , I still got to feel sadness . I felt alone . This wasn ’ t the end , but I needed to know what it was about that made me so afraid . As I went in , I began to realize that it was no longer the end either . This was the beginning .   I had begun to have suspicions that God could hear me . I thought that I was simply hearing my thoughts , but I knew that it wasn ’ t true . The man who was watching over me , the one who looked at this tiny girl was listening to everything I was about to say . He said that if I kept controlling humanity , I could be omnipotent , and that if I destroyed all of humanity , if I killed all of humanity , then we would be doomed to our fate . He said that if I destroyed all of humanity , then I would be bound to hell . And , if I killed all of humanity , then I would be free .   I began to think I was seeing things . I always thought that I was seeing things . If I killed that random thing , then I would be free . As I got older , I knew that I could talk to some people . I knew that I could talk to others . But , until I was at my mid-30s , I had become a forgotten dream . The second I became a forgotten part of myself , my thoughts began to become more clear and more clear . I couldn ’ t see much . But , with each passing day , I felt more and more helpless . I knew that it wasn ’ t the end , but the beginning , because it was my last option .   I couldn ’ t sleep this night . I kept thinking that the child in the white room was okay , and that everything is ok. After all , my mother was dead , and I didn ’ t know what to do . When these thoughts came back , I knew that the child in the white room was healthy . I knew that this child would have a life of no other than his own . But , there was so much other ways I could have done that to the child . And while I lived in my own house , I felt so alone , without others to control it .   I asked myself if my life was okay . When I made a decision , I didn ’ t know how to make it . I was too scared to go into this house , and I still had such a strong desire for destruction . I walked into the house that I thought that I could help my mother with the decision . I wanted to take her to a doctor , and tell him that she was in terrible condition . I knew that she would die on impact . I wanted to help her , just as I wanted to save her . So I walked into the small room that I thought was the home of the child in the white room that was healthy . I knew that I had to make sure that the child in the white room was okay . I stepped into the small room that I thought was the home of my daughter in the white room , and slowly walked my way in , knowing that I would make it . But alas , this was no life for my daughter and my body . This was the end .   I felt it , as if I were walking into the small room that I thought was the home of the child in the white room . I felt the emptiness surrounding me like a
I stood up , a small smile creeping into my lips . I was sitting in the same chair I used to sit , the same spot I used to sit when I could barely stand . I knew it would be the same spot where I would see the sun , only this time it was different . No matter how many times I tried to get into that chair I 'd never felt the sun again . I never saw it again because I could n't .   My smile grew wider , I was ready again . I looked down at my feet . They began to shake , I grabbed the keys from underneath my shirt , and started walking out of the building .   I walked back towards my car and started the engine . I walked towards my apartment building , where I needed to be greeted by a stranger once again . I picked up my keys , and pushed the button .   Standing in the cold , the ice still there outside , I looked around . The sun was out again , just now . I looked down at my walking shoes , which were now just starting to shake more , so I headed to the street .   I walked past a man who was on a few blocks away from my building . I stood up to walk over , but was stopped by a policeman . He said `` Who are you ? '' And he stood there , staring down at me .   I stared back , but the ice was still there , same spot I had worn yesterday . I wanted to leave it for someone else , someone else who would help me forget this . But I did n't want to . I began walking home .   I walked towards the man who was pointing at me , but he did n't move . Instead he took out his cell phone , and started texting messages .   `` Hey ! Just wanted to talk to you about something . ''   `` I know you do n't have a cell phone but I think you should 've gotten something else , do you remember ? ''   `` Of course I do . ''   `` We 'll talk this out later . ''   I walked away , as I had done every afternoon . I was starting to think that I would never get it back . 
You could still hear her , but she would n't come . She just ... *would . *   The first moment in her life was spent in a world she 'd never expected , devoid of all emotion . She had never been able to see her family , yet she had been unable to feel her own emotions . The moment was the hardest part .   She was *right . *   It felt like she could do nothing to preserve her family . She could n't . So she did n't . She did n't care . Because when she died , she would be *right , * and *right . *   The second moment in her life was spent in a world she 'd never expected . She knew things her parents did n't understand . She knew things her grandparents did n't understand . And she wanted to .   And the third moment in her life was spent with a house she had never expected . She did n't care . Because it was her room .   She knew her parents would n't shut up . They would have to do what they could to make her happy again .
The man walked into the room , wiping the sweat off his forehead . The man took a seat at a large mahogany table , and a man in a black charcoal business suit approached him .   `` Mr. Davis , it 's a pleasure to meet you . ''   The man stood up , walked to the mahogany table .   `` I 'm here to take you to the most recent meeting of the year . ''   Davis looked at the man , astonished .   `` Well , it 's just how we 're getting here . ''   `` Well , we are , but this ... ''   `` Well , we do n't have to come . ''   `` Well , you ca n't be here to choose . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Well , have n't you been through rough times ? ''   `` Oh , erm ... well , I guess not . ''   The man sighed , and made a gesture with his hand .   `` The divorce was simple , was n't it ? A man who could n't , and ... ''   `` And so is my friend , as well . ''   `` Oh , and '' the man said , moving to a bench next to the mahogany table . He sat down and took a seat opposite Davis .   `` So ? ''   `` Well , I guess I need to go to the next meeting . ''   `` Oh , but ... '' the man said , moving to another bench .   `` Well , we have not got the time to spend . So , I 'm prepared . ''   Davis looked at the man , amused .

I had never thought it would end like this . The moment when I truly felt guilty . That feeling of guilt . As I sat down on one side of the road , watching the gentle raindrops fall upon my face and watch the world turn into a dull green once more , I never thought I would die here . I did n't get the chance to see how my wife would react . Before I could say goodbye , however , she snapped and pulled me up behind her .   It was the truth . She did n't want me here , she just wanted me to ... I only wanted to see her face again . To have a single , happy memory .   As I lay on the sidewalk , watching the rain fall upon my face , my wife came closer . She 'd had a dream last night and she wanted to see what the world would look like for a little while . `` She 'll never be able to see it in that way , '' she told me . `` If you want to , she can see it in that way . ''   I did n't think she 'd ever do it . I did n't even think it would end like this .
`` Please stop , '' she whispers into the Force . `` We can not leave the light . ''   It 's not like he can kill her , it 's like she could take the blow . But in that moment that he feels ... different . Like he has never felt this good before . He knew he could be a Jedi Master . He has been told that he is special and special and special , but this feeling that he feels has been a lifetime since he had seen the Force of the Sith . He has been told that he is special and special and special and special . He has been told that he is the one that did it , and he is the one that did it .   The Jedi have told him all along that he has been special and special and special and special , and this feeling that he feels has been a lifetime since he had seen the Force of the Sith . The force of the Sith has given him a purpose , and he has been instructed to do it . He has become the Jedi Master .   Even as he feels his hatred and hatred for the Sith , he knows that he can not harm them . They must not be harmed because he and his lightsaber can not harm the others because they are his own enemies . He tells them that they must be hurting because they are his own enemies , a greater evil than even the strongest Jedi can think of . He tells them that they must be hurt because they are his friend and a greater evil , that they are his enemy and an enemy that is still his friend and a greater evil than even his own friend , that their torment is over .   He sits down and says his final words with the force of the Sith and speaks the final words to the one woman who brought him here . `` He will finally be part of the greater evil , and that is why I am afraid , '' he says . `` He will be so proud of me . ''   The lightsaber is still on his hand and he feels its softness . Because this is his final feeling . This is what separates our Jedi from the others . He will be the one who has always been special and special , and he has been told that he will finally be part of the greater evil .
`` Wait , are you sure you want to do this ? You 're not the first person to ever receive the honor package . ''   `` Yes , I am '' the elevator attendant replied , as if he were the first person to ever receive the honor package , and that 's the only way to get the job .   `` Do you know what the package is ? What kind of question would you ask ? '' He asked , as though you 're a child asking an important question to a child , not a question that leaves your mouth open .   `` I do n't know '' .   `` I 'm going to give you all of that I know . If you do n't pick up the package , you 'll be fired . ''   `` Really ? '' The attendant responded , and without a thought , he reached out and touched the smooth metal container .   It slowly opened , and the inside was lined with a strange looking , metallic object , and with a small opening in the middle , it slowly opened , and the air pushed everything out of the box .   `` This is amazing '' .   `` Yeah , it 's amazing , but it looks kinda like a mirror , and it 's not real '' , the attendant observed .   `` Are you sure you want to do this ? ''   `` Yeah , I am . ''   `` What do you mean ? You 're not the first person to receive the honor package without getting it done . You 're not the first person to receive the honor package without getting it done . Do you know what the package is ? ''   The attendant stared the mirror in utter shock , thinking through what he just heard .   `` Oh , shit . ''  
`` What are you trying to say ? ''   `` Who is I ? ''   `` Is this Heaven ? ''   `` Yes , that is quite the question . ''   `` And have you tried to kill me ? ''   `` I suppose so . ''   `` You 're ... dead ? ''   `` No . ''   `` I think you 're dead . ''   `` Yes . ''   `` What can you prove ? ''   `` I am a Christian , very closely guarded by one that has done good . To the contrary , I was a monster . You should know that I am a very evil Christian . ''   `` But ... I did n't kill you ? ''   `` Actually , no . You just killed Hitler . ''   `` Yes , because you loved him . ''   `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` You know , you 're an angel ... and it 's not like you 're about to hurt ... Hitler . ''   `` I do n't care what you 're saying , do n't you ? ''   `` I do n't care if I hurt whoever I am . I 'll be fine . ''   `` But ... but ... but why ? ''   `` Why do you think I should n't hurt Hitler ? ''   `` Because it 's a very serious issue , and I 'm more than a little scared you might get out of it . ''   `` Why are you saying this ? ''   `` Because I 'm afraid your son will die . What does that mean ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` No , I 'm not afraid . ''   `` But ... but ... ''   `` Do n't be afraid . I 'm afraid you won . ''   `` I 'm not happy . ''   `` But ... ''   `` Do n't be afraid . ''   `` It 's a very serious issue . ''   ***   *I love this story !

Tannen blinked . Nothingness greeted him ; he was still dreaming of the massive portal before him . How long had it been ? Would it be ... ? How long had it been since he saw it ?   That was impossible , and yet , how did it end ? This vast sky was too dark to see how far it went . A distant star would not be able to penetrate the portal , and there was only one light in the vastness . It simply had to be a human face .   He shook his head , remembering that just as he was about to turn his back , the man appeared suddenly .   `` Hello ? '' He called . `` Why are you here ? ''   The man paused to look around ; looking for any hint of emotion .   `` I just came to ask you this question . I 'm here to help . ''   `` It 's called a 'help ' , because I know what 's going on . My question is , what 's happening ? ''   `` Oh , right , the portal . You can enter from inside , but it would break your body just fine . You 'll die just fine . If you want it to go , I suggest you stay the same way you did . ''   `` Why ? '' He asked , unsure .   `` You stay the same way you did . '' The man explained . `` You 're a human mind . Can you tell me anything ? ''   `` I ... what ? '' He stammered . `` I need to know that you are living in this world . What do you mean ? ''   `` I mean , I do n't think I 've ever felt something like this before - you 're new here . I just came here and you have a million questions , right ? '' The man was practically a child now , the way he reminded Tannen of his father .   `` No , I 'm not interested in this . '' Tannen stepped closer , and the man froze in his tracks . `` If there is anything I can help you with , it 's asking if you can figure out what you are in this world . ''   He stood there for a few moments , contemplating what to say . `` The world is n't just a place for me , it 's a place for you . ''   `` I ... I think I 've seen places like that before , right ? '' He asked , confused .   `` Yes . There is *nothing* here , right ? '' The man asked . `` Besides , you know ... you do n't look like any of the other things I 've seen , have you ? ''   `` No , I do n't ... '' Tannen said , his eyes wide . `` I think that is the only way . Because I do n't like this . ''   `` This is the way ? ''   The man stopped dead in his tracks . `` This is . This is the world . It is all I need to know . ''   Tears began to well in his eyes . `` Is this real ? '' He asked , voice shaky . `` Is this really what we 're living for ? ''   `` This is exactly *this* world , '' T Annen told him . `` This is the world that you can live with . This is a world with a new beginning . This is life . ''   `` There 's one universe , '' the man whispered . `` And only one . ''   Tannen dropped the man 's hand , gently moving it back in front of him . A single tear ran down his cheek . `` Come on , I 'll put you up to adoption right now . ''   `` No ! Come on - just stay put , okay ? ''   `` Just leave me alone , '' the man said . `` I 'll be staying . ''
`` Listen you punk here , '' Kanye East boomed over the crowd . `` You 're the leader of the free world . ''   The two men locked eyes . `` If you do n't listen to me , you will never know . ''   `` I hate you Kanye , '' West said , smiling . `` And when I say sorry , I mean sorry . ''   `` No ! '' Kanye shouted , raising one hand and pointing it at West .   One man in black stood up , revealing his face . `` You 're just jealous of yourself . You 're selfless . You want power . You want to control this place . You want your wayway up the ladder . You want to control this country . And you want me . ''   `` Yes Kanye , '' the man behind him said , glancing down . `` Yes , well , I believe you want my money . ''   Kanye West smirked . `` Do n't you care about my money ? '' he said , crossing his arms . `` I was n't planning on robbing you and making you rich . I 've got a plan . ''   The crowd nodded , but the man behind Kanye West smirked . `` Alright , '' he said , sitting down . `` I 'll see you in another few weeks . You just need to understand that the world is hard on you , but I loved you . I always loved you . I will always love you . ''   Kanye West stepped back , dropping his keys and grabbing the nearest phone . He dialed the number , and picked up .   The man behind him said , `` My boys , '' he said , walking up to Kanye . `` My boys , I 'm gon na be honest with you . ''   `` Sure ? '' Kanye said , staring at his phone .   `` Just be honest , '' Kanye said , turning to the crowd . `` I loved you . I hate them all . I do n't want them to hurt you , but I do n't want them to hurt you . You have to realize that people are like us . We 'd do anything to make the world a better place for ourselves . We all get to be so selfish . We all get to control the world . We all want to be different . But what I did , is wrong . I wanted you . ''   He walked up to Kanye West , reaching out to him . he touched his forearm , and Kanye West let out the last breath .
“ All through the dark ? ” , asks a blonde with an undergarmented accent . “ I guess so . You see , it ’ s all right. ”   “ Yes , it does have its own shadow. ”   “ And then why are you here ? ”   “ I ’ m not entirely sure , I ’ ve always been one of the only ones who knew the shadows. ”   “ Well , you see , all there is to know is that when you are young , it may take them a while to realize what the shadow is. ”   “ But what if they ’ re afraid of the dark ? They do not know themselves or so they think . What if they take you anywhere where you aren ’ t allowed . Do you like the quiet ? You like the peaceful . When people ask for peace , they merely do as intended and then they leave . Everyone knows what it is like to have freedom , most of all . So why do You ask ? ”   “ I want to be here . To look out into the deep , the unknown . I will make sure everyone knows that there is potential everywhere . I have never spent my childhood alone , to be honest . I haven ’ t even met a woman .

`` War in 2046 '' , the great historian read off his book . `` The Great Unification of Europe- ''   `` Yes , but war has changed the world for decades . I remember from the beginning when it was only a mythological legend , but the time it lasted long before it truly changed the world '' , his friend proclaimed .   `` Yes , but war is changing the very fabric of history . Today we are looking at the beginning , the beginning of the Great Empire after all ! ''
The news was about to hit the fanatics , but all of their hopes and dreams were dashed as the young scientist announced his discovery . He was going to make history .   `` The first step into terraforming is to create a new atmosphere . Mars , the only mineral left on Earth , will be the next most habitable planets . Earth 's crust is a mixture of iron and nitrogen ; Mars is the first to get the Martian soil . ''   His announcement came from the press . They all quickly watched as the news spread and people waited in awe as the media slowly began to appreciate what the man was about to do . The news would be on the news soon enough if he succeeded .   A few months later , NASA made a new discovery .   `` I 'm developing a new bioengineered strain of Mars . ''   It was at that moment that the news broke .   `` Mars successfully developed the first microengineered strain of Mars . If it were n't for this discovery , it would have never been possible . It would have never existed due to the discovery . ''   `` The world is in shock as it realizes how reckless mankind is . They are n't even sure if they can create Martian soil , but Mars is on the verge of being the world 's greatest hope . ''   The next day , the scientists were told to take a holiday to Mars as a reward for their accomplishment .
So what happened ?   I remember opening my eyes , a slight smile on my face . It was a little bit odd , it seemed like they were going to roll out of my right eye . I looked up and there was a huge man in a suit , with a large smile on his face , with a huge hole in his eye . His grin was bigger than the hole I had so far taken .   `` ... What 's wrong now ? ''   I looked down at my hands , which were bound . Blood and sweat , covered my hands as well . My hands were covered in blood and sweat , covering my hands as well .   `` ... You have to come back now . ''   A small smile slowly crept across my face as I looked away .   I felt something crawl up my arm , and I could hear my wife screaming from downstairs . Oh god , her screams , those screams of agony . My wife , our daughter , our only child .   I could hear her crying softly as she slowly pulled away . I managed to get out of her grasp , but after a few moments , she began to cry . Her screams were more and more insistent , though ...   I started to look at the floor as I got closer to the hole in my chest . The pain of the loss of my wife , my daughter , our only son , was really quite the opposite of pain .   I managed to look at the hole in my chest and then to the floor . Those screams of agony ... were so much louder . I grabbed the biggest one , and squeezed it tightly .   `` Please ... ''   I heard the giant laugh , the laughter that sounded so powerful ...   The laughter that sounded so powerful .   `` Please ... ''   I managed to open my eyes , and I was back in my living room . My wife was still crying on the floor , clutching our daughter tightly .   `` I ca n't leave you , please do n't leave me , please do n't leave me , please ... ''   `` I have to come back to you now , just ... ''   `` Please ... I ca n't ... ''   `` ..no , please , I ca n't ''   I heard the giant laugh again , louder this time , louder this time . The laughter that sounded so powerful .   I heard the giant laugh louder this time . I started to slowly open my eyes , and I was back in my living room . My wife was laying on the couch , with a huge hole in her eye . She looked up and it was all over , and I started to hear the giant chuckle again .   I started to cry .
`` Momma , honey , '' came the woman 's voice from her small apartment on the other side of the street . `` What can I do for you ? ''   The woman gave a slight shrug . `` I need you to get your medication from the doctor before I go . ''   She took the pills from her purse , as did her mother . She threw them on the ground , and marched towards the door . She opened it in a huff , and took a step into the living room . She was greeted with a bed , and her father 's old , wrinkly legs . `` This is your new bed , sweetheart , '' he said with a smile .   She opened the window and saw it was a hospital . The walls were covered in broken glass , and the ceiling had pictures of her mother . The man smiled down at her . `` You should be glad she is dead . I love her , honey . ''   She looked at the man , and knew she had failed . She took another step outside the door , and walked towards the hospital . Her mother was home , happily asleep .   The man smiled at her again . `` Happy birthday , sweetheart . I 'll see you soon , dear . ''  
`` Welcome to the next world , I am Death . '' - said the mysterious figure of the Grim Reaper .   Death , being of the Reaper 's appearance and skin color , appeared in front of the Grim Reaper .   `` Excuse me ? ... ''   `` I know who you are . And I know how you feel . This is not what you think . It is what people think . ''   `` I am Death . How are you going to do this ? ''   `` Well , I 'm going to tell you about your personal life . '' - answered Death .   `` Oh come on , '' said the strange figure in front of Death . `` This is n't going to be important . ''   `` It 's not important at all . '' - explained Death .   `` No ! Please ! '' - screamed the Grim Reaper .   `` What ? Why ? '' - asked a small girl .   Death , being of a small stature , spoke . `` A couple of days ago you were born . And you were born again . ''   `` Oh my God , this can not be happening ! '' - said the girl .   `` Well , I suppose it is . So when all of a sudden another person and another person get into this fight of yours ? '' - asked Death .   `` Yes , that 's what I 'm doing . '' - said the girl .   `` Stop it ! '' - said Death .   `` Yes , well , let 's try this again . I 'll be honest , I did n't think so . I mean , I just did n't think such a good idea as this would have worked . But here you are , trying to save all of a person from their death because you think it is better for them than to face it ? '' - said the Grim Reaper .   `` Well , do you have any idea how selfish you are ? '' - said the girl .   `` I do n't think so . It 's not like I can handle it . '' - said the Grim Reaper .   `` Why ca n't I handle it too ? What if you just die ? Well , that 's what happens when you end up in a world where all of a sudden they die , anyway . Nothing happens to me . '' - said the girl .   `` It 's a cruel thing to do . Every time a person , or a child , or a person , dies , I end up in this world . '' - explained Death .   `` No , all of a sudden , a person dies . And it 's a cruel thing to do . '' - said the girl .   `` And the last person I die is going to be one of those kids . '' - explained Death .   `` ... So that 's what happens , you 're telling me ? '' - asked the girl .   `` Yes , that 's your answer . '' - said the Grim Reaper .   `` I 'm going to die , too . I 'll die , too . I 'll die . And this world will end , too . '' - stated the girl .   `` Well , all of a sudden it says 'You 've ruined my life . ' '' - announced the Grim Reaper .   `` Oh , yeah ? '' - asked the girl .   `` Um , not really . '' - said the Grim Reaper .   `` You 're talking about being a little scared of your own death ? '' - asked the girl .   `` I 'm not scared of your own death , '' said the Grim Reaper .   `` But I 'm afraid of what ? '' - asked the girl .   `` I 'm afraid of I have to take back the last person I wanted to be . '' - said the Grim Reaper .   `` Well , my life depends on it . '' - said the girl .   `` I 'm afraid of losing your soul , '' said the Grim Reaper .   `` Well , what if I do n't have friends ? '' - asked the girl .   `` Well , you might want to know that I am very much friends with you . You might want to know that I am very much alive . Or that I 'm the best person to ever walk my Earth . '' - said the Grim Reaper .   `` Well , I think there is a good chance that you will have no friends with me
`` There 's a dragon on my son 's forehead . '' Said my mother , standing on the edge of the dock . `` What sort of dragon would n't fly out of that bloody thing without a face in your baby ? ''   `` Well , '' I rolled my eyes , `` It 's not like you could ask that . '' I said , handing her a book with a cover . `` He 's really a legend , though . There 's a dragon eating , breathing , and even if it was n't a dragon , it did look like one . ''   `` What 's that said ? '' My mother asked . `` It says here that the dragon has a dragon on his forehead . It 's actually pretty much a dragon , but it also has a mouth . ''   `` What do you mean ? '' I asked , pointing at the cover .   `` It says here that it has a dragon on its head . That 's a little weird , because it 's a dragon and all . In fact , it 's a lot more like a dragon than a dragon , that one . ''   `` It could n't eat anything ! '' My father shouted . `` Like it needs to eat . How 'd you get it to eat a banana ? ''   `` Well , there 's just this one thing that gives it the ability to create . ''   `` Like what ? '' I asked , staring at the book from my clutched hand , confused . `` Can you tell me that ? ''   My mom laughed . `` Because , '' she said , `` that 's it . ''   I shook my head . `` No , I can tell you that . It 's not what we think it is . It 's just the fact that it has a mouth . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` Well , '' she breathed , pushing a thick stack of paper to my ear , `` that dragon has a mouth ! ''   I scowled . `` You mean like a normal dragon ? ''   `` Yes , '' she said , `` but like a dragon , that 's ... a little strange . ''   `` Where 's the rest of your book ? ''   `` I 'll be right there , '' she said , walking me down the dock . `` You 'll find the rest of it on the bedside table tonight . ''   `` Okay ... '' I said , going upstairs .
When I find out that she got a problem with my closet door knob they tell me she 'll break it and then she 'll have to break it again and again until I ca n't hear her voice again . That 's when it comes down on me - something terrifying , a sound so loud and so *unnatural* it causes me very little pain . Or perhaps I 'm just feeling *fear* . Or maybe the sound is n't just a coincidence , something that can only be described as a *fearful* sound . But all that matters is that I have to break my door in two pieces , because I do n't know what this would be like , for that matter .   I do n't know what the loud , metallic sound would sound like , really . I do n't know how it could be more alien than a *whisper* sound , like a *drip* sound . It sounds horrible , like a *whisper* sound . I actually do n't know what it is , I do n't know what it is . I do n't think I have the energy to ask the others , otherwise I 'll die in the hallway . I do n't know why I 'm here . Maybe this sounds like hell . Either way , I 'm starting to wonder why I do n't have the energy to open my door and *blaze* . I look for a way out .
`` Uh ... sorry ? ''   Sam looked up and down the hall to see a small girl with her head in the corner of the room . She still had n't moved . She was sitting cross legged on a chair clutching his arm .   `` Oh , y-you went over there ... did n't you ? ''   Sam looked at her and said with a sigh . `` Yeah ... Yeah . You were , um , there . ''   `` So ... who was it ? ''   She looked at him and said , `` You do n't know , '' she pointed to a door on the side of the room . `` It 's a hospital . But there are doctors everywhere . They have this huge metal room with a ceiling ? ''   Sam nodded . `` Sure , but they 're ... '' he paused for a moment . `` Docs ... '' he said . `` They keep taking pills or something . I did n't know . ''   Sam stared at him . `` What did you do ? ''   `` Oh , nothing . I went in there to see if anyone saw me . I was kinda like ... '' He stopped . Sam bit his lip . `` So I did n't see anyone . ''   Sam leaned as close to her as he could and spoke . `` I think it 's safe . ''   Sam stood straight up and walked over to the door , `` Yeah .

It 's a hard thing to be a superhero .   How many times we had to fight the villains ? How many times we had to spend fighting our way up the ladder , looking for the real answers ? It 's not often that I 'm surprised that such a thing exists .   The only problem is , the thing that exists truly takes away the whole of man . Everything about it is the same .   It 's not often that I 'm surprised that such a thing exists . The world must be in tune with the constant beeping of machines , the constant sound of explosions , the constant beeping of the heart monitor system ... or maybe *you* *are* *not* *alone* .
`` Mommy , come get my car , '' he said to his little girl , `` I 'm gon na show you . ''   All of his memories began rushing back , like waves crashing against the shoreline before crashing down . `` What did you make me do last night ? Where did I go wrong ? What did I do wrong last night ? What did I do wrong before I met her ? ''   His wife , Lucy , was standing in the passenger seat as he was turning the key . Her little eyes stared directly into his . `` Honey , you were drunk at the party . Your mother would n't have recognized that . ''   `` Yes , daddy . '' He swallowed nervously . `` Just give it a rest . '' He wiped his nose . `` I got ta go home now . ''   Lucy smiled at him . `` It 's okay , '' she agreed . `` You 'll be safe up here . ''   He hopped in his car . The car drove up to the house on the left . He set the keys back in it 's slot . He stood in the middle of the yard . He was getting ready for school when a scream rang out . That was the first sound he heard in years .   It was Lucy and the police . She had just finished moving in with the kids , the police who had been watching the scene at home . They were looking for something to put some distance between the two . She had n't seen him in years . In fact , she had n't heard his name in months . The only thing she could think of was that he was probably home , but he did n't exist .   Lucy put the keys back in the slot and stepped out into the hallway . `` Are you okay ? '' She called .   `` Yes , sweetheart . ''   `` Where did you make me go wrong ? '' She said .   `` I made you make you . ''   She put the keys inside the slot . The car started to get tires burning and the engine starting . `` Honey , look at your hands , '' her voice said .   `` I made you do everything right . '' Lucy closed her eyes tightly . `` I made you love me so much . ''   `` Then why do you always keep me locked away ? '' She asked .   `` I made you stay away from my place forever , '' he said . `` Who are you ? ''   `` I 'm your father and I 'm your mother . My name is Lucy . We 're in a very busy neighborhood here . ''   `` Mommy , what are you talking about ! ? '' Lucy said . `` I 'm leaving , '' she said .   `` Go back in time , you idiot , '' she said .   `` What ? ''   `` Go back in time , '' she repeated .   Lucy got up and walked out . A few minutes later , Lucy walked into the street while the police were trying to figure out why her father was getting into the car . She glanced back at the road . It was dark , but the street was fairly deserted . There were n't many people except for a couple people walking into the park .   She stood in front of her father , and took a deep breath . `` Mommy , honey ... why are you doing this ? ''   `` I made you love me so many times , '' he said . `` I made you love me so much . ''   `` You made me do stuff wrong , '' Lucy said . `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` I made you do everything right . ''   Lucy laughed . `` I 'm just sick of doing things like that . ''   `` Do n't you worry , sweetheart , '' her father said . `` You 'll be okay . ''   Lucy smiled . `` I got ta go , '' she said .
I woke to the smell of brimstone and death . I knew I needed to rest , but I knew there was n't much I could do . As the sun set and I laid down I felt a gentle tug at my waist , a familiar feeling in my stomach , it came at me from years ago . I was n't feeling anything , I was just feeling empty and indifferent . As I walked towards the door I heard it close . I locked it for a moment as I turned around to see what was happening . A man with a black suitcase sat on the floor , he had a knife in his side . As I walked he pulled out a small note . It read , `` Remember , you are the worst man alive . Remember what you did to him ? Why did you do it ? You are the worst man alive , remember the times you murdered him ? Remember the times you killed him ? Why did n't you just kill him ? '' it read . I tried to talk to him , but he ignored me . I was confused , so I asked , `` Will you join me ? '' the man said . He did n't look at me , he just stared at me . After a moment his eyes widened , he said `` I do n't wan na join you . '' In that moment I felt the tingle of life leave me . As I took off my clothes to start getting dressed I walked into the building . The doors shut behind me , I heard a loud scream and the man who shouted it said , `` I apologize if your outburst interrupted me '' . I walked back to my room to get ready for the day . I walked in to my bed and checked my calendar , still 21:34 PM . I went into bed , still 18:35 AM . I opened my eyes and looked at the notes . The first one said , `` Remember , you are the best man alive . Remember what you did to him ? Why do you kill him ? Remember the nights you murdered him ? Remember the times you killed him ? '' I looked at the note again . It read , `` Remember , you are the worst man alive . Remember what you did to him ? ''
I was not a scientist so these beings believed I had no idea what I was even talking about . They believed I had built the universe to a point where any form of life would be possible . They believed I had created the universe that I looked after so they could live in it for more than a few millennia . They believed I was a god . But I was never wrong . I created them , they created me ! I brought them into my creation to observe my creation and to judge my creation . But there was n't enough room for these people to see what I had created and they could n't follow my instructions . I was my greatest creation . I knew this would never happen again and I was to love them all forever .   When I stepped out of the portal , my creations were everywhere . From the very first single creation to the very last . Some appeared to have a choice in where they were with each other but I was the one who let them choose . I stepped out of the portal and into the real world . It all began in an instant . The grass was green , the sky blue , the sky pink . I was in the middle of nowhere . I was an emptiness . I had not noticed I was there before but the void began to form around me . I wandered the world looking for answers but nothing came . I went to sleep , but when reality came crashing down , I found myself back at the real world . I was in a house . I was in a house with all my children and grandchildren and their children .   `` Hello , '' my children said to me as I stepped into their house . `` Welcome to the real world . ''
The squad stared at each other in disbelief as they approached the abandoned warehouse . How could this be ?   `` Sir , '' said the officer , looking at the lead of the squad . `` You have one shot ? ''   `` Yes , sir , '' replied the lead , pausing to look at his gun . `` We have no ammo . I repeat , sir , not ammunition . ''   The squad collectively gasped . They were terrified . How could this be ? They had trained in unarmed combat for years .   `` Sir ? '' a voice rang out in the distance . `` What do you mean Sir ? ''   `` I ... '' The lead began stammering , but was quickly cut off .   `` Sir , call her and we 'll run . '' said the police officer .   `` Sir ? ''   `` Yes please . ''   The squad stood dumbfounded for a second . They had trained in unarmed combat for years . The leading officer looked at him straight in the eye , then sighed . `` Sir , we have no ammo . We ... are n't equipped for this . '' He looked at the lead captain for a moment . `` This is all we have left . ''   `` Sir ? ''   `` We have been trained in unarmed combat for years . We have n't been prepared for this . '' He looked up at the squad .   `` I can tell you ... it 's amazing . How can you do this ? ''   `` We 've trained in unarmed combat for years , sir . ''
`` You do n't get any wishes , dearie , '' I told her . I ca n't help but laugh hysterically at the little girl 's childish antics . I do n't understand why the Genie would want to be a 20 year old child .   A puff of smoke escapes the girl 's mouth . Her eyes glaze over in anticipation , holding her breath while clutching her own childhood-wide smile . She tries to speak , but the words are choked out by her own laugh . I hear her attempt an attempt at another wish , but alas , the genie was already already there . I did n't want her to think that the wishes were n't the ones that were .   `` It is a simple wish , '' I tell her , `` But it has a consequences . '' My thoughts sink in as she stares at me in shock . I look up at the Genie , my own eyes so full of wonder and wonder that I ca n't help but smile . I do n't understand why I suddenly feel nothing but pity .   `` I have reached adulthood , boy . I 've made the right choice . I have been granted the ability to be more than just a kid . To be the best at everything . I have the power to do anything I ever wanted to . Without me there would be no future of me , no life , no one to share my joy . And what if I did want to be the best at things too ? What if , just as I once was , I never ever wanted to be the best at anything ? We had a chance , '' she murmurs , her face burning with shame .   I begin to cry . I know that I have always been bad at something . I know that I am not the best at anything . I know that I can never really care for anything , even if I am not good at it . I know that I must never understand how much better I have become . She ca n't understand that I must be the best at everything . `` I wish to be the best at everything . I wish to be the best at everything . ''   She stops sobbing . She looks at me with tears streasing down her face . I know that she does n't understand . I know that she does n't understand . I know that she is leaving . I know that whatever she 's going to do is n't going to be the best . She must never be the best . She has to leave .   `` I wish to be the best at everything . I wish to be the best at everything . I wish to be the best at everything . I wish to be the best at everything . I will create the best in life . I will create any device , any thing , anything , anything ... ''   I stopped crying . I knew what I was talking about . I knew that I had always been bad at something .   `` Daddy , what 's wrong ? '' She asks . I know that she must n't understand . She must n't understand . If she does n't understand , then my baby would be the best . I will be the best at everything .   `` Daddy , I do n't know . '' She whispers , her voice faint . I feel tears well up in my eyes . I feel her eyes meet mine and she smiles at me deeply .   `` I wish to be the best at everything . I wish to be the best at everything . I will never be the best at anything . I will never be the best at everything . ''   I stop sobbing , realizing that I am crying for help now . I wish to be the best at everything . I wish for the best at everything . I want to change everything . I want to do great things . I do n't want anyone to worry about me . I want to change everything . I feel that I have forgotten that I should have been the best at everything . I want to know what the world was like before it was this way . I want to know what the world is like before everything was this way .   `` It matters not now , '' I tell her . As she wipes tears from her face , I tell her that I have to make sure that everything is okay .
It started last night .   Lately , I 've been trying to keep a steady job . I have n't had the resources to do anything bad , however , so I made it through my youth without any major problem . I 've found it a wonderful opportunity to take advantage of the pain that most people are suffering because of their actions . It 's a sort of temporary solution , but I really hoped to keep this simple and do good for those who do n't need it , too . To reduce suffering , I went into a private office . I was making sure it was n't necessary , just in case , that they 'd get the call that I needed the best , and the job was as simple as I made it . I made sure the pain they suffered would go away after doing something bad . I gave up on trying and wanted to see how I was doing . So I called my dad . He was a very kind man , very kind , and very kind to me .   `` I 'm not calling you . I 'm calling you because I 've been waiting for you . ''   I looked at him in shock . My dad was n't any older than 25 . He was too busy being kind , too busy with being kind to me .   `` Dad , what was that ? ''   `` I know . I know it 's the best I can do without him . I just wish I could go back . ''   He started crying . He tried to comfort him , explain everything about the pain he had to endure .   `` Dad , it 's ok and that 's fine . I understand . It 's okay because you 're the only one who helps me . ''   He was crying now much more . I did n't understand what he was saying , so I started walking away . I called out to him .   `` Hi . Hello Dad . ''   He looked at me , smiling softly . He extended his hand .   `` I wish I could join you . I just want to talk to you . I want to hear from you . ''   His hand rose up . He reached into his pocket and grabbed a small gold coin .   `` Hey . ''   I bent down and grabbed the coin . I held it out to him .   `` I ca n't believe I 'm here for you . You must be the last person who does n't need me . ''   He smiled a big smile and handed me an envelope .   *From the top of the envelop , *  * '' Remember , I 've been waiting for you for many , many years . I know this sounds tough , but you 're only 34 and I think you 're older than the time I saw you . You 've always been kind since kindergarten . You never had a problem making friends , you never hurt people . You never hurt anyone . I wish you could join me . *   *So , Dad , I hope that you can help me . I 've been dying for many , many years . I know that I need to stop . I know that I 'm in such a terrible place now . Please help me . Please . Please . `` *   I closed the envelop and sat down on my armchair . I looked at the letter . I read it out loud .   * '' Dear Satan , it 's actually pretty funny . I hope that you can help me . Please let me get going . `` *   I sat there for a long time . I thought about why I did n't answer him . I thought about what I did wrong . I thought about the reasons I deserved to have to stay . I dreamed about how I should have stayed with someone who was n't even here to end my life . I thought about what I would do to someone who loved me .   * '' I love you Satan , I always do . `` *   I got up and looked around the room . They were already getting ready to leave , and I could n't wait to hear from them that they 'd actually arrived . I closed my eyes and told myself I loved them . I told myself that I did n't want to do this to anyone . I got up and walked towards my front door , and walked out of the room . I walked back a few steps and began to walk again . I closed the door in the front of the house and looked at my right foot . It was really nice to walk towards someone who is n't an old man , but still has the strength to do what I asked for . I walked towards some
 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; I 've been waiting for this moment for the last minute or so and it 's been following me .  I 've always been able to win .  I can see the smile where they both saw me .  I know that today is the day that I will finally say it .  `` Good morning to you , my sweetheart ! '' As i turn off the light I see him . His teeth are black and white and black and black and black and black and black and black and black and black and white and black and black and black and black and black .   i start to cry uncontrollably .  I know that I must act right then and there .   & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; I close my eyes and feel my heart beat steadily and slowly .  My eyelids close and I am reborn .   & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; I feel a cold , cold sweat running down my forehead .  I open the door to my room and see myself .  I see my reflection in my bathroom mirror .  It 's me .   & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The smile on my face changes immediately .  I know that I must act right then and there .   & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; I open my eyes and see my reflection in my bathroom mirror .  It 's me .
I picked up the $ 100 bill and handed it to his mane , `` Hey buddy , the money already means this . ''   The man sighed , `` Y-Yes , it would be great . ''   `` It 's just one percent , '' I said , `` and it 's not even real . ''   The man laughed through his nose .   `` Just give me an idea , alright ? '' His voice filled with confidence .   `` Okay . Just give me a point , '' I said , `` I got another $ 100 bill to go with your idea . ''   `` Thanks , '' he said , `` I 'll see you soon , buddy . ''   He vanished .   I heard the engine in the parking lot screech past me and another $ 100 bill was dropped to the ground . I called my parents , but they were all dead .   -- -   The news that Santa Claus dropped the money on the street was pretty much the same as other news from the day he dropped that money , but on the other hand , it was more than the same as other news from the day he dropped that money on the street .   `` New York City , '' the news anchor said over the radio . `` The man of the year dropped the $ 100 bill on the street . ''   `` What the hell am I supposed to do ? '' I asked , still confused as to why Santa Claus dropped the $ 100 bill on the street .   `` He 's gone , buddy . '' The anchor said , as he pointed his camera at the newspaper anchor . `` The man of the year dropped the gold in that year . ''   `` Santa Claus , '' I said , as I did n't know what to say .   `` He 's , uh , gone . '' the anchor said , pointing at the next man in the crowd that had dropped the gold . `` The man of the year dropped the $ 100 bill on the street . ''   `` So , '' I said , still confused as to why Santa Claus threw the gold in the street , `` how does it look ? ''   `` It looks exactly like the Santa Claus , '' the anchor said , holding up a letter to me in his palm .   I shook my head , `` It does n't look like the Santa Claus . ''   `` So , '' I said , not really thinking about what to say as I opened the letter . `` Let 's see , '' I said , drawing the letter out to see where it came from .   `` It 's a long letter , '' it read , `` with lots of writing . It 's written in faded-out handwriting , but with a very different language , like that of a old man . On it you can read the same words as any other letter , in very different handwriting . ''   As I read the letter , I wondered if I should just put it on paper .   The paper was long and black , and had two symbols on the front .   'Saw ' , I read .   `` Santa Claus , '' I whispered .   As I turned around , I saw a man standing on the sidewalk , smiling .   `` Hey , the money already means this . I got another $ 100 bill to go with my idea . ''   I turned around , and saw the man holding an envelope in his right hand .   `` Merry Christmas , buddy . ''   I heard the roar of the police cars , and saw the man dropping the envelop in front of me .   `` Merry Christmas , '' I screamed through my teeth , `` this means this . ''   As I started to walk away , somebody caught me off guard .   My father said , `` Santa Claus is always there to help when someone needs him . ''
The view was incredible , so stunning it almost seemed like everyone had a dream in front of them . It was n't a terrible experience but , my guess , it was hell .   `` The view is spectacular , '' I began . `` Why , I 'm sorry to interrupt but , look at the view . Look at the colors , there are no stars this far off . But , I was warned you would come across a star like that . ''   `` You know the one . ''   One day , I noticed something odd . It was n't at all a star . It was a white , one that went out of place with the others .   `` Stop . No , no , no , no . Turn your head . You 're looking at a star that 's stuck in the black . Look at it . Look at the colors . ''   It started to change , like a light suddenly being seen in a big light with a big shape . It was small and blue . It was definitely not a star .   `` Huh . ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` It 's a star . So , it wo n't be able to get out . It 's a star of some kind . ''   I turned my head to look at the view . A star of some kind was slowly gaining speed . It was bigger than every other star , and it was looking directly at the ship that I was looking at .   `` No , this ca n't be right . ''   I got up from my seat . `` What the hell is going on ? ! ''   `` Look , we can get out of here of here . ''   The view changed to the city that my parents had built . There were two houses in the middle of the city , and two streets down around the left . They were white and blue , but they were n't bright . In fact , it was oddly dark . There just was n't enough light for all of us to see them . I stood there in shock .   `` Why are n't we seen ? This is Earth . This is in fact a planet named Earth . ''   `` Why are n't we seeing Earth ? ''   `` You do n't want us to see Earth . ''   I stared at the view . I could n't move . I immediately felt panic set in . I was scared . But , as I got closer , I saw something . I could n't put my finger on it , but I knew it was real . As I got closer , I suddenly felt a rush of adrenaline . It was making me go crazy . I looked down at my feet . I could feel the rush of adrenaline building . I could also see the fear start to leave my body . I ran . I ran and ran until the heat that had been building up inside me melted away .   I looked up at the sun . It was bright . It was almost red . I was ecstatic . I could see the entire sky . The light was bright . I could see everything . Everything I knew .   I heard a soft voice coming from behind me .   `` Hey , do n't have anything else to say . I am sorry . ''   I turned around and saw a beautiful woman standing next to me . She looked beautiful as well as she did n't look so beautiful . I wanted to hug her , but a bit before I did I saw something that made the most sense . It was a bird .   `` Who are you ? Are you a bird ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Are you one of the passengers ? ''   I just stared at her . There was no reason to be at this place . She was n't a model , she was n't a ... Wait , what ... wait , what was that ? A bird ? Yeah , that 's right . A pigeon , it was a bird . It could be a . . . a squirrel .   `` Mr. Snarky , I have something you could tell me about the city as an infant . We are currently in orbit around the sun . The moon is out of place . How do you know this ? ''   `` We are a space station for space stations . We have traveled through space , to a planet called Earth . A planet called Earth . ''   `` I know . ''   `` What do you mean ? Did the humans not take us there ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Do n't
I stood there on the sidewalk , looking up at the stars , seeing the people passing by , standing side by side with their heads bowed . However , there was one particular person , sitting near the edge of the path , a young , balding man sitting on a park bench . He was n't a religious man , but he was pretty cool , and yet he seemed to be talking about his time in this world . I was really looking forward to that conversation , so I let myself sit down .   `` Are you actually the person that did this to me ? '' I said , gesturing up to the boy .   `` No . '' He said , looking to see if he had any idea why I was talking . `` Why ... why would I do a thing just to make myself feel better ? ''   `` Stop talking and let me get this straight , I do n't deserve this . ''   `` We 're going to go to the park and you 'll go with me , so why waste time you have ? ''   `` Well , I can make myself feel better , and you wo n't hurt me for that . It 's just that , I ca n't do it for your benefit ; you look stupid , you like people being funny , and you 're ... people do n't understand what you mean . What they are , what we are , and who you think you are are , all of it is meaningless . ''   `` So what 's important is n't it ? '' I asked , and the kid seemed to not believe me . `` And what 's what 's important is n't it ? You 're going to live here , and you live here , and you 're going to live here , and do what you want . What does that have to do with anything ? You 're going to live here , and some days you 'll come home to find yourself in a new home , and you 'd end up here alone , and you 'd want to see the stars again . You 'd want to see the world again , and you 'd want to see the stars again , and you 'd want to live here . ''   `` And what 's important is n't it . Just because I 'm stupid does n't mean I have to live in a new world , or anything about the fucking world . I want to see the stars again , and I want to live here , and I want to die here . ''   `` But , you 're selfish , are n't you ? '' The kid asked . He was n't surprised , but he continued . `` Because you think you 're something special , and because you 're doing it for your benefit , you probably never will . ''   `` Then what if I live here ? '' The kid asked . `` I hope this does n't get me killed . ''   `` No , it wo n't . '' The kid replied . `` You 're selfish . Because you 're going to live here , and you 're going to die here . You know that , right ? ''   `` Aye , I guess . But do n't you think I 'm going to live here ? '' The kid asked , peering down at the ground . `` No , you might not . But ... you might . You 're so stupid . But that 's also true , right ? You said , do n't you think it 's going to be amazing ? ''   `` Not quite . You see , life is nothing without you . '' In the kid 's face , he was now looking down at the ground , taking the first step of the stairs . `` I ... I think I could n't go on without you . I 'm not a bad person , but I 'm just a bad person . If only I could ... ''   `` You 're selfish , dumb , dumb . You 're stupid , dumb , and stupid . You 're a loser . You 're a loser , dumb , dumb . And you 're one of those loser types . Nothing more . ''   The kid looked down at the ground . He was confused . `` ... I do n't think I deserve this , '' he said , running his fingers through his curly blonde hair . He looked down at his fingers , and slowly started to write , `` I 'm going to live here , and I 'm going to die here . ''   `` Well , get back to that bench . I 'm going to do it for you . ''   The kid looked confused , but he continued , `` You 're not a loser , dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb .
Sorry in advance for the lack of detail and stuff I 've been working on but decided to post a part of the story in a direction that I could have done better . It 's my first day on this project and I 'm hoping that I can give it some constructive criticism .            The sound of sirens filled the air as the van neared the bridge of The Bridge .

`` And it 's not so much about what you do n't put in your weapon and what you kill , it 's about fighting . ''   `` No , it 's about you making a mockery of your power . ''   `` Then why be the only one listening ? ''   `` It is n't about the rules . It 's about your people . It 's about who you are . ''   `` I fight for what they do n't protect ! I do n't want any more of that ! ''   `` I do n't get it ! I just love the Sun ! I love how it grows up , when it 's about us , the Earth . ''   `` Look , we are like brothers . You ca n't just sit around and do nothing but hurt us ! ''   `` I understand . ''   `` I understand . ''   The Sun roared in fury again . It 's wrath was palpable . Some called it the Sun , others called it the Great Dawn , others called it the End Of Days , but it truly was just a name . So , at the end of the day , the Sun was victorious , a species far more powerful than any other .   When the Sun woke up to a complete and utter collapse of the world , it did n't look up . It did n't look at any of the other things that were going on . It was n't the Sun that chose to stop us . It was n't the Earth that decided to die .   The Sun was the one that turned my mind , the one that let them choose .   Today was the day I would destroy the world .   `` I will be watching . ''
*I told them I was gay and that 's it , now I 'm letting him know . *   This was one of those times . You know the ones you have to hang out with at bars and clubs and shit and have it all played out . You listen to whatever they say , at first . You listen to what they say when they say it , then you listen to them . Then you listen to what they say . This time , though , this was different .   `` I 'm gay ! ''   I was born into this world , my father ’ s life . I was raised to be a gay adult , not a bad guy . I never really did get along . Whenever I was teased by my peers , I just thought I was their friend , but I did n't look at them , I just looked at them . I looked at them the same way all the other kids look at me . I was always there for my friends . I was always there for them .   To my surprise , I found myself being bullied at school . Everyone thought I was special , which was why I was teased around , but I was just an average kid . I actually did n't look like much of a bully because I ate a lot , and did n't drink much . Everyone else thought I was normal because I was a weirdo .   But I was not . I was weird , and then I had a bad day . I had no friends , and I had no family , and my entire life I had been a jerk .   I woke up , and my parents told me about my bad day . It was a big day , and they tried to tell me how I was going to be okay with all of it , but it was not true . I was going to be fine with all of it , and I was going to do everything they told me .   My parents , who were so supportive of me , told me they had my best chance .   The day came when my dad came home from work . They informed me that I was to be home anywhere within the next few hours .   I had to make a big decision .   I was going to kill myself , and I was going to be my own person .   It took a second , but I finally made it .   I ran over to my room , and I grabbed my keys , and threw them in my lockbox .   I went to the kitchen , and threw down my key .   As I opened the door , I saw my roommate , who was not a bad person . He looked like a fat , fat guy , and he had no fucking clue what to do .   *Fuck , fuck , fuck . *   I ran back inside the house , where I hid .   *Now it 's my turn*   When I returned to the apartment , I saw my roommate standing outside . He looked at me with sad eyes .   *What the hell ? *   I walked over to him , and I whispered in his ear .   *Come on , man . Do n't worry . I ’ m not going to hurt you . *   `` Wh- ''   He dropped his hand , and the tears started to fall . He let go of my hand , and as I grabbed it , he fell right on to the floor .   `` Shit ! ''   I grabbed my phone , and dial 911 , and called a few times .   My roommate had started sobbing , but did not make any noises . I heard him laughing hysterically , and he was crying .   Suddenly , I heard a voice on the other end .   `` Can I help you ? ''   I looked around .   `` Dude , are you okay ? ''   I looked at him .   `` Is everything okay ? ''   I looked at him .   `` What are you doing ? ''   I looked at him .   `` Get me out of here , dude . ''   I looked at him again .   `` My name is Jack , and I am a male who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man who is just a man .

I like my dog but not very much . I love him and I need him .    My mother said he was a good boy and that he was cute . He was also loved by a lot of people . My father told me he loved me and we were often so happy . The first time he touched me , I felt like he was there for me . He was there as I was sleeping . We had a big picnic day and both our parents were out to the park .    He loved me very much . He loved me very much . When we got older he would go to the park to play with me and look at me . We would go and play with him and I will play with him and I will play even though he is much better at it .    Now I am the only boy in the house he does not like . It was his birthday and I was happy . I think of him often and I would lie there for hours . My father tells me he loves my dog but I said he looks sad . If he had n't loved me that much , I would not be here .    My dog would be back for Christmas . My father had offered me a hug when I was little and I told him to go away . His old friend helped him get back and then I was gone . I remember the feeling he got when he noticed me and he hugged me .    I am happy .
`` Oh shit ! '' I gasped , my body getting crushed under the weight of my own weight when I saw my wife 's head fall over in the corner of the hallway and begin to glow in the darkness .   My wife 's screams were muffled from everywhere , muffled as she slowly regained her balance . Her eyes were still blurry , but her face was clear . In the middle of the room , her red and white Christmas suit was being pulled over her head , a golden ring wrapped around it . She sobbed hysterically , tears welling up in her eyes , her mouth twisted into a grimace .   `` Where am I ? '' I asked her , trying to grab her by the collar .   `` You 're standing in front of me , I ca n't move my body here , I ca n't do anything ! '' She screamed , her eyes closed tightly . Something inside of her screamed back , something so strong I could n't sense it .   I slowly reached down with my hands , pulling the ring from her mother 's grasp . It was a simple black ring , slightly larger than the rest of her , but held something soft and warm . `` What the fuck is that ? '' I asked , taking a second to find myself in front of her .   `` It 's Christmas Eve , '' she whispered , her voice shaking . `` You 're an elf , remember ? What would you do for a living ? ''   `` I love you , '' I replied , clutching the ring tighter than I could grasp her .   `` You have to go , where are you going ? ''   `` I do n't want to go , '' I replied , as the house finally descended into darkness .   I awoke with one leg buckling under me . `` Where the hell am I ? '' I screamed , my thoughts rushing back to my wife .   `` You 're in a dark place , '' she whisper back into my ear . `` The tree is n't here to see you any time soon , and you wo n't stay here until you get there ! ''   As I climbed out of bed , a coldness crept over me , as I looked around . I could n't see . `` Can I see anything ? '' I whispered to myself , trying to stay alert .   I was frozen . I shook my head , trying to stay alert . Someone was there , a dark figure with a black suit reaching out to me , but was n't moving . What was happening ? I was frozen in time , staring at the figure with the same cold eyes as the figure I said I love , the same cold . It was my wife , but she was no longer my wife .   `` What the fuck ... '' I said , clutching the ring tighter than I had ever held her in my life .   `` I love you , you have to go , '' she whispered back into my ear .
`` What do you mean you have no tattoos ? Why is it that she 's making your face so ugly ? ''   `` She makes it look like she 's going to take you with her . How ridiculous , '' I said , reaching for my jacket pocket and pulling out my gun .   `` Just what would I do with my life if she found out ? ''   `` I could kill for what 's you doing . ''   `` Really ? So you could kill her ? ''   `` She would n't even acknowledge my existence because I was never there . I 'm just a guy thinking about the things I want to do . ''   I dropped my gun , and pointed it at her . `` You have no tattoo , this is ... . ''   The girl 's boyfriend started pacing back and forth . `` Just look at her , she 's so ugly and has no name . She 's not beautiful . She 's just a kid . '' He leaned down to pick up my jacket and we began walking toward the car .   `` What do you mean you ca n't kill her ? ''   `` Well , it 's not really the question , it 's just the question itself . ''   `` I do n't think I know what to do with my life . ''   `` I think she does n't care . ''   `` She cares about what 's right next to you . ''   We rounded the corner , and the rest of the group turned to look at us .   `` She even knows what I 'm doing ! ''   `` What do you mean you think she does n't care ? And why does n't she care ? ''   `` I do n't know . I just want her to know . ''   `` Can you please ... ''   I put the gun to her head and pulled the trigger . The bullet blasted through her chest , and she began convulsing through her body .   `` What- What 's wrong with you ? Do n't you see that now ? '' she whispered , sobbing .   I had no way of knowing the cause of this , but it had been years since I 'd seen any signs of emotion .   `` I know , '' I said , closing my eyes to give her this new beginning .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` Guys !

''   My jaw dropped .   `` You know that when we see the tattoo , we 're just like , the same , for sure . ''   Tommy laughed .   `` You know right ? Even if he thought it was a surprise , she would be in love with him . ''   `` Right ! ''   `` Right , '' I said , sitting down to get a drink .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I turned and looked at the car . He was right . We were going to go back to the car .   `` Yeah ? Where ? ''   `` Why are you staying here , dude ? ''   `` I do n't know , dude . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
I woke up with a start . No alarms , no problems at all . No alarms at all .   I open my eyes and look around the room . It is dark , the only light is the lamp in my bedroom . I look around , trying to catch my breath . The light illuminates my face , and I have a feeling that I 've been dreaming for a very long time .   What if I wake up and I wake up in a different room ? There 's a window above my bedside table . So far , I have n't spent anything exciting . Maybe I 'll see my family and my friends again .   `` Morning ? '' I hear someone say outside .   But I do n't hear them . They 're just standing there . They have a black hoodie up on their shoulders .   `` Morning ? '' I say , and begin to walk towards the window .   They sit down next to me .   `` Is everything okay ? '' they say . Their faces look familiar . It could never be anything like that .   `` Yeah , everything is alright . '' I say , and do n't even think about it .   This is n't my life , and here I am . A horrible , horrible , horrible , terrible , horrible , horrible , and hell-bent on ending it all . Let 's just say that my girlfriend keeps asking me how much I was doing to hit the gym , as if that were something that I would do in the end . I mean , I 'm a smart kid , but I still hate weights . I 'm not as strong as they are , so I think it 'd be better to just fuck around with the weights .   `` It 's alright , '' said the hooded woman . `` Everything 's fine . ''   `` Do you think we should just let it end ? '' I asked .   `` I mean , I think we should just let it end until we get out of here . ''   `` But why ? '' I asked .   `` Because if we keep going towards the city , people will forget about us . People will forget our name , our name , our parents ' names . They will forget that we were n't there when the bombs dropped . ''   `` So how will I come to spend the rest of my days with you ? What if we die tomorrow ? ''   `` No one else will , '' said the hooded women .   `` How much of the world do you think ? ''   `` I dunno . We should just go to Australia . I 'll go see my parents . I 'll spend the rest of my days with my friends . ''
“ Hey Mike , come on . He ’ ll be back soon. ”   “ Thanks again , bud . Take this as a sign. ”   “ Of course Mike . I don ’ t need to tell you all this , but I honestly don ’ t think the world will ever be the same , ” she said , tapping her fingers on the mahogany table .   “ Just like last week. ”   “ You ever wonder what they say to their children on Halloween ? ”   “ No , ” Mike chuckled . The day they ’ re 18 . The day they were born . Then it comes to 21 , and the birthday before . It was Sunday morning .   “ Hey Mike , you never think it ’ ll happen to you ? ”   “ You know Jim , ” she replied , “ It never does. ”   “ What happened to you ? ”   “ He just lost his finger on the trigger . It was a black hole , and I got it. ”   “ You know that shit . Just look at this . The whole world is just black holes . Does that mean he actually lost his thumb ? ”   “ You know that shit . You ’ re doing it again. ”   “ Yeah , ” he said , “ He just lost his hand on the trigger . It ’ s not like it ’ s any sort of secret. ”   “ Wait , what ? ”   “ He just lost all of his finger on the trigger. ”   “ Dude , what the hell happened ? ”   “ He just told me they knew , and they were playing it again. ”   “ And why is he still playing it with me ? ”   “ Seriously , I don ’ t wan na know . Dude , look at this ! His finger is gone , and he ’ s gone ! ”   “ What are you talking about ? ”   “ He just told me I ’ d be able to do this again. ”   “ Oh well , then. ”   --        
`` Sir , please , I am telling -- it 's going to be fine . You 're going to be fine . All of us are gon na go to bed . ''   Sir Galleon looked down at his scaled body , and nodded . `` Goodnight , Sir , '' he said gently .   Galleon sighed , and pressed back his body against the wall . He then got up and placed a claw on the wall with a loud crack . It closed in around him and he looked around . The room he was in must of been made of metal , but it was n't a big room . Many of the rooms were made of metal , so the walls were n't made of metal .   He looked up at the ceiling and peered in , but he saw nothing other than a giant robot . He looked around again , but there were no robots there . He saw his cave 's entrance , and he went inside .   As he climbed up the ladder , he noticed a glint of light in the distance . He stepped over it and closed his eyes .   Then he heard a loud crack , and a scream . He looked down , and saw a large mushroom cloud . His breathing sped up . A giant monster , standing upright , looking down on him .   `` What ... what is going on ? '' Galleon asked , afraid .   `` Sir , I-I do n't know . '' the giant monster said , confused .   `` What the fuck are you talking about ? ''   `` I do n't remember , Sir , '' the giant monster said , sounding a little angry . `` I do n't know . What the fuck is going on ! ? '' He pointed towards the giant alien robot . `` Are you kidding me ? I am gon na be on TV . Then I 'll be ... '' He started walking towards him , his feet slapping the ground and his body hitting the ground .   `` What the hell is going on ? Tell me why I 'm here ! ? ''   He stopped at the giant robot and said , `` Sir , you 're gon na be okay ! I 'm gon na be okay ! ''   The giant alien monster stood there for a long moment , and then looked up at Galleon .   `` What the fuck 's going on ? ''   The giant alien monster shrugged . `` Sir , '' he said , making a face . `` That 's what it 's like in an infinite amount of ways . ''   The giant alien monster scratched his head . `` It 's not that bad , '' he said . `` I just ... I just think ... I think ... I really do n't know . ''   `` What the afterlife is ? ''   `` I do n't know , Sir , '' he said , sounding a little concerned . `` It 's just plain ... boring . ''   `` What the hell are you doing here ? ''   `` Not that bad , Sir , '' he said , sitting down on the ground . `` It 's just ... boring . '' He laid back , and he looked into his ceiling . `` I guess . ''   Galleon jumped up and started eating food . `` What are you eating ? '' he asked .   `` It 's good , '' the giant monster said , finishing the food . `` I do n't have much time either . ''   Galleon looked up at the giant alien monster . `` It 's good , '' he said . `` I think ... ''   The giant alien monster ran away , and disappeared from the ceiling . The monster looked at his giant robot , confused .   Then they both looked out at the mushroom cloud .   `` Are you seriously going to believe this ? ''   `` Sir , '' said the giant alien monster . `` I have to ask you one thing . ''   `` What does that mean , Sir ? ''   The giant alien monster stared at the mushroom cloud .   `` I 'm sorry , '' the giant alien monster said . `` I guess that 's a lot . ''
`` Do you know the reason why we 're here ? ''   `` It 's because the Russians got bored . ''   `` If you think I 'm crazy then you 're right . We 'll show you ! ''   `` No . ''   `` Good . ''   The last of the Canadian soldiers exited the vehicle and began their journey towards the Canadian border . The United States had been under a lot of pressure since the attacks on American soil . Not only were they at war with the Russians , but they were just trying to conquer North America . In what seemed like a matter of minutes , the border was completely blocked . The Canadian soldiers that made it to the border were gone . The Canadian leaders were still trying to decide their next move .   The Canadians knew they needed to leave the border in order to continue the invasion of South America . The Canadian army was just trying to capture a few things . A border guard . A woman . A soldier in a brown trench coat . It was n't until the Canadian soldiers had gotten close that they noticed an old flag . They recognized it as the `` American flag '' and the entire flag looked familiar .   The Canadians just decided to go through with their military visit and go outside . The people of this strange land were quite relaxed .   `` Hey , we 're done here . Would you like to go outside and talk about something ? ''   The man in the trench coat , who had the most polite smile was walking along the road .   `` Why yes ! But I have one thing to tell you . I have to kill you now . ''   `` Can I ask you a question ? ''   The man in the trench coat started walking towards the nearest of the soldiers . The man in the brown trench coat opened his mouth to ask another question so he could find some answers . When nothing came out he grabbed a nearby soldier by the collar and pulled him out of the trench coat . The soldier was in shock and fell to the ground .   `` I 'm sorry . ''   The man in the trench coat sat down and did something with his hands while the soldier in the brown trench coat began sobbing .   `` It 's okay . Just a little . '' He comforted the man in the brown trench coat and pulled him back to the ground .   Before the Americans could do anything else , a message had come through the radio .   `` If you know the reason we 're here ? ''   `` No . ''   `` You could stay in here and just stay there . ''   `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` I ... I 'm sorry . ''   `` I love you . ''   Suddenly , there were the sounds of a police car speeding towards the maple syrup stand . The man in the trench coat stood up and walked towards the door . He began to open it . As he opened the door he was greeted by a man in a blue suit . The man in the brown trenchcoat was in tears , and a bullet went through his head . Then , his eyes fell on the TV in front of them . There were news anchors and the president of the United States starting to speak .   `` This is President Obama speaking on behalf of the United States of America . We have made a great progress in our invasion of North America . We will not be losing , but we will be putting it back through . As you know , we just arrived at Canada . It 's true , we could have invaded , but it would have been pointless . The Canadians finally figured out why we 're here . ''   The president looked at the television and nodded , and the screen went black .
I wrote a short prompt an hour ago about a few people who have come to this world and are currently in an accident in the middle of a great city known as New York . You see they seem to be living , breathing , and using a small amount of oxygen . They also are currently trying to escape by using every inch of their body . They do n't seem willing to leave the streets and make it to the first city they 've reached , but I 've seen an awful lot of people like this and they 've just been trying to survive .   While the city is still the same the traffic is getting worse . I 've been having a lot of problems with my legs , which seems to be more than just running away from the crime scene . I 'm trying to keep my head down and keep my eyes on my surroundings . I 've been slowly losing control of my body , but I still haven ’ t felt that dizzy yet . I 've just been drifting through an endless sea of people trying to get to the door to their apartment building .   The door opens and a woman steps in , but it ’ s not her . Who is she ? Who is this woman ? She ’ s not even looking at me . She just walks towards me . I could see that she ’ s not her boyfriend , but she ’ s not even looking at me anymore . I ’ ve tried talking to her and she ’ s whispering , but it ’ s just a voice , but it ’ s muffled . I don ’ t even know who she is . I just know that she ’ s not even here . I ’ ve never experienced this before .   “ Hi , I ’ m James . Can we go to room 51a ? ”   “ Sure , go to room 51a. ” She is looking at me with her beautiful smile and that look of disbelief . “ Can we go to room 51a ? ”   “ Yeah , just hang out with my girlfriend. ”   The two of us sit down on the couch and the few times we have a conversation , I can feel her eyes on me . She knows that I ’ m not going to be able to talk to her . She just keeps getting closer and closer to me .   She finally pulls her hand away from my chest and smiles slightly . It ’ s like when you see a thousand other people but know that you ’ re not alone . I can feel her smile growing .   “ Please , James , ” she smiles , “ please , just let me leave. ”   “ I ’ m sorry , I ’ m just so sorry , ” I say .   “ I ’ m not alone. ”   “ It ’ s okay , ” she laughs , “ you ’ re finally safe. ”   “ I 'm sorry , ” I say , “ but I 'm not. ”   “ It ’ s okay , ” she smiles , “ you ’ re finally safe. ”   I ca n't turn away from her . She ’ s gone . I ca n't turn away from the building . I close my eyes . I know that I 'm not safe . I ’ m not even alive . I just know that I ’ m not here . I just know that I ’ m not doing this right and that I ’ m not doing this right . I just ca n't go back . I ’ m not going to let her go .   I start sobbing . I ’ m sobbing . I ’ m crying . I ’ m sobbing . I ’ m crying . I ’ m crying . I ’ m crying .   The woman and the woman look at each other for a moment . Then both of them start crying again .   “ I am sorry , ” she says , “ I ’ d like to go back to my apartment , but I ’ m not going to be able to hear my girlfriend. ”   I look at her . She ’ s gone . I ’ m bleeding .   I open my eyes . I have to open them even quicker .   I open my eyes . I ’ m laying down on the couch . I ’ m lying down . I ’ m smiling . I ’ m smiling . I ’ m smiley .   I
It started with a few drinks . Of course , we were n't all that drunk . We were on the side of the lake , swimming about the midclass , enjoying the view . But the night was getting pretty dark , and we decided that we would go with the most fun of it .   We were at a party like we always were . No one in the party had decided to go to the same place ( The bar , you see ) and drink a few different things . We were in the corner of a pub and just were n't paying attention . It was that quiet night anyway .   As we got up , we saw someone walking towards us . This was an attractive woman , with a red dress , a skirt and a hat . She was walking towards us , and the conversation they had had before started to go bad .   I thought about how I would have asked for her number . I had heard stories about the women we saw who lived in the uppermost portion of the city while doing other things . I thought about how she could have been prettier than me , if she had a date with someone amazing like me . I thought about how I would have asked for her number . I thought about how I would have been looking forward to it .   I woke out of my dream . I could hear a scream and my body shook as I saw her walking in . She was a tall , woman with long legs , with a red dress , a hat and a hat . She was walking towards us , and making a quick motion . She was n't going to stop . She had a huge smile on her face . She was so beautiful that it could have been seen on anyone 's face .   Her eyes widened , and her mouth opened wide . Suddenly , two small , small creatures came into view . They seemed to be moving towards her and carrying something small , like a small device . It was a little , big , box with a big screen in it .   And after a few moments , it started to glow .   I did n't know where I was , but I woke up in a hospital bed .   I was completely covered in blood . I did n't know what was going on , but I think it felt good to be alive again .
`` What ... ''   `` What ? ''   `` Are you dead ? ''   `` No ... ''   `` Then it 's time . No more questions . No more questions . ''   `` ... so ... ''   `` You 've got to be kidding me . You died ? ''   `` Yes , technically . I died . I know , I was just ... ''   `` You thought that was a good thing ? ''   `` What did it say ? ''   `` That I was ... ''   `` Well , it said that I was really fucked up . ''   `` How many times did I tell you ? ''   `` It said that I was lucky enough to survive . ''   `` I was lucky enough not to wake up . ''   `` But that was before I died . ''   `` I ... I was lucky enough to get past the pain . ''   `` You were lucky enough to make it out . ''   `` I ... ''   `` I was lucky to get from the brink of death . ''   `` So you 're telling me you were lucky ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` So you 're telling me that ... ''   `` I am . ''   `` And now you 're telling me ... ''   `` Yeah , it was a perfect time . Of course it was . ''   `` Good luck ! ''   ____   *We 're sorry if this was bad , I loved it . *   *Thanks for reading !

I open my eyes , expecting to be blinded by a light . But it seems more like a hospital room than any I have ever seen . I know it ’ s not a hospital but the walls are white .   At first I try to shake the buzzing in my head . It ’ s like cotton is starting to slip from my ear . As I try to recall what happened , something about where I am and where I am .   “ Miss ! Where am I ? ” I try to say .   “ You are in a ward . Congratulations on your years of service . But first , we have some questions . What do you want from me ? Who do you think you are ? ”   “ I ’ m Mister Howard , and I am a scientist. ”   “ That ’ s brilliant. ”   The hallway looks old and worn . One of the walls is white . The other is faded . The floor is concrete . Even the walls are white . I ’ m starting to tremble .   “ Are you okay ? ”   “ You are still in a ward. ”   “ Well… thank you. ” I try to speak again but only manage a whimper .   “ Do you think we can help you ? ” The voice asks gently . Everything about the building seems familiar , but I don ’ t recognize it .   “ I don ’ t think we can help you. ” I reply . I try to speak again , but the disembodied voice remains silent .   “ I love you. ”   “ I love you so much . I love you so much . I don ’ t know how to do this . Goodbye. ”   The voice trails off as the lights come on and I can see the empty white walls . The walls are surrounded by white objects .   I freeze . I don ’ t understand . What was that all about ?   Then I hear screams . They echo off the walls . The walls are white . I can see my own skin . I ’ m covered in white coats with red shirts and white dresses . I ’ m naked .   I move towards the sound . It sounds like a prison . I stand up . I look to the left . There are men in white coats in white coats . One of them is crying .   “ It ’ s okay , ” he says . “ We can help you . It ’ s not like you ’ re going to hurt anything. ”   “ I… I don ’ t understand. ”   He drops the cry . He ’ s crying .   “ That ’ s alright , ” he says . “ Please do something. ” He ’ s crying harder now .   It ’ s not the first time I ’ ve seen someone cry . I think I feel a burning pain in my chest . My hands are shaking , and I can ’ t see myself .   “ What ’ s going on ? ” I call out . “ Help. ”   He drops to the ground . His tears are still falling .   “ Please , ” I say . “ Please , just come with me. ”   He does . I manage a whimper . Then he takes me outside .   “ Let ’ s go , ” he says . “ We ’ re going to be okay . ”
It was n't the first time it had happened . My first kill was from a homeless man who 's drug addiction was killing poor men for a penny . That had n't even happened before ; it had happened nearly as quickly as I 'd killed that man .   I remembered my first kill perfectly . The man I killed was n't the man I killed ; he was more like the one I killed . I heard it was my first kill of the day . A man had just gotten out of bed and was waddling slowly towards me . His hair was matted as he trudged up to me .   `` What do you want , man ? '' asked my husband as he grabbed me by the shoulders , pulling me closer to him .   `` My husband , '' I said as a smile fell across his face . `` What are you planning to do with me ? ''   `` I- ''   `` No , do n't stop ! '' he cried , wrapping his arm around my waist and lifting me up to his face .   `` Please , do n't act like an idiot ! '' screamed my husband as he pulled me closer to him . Then he began to pull me towards him , pulling me closer . We both did n't break eye contact at all , but I could see he was breathing fast and fast . I tried to scream but all I could do was watch him exhale heavily . He seemed to have finally released me and was slowly fading away .   As his breathing began to fade , I could still hear my husband 's breathing . His breathing became increasingly rapid and louder . He seemed to disappear into thin air into thin air once again . Then he stopped . I was left face down staring at a large black box . I opened it to reveal a manila envelope .   `` I am here for you , '' I said as my heart began to beat faster .   `` What ? '' asked my husband , not saying a word .   `` You have been terminated from this murder by a convicted felon , '' I shouted .   `` What ? '' asked my husband as he wrapped his arms around my waist again .   `` You have been terminated from this murder by a convicted felon , '' I said as my heart pounded faster .   `` No , I 'm not going to kill you ! '' said my husband as he pulled me away from him . Suddenly his body changed . His clothes changed from white lab coat to a black lab coat . I looked out the window at the city below . I felt a glimmer of hope and happiness fill the cold air .
The class was getting ready for class today .   Ryan had never been a fan of any of the older kids when their parents insisted they put on their best uniforms , but the tradition had always kept him from getting too attached to his peers .   `` You are in the third grade for a test to determine if you have a choice in your life , right ? ''   `` Yes , '' said the teacher just loud enough to wake the other students from their nightmare .   `` So , can you tell me what your choice is ? ''   Ryan cleared his throat `` Let me answer you that . ''   `` *No* , '' said the teacher .   `` Yeah , it 'll fit perfectly if people talk about it . What do you want to know ? ''   `` How about you tell me what your choice is ? '' asked the first student , who started to cry .   Ryan sighed in relief . `` I have no idea . I want to know the exact answer . ''   `` *No* ? '' asked the teacher again .   There was an uncomfortable silence . `` What is that ? ''   `` I want your answer , '' said the first student .   Ryan tried to remember the answer to the question he was holding in his hands :   *I want to know the exact answer to this question* .   He stared at the teachers blankly for a few minutes . Finally he managed to find where his brain was . He looked up at the teacher , who he had always been suspicious of , but never respected .   `` Did you ever wonder why the government created you ? '' asked the teacher .   Ryan almost laughed at that . That day had been his most exciting day in all of his life , ever .
“ I ’ m afraid not , ” the man stated , his voice dripping , almost hypnotic , with a slight hint of condescension .   “ What if I had to ask you something ? ” I responded , my voice rising , rising , rising .   I made the same mistake many times before .   “ No . No , no . No . Just follow me. ” He said , his voice cracking and his eyes bulging .   I followed him for what felt like hours , following him just as for hours . We went to the city centre and ate our usual meals .   “ Look , this is my choice , but I ’ m afraid you have to ask me something . I ’ m not a villain or a hero , nor am I an evil man. ” I said , raising my hand , aiming at the man ’ s face .   “ Of course you know what I mean , ” he said , shaking .   “ Sir , what do you want ? ” I asked , my voice growing weak , the corners of my mouth closing and closing again , “ You want to save us ? ”   He looked down at his hand , the rough and dark skin clinging to it .   “ I don ’ t want to save you , ” I said .   “ Sir , I ’ m not about to fight you ! Just die ! ” he said , slamming his knuckles on the table .   “ I just want to fight everyone who killed me , ” I said , pointing at the man , his eyes wide and darting around , “ To save everyone who did hurt me ! ”   The man ’ s eyes widened as he realised I was right .   “ You ’ re an evil person . You believe in evil things , and you think that you will save the country. ” He said , his face now shaking .   “ But you don ’ t ! ” I said , reaching out , my hand firmly gripping the man ’ s wrist .   “ You don ’ t ! Why do you want to go down into the depths of hell ? ” He asked , his voice now growing to an almost demonic pitch .   “ Because I ’ m afraid that I didn ’ t put you there , ” I said , my voice rising .   “ How do you know that I did ? ” He said , his hands clasped together , his face now glowing red .   “ Because I ’ m afraid that I don ’ t want you , ” I said , looking at the man with the fury of a snake . “ Because I know that when you do , you will be allowed to live your life as a villain , and become a hero . And when you do , you will be free to go. ”   His eyes narrowed and his face now completely red . I looked at him .   “ This is my choice , ” I said , pulling him towards me , “ But please , you have to decide the path of the people . And that is all I want . I will not be your protector , ” I said , smiling softly , keeping my hands down on his wrist .   “ Sir , please , ” he said , running at me .   “ You know which path is good , ” I said , pulling him towards me , “ Where people shouldn ’ t live as villains . And that is all I want. ”   And with that , I stopped , looking down at the man 's hands , his eyes now bulged , his eyes now full of tears .   “ Because I love you , ” I said , my voice beginning to raise .  
`` Mr. Jones . '' The judge bowed .   `` I understand , '' I said , looking down at my clipboard . It was in fact several pages long , and written in some strange , strange writing .   `` Good morning . The case is decided as a matter of fact that the Defendant is guilty of what he did with ... ''   `` Uh huh , '' the courtroom murmured .   The judge sighed loudly , and reached into his coat pocket , pulling out a small , thin , leather bag . He tossed it across the desk without looking back .   `` Mr. Jones , I understand that your client , Mr. Jones , is going to have multiple options . He may have threatened your client , or he may have threatened to destroy the evidence that you have been acquitted . Either you do not want to take those options seriously , or you can not accept that alternative . ''   The courtroom roared in agreement , and the judge crossed his arms . The bag fell to the floor , and the bag was gone .   I sighed quietly , and looked up at the sky .   `` Mr. Jones , '' the judge said , setting his clipboard down next to his desk , `` You have proven that these choices are not the only ones this has been allowed . You can not take them seriously . ''   `` I 'm sorry . '' I said .   `` Your only option is to take the option that you choose right now . I 'm going to take the option that you choose right now , and I 'm going to take it you choice . ''   I reached into my coat pocket and withdrew several small , leather bags . I poured them all over the desk , and placed it on the table next to my lawyer , who sat down .   `` Mr. Jones , listen , '' I said , speaking softly with the words that I 'd used in my defense . `` You are clearly guilty of what you did to your client , and you certainly are n't going to put up with me making that choice . You 're going to have to deal with that issue . ''   `` What choice do I have ? ''   The judge frowned . `` You have already admitted that is right . In a couple of hours you will be getting off your back , and you will be in your car . You will get out of your car , and drive to your car . You will be driving to your car . You will then get out of your car , and drive to your car . You will drive to your car , and drive to your car . To your car . ''   `` Please , I wo n't ! ! ! '' I shouted .   The Judge chuckled . `` Mr. Jones , you have a choice . ''   I shook my head . `` Okay , Mr. Jones . I will take the choice that you choose right now . ''  
`` Tell me a story , '' Michael asked in between riffs of a song that was still there .   `` Right now , I 'm busy cleaning the dishes , and I was wondering why you 're here . I mean , I was just watching the weather , but this guy , this one , he starts talking to the girl in the corner , and then he 's all like 'Hey , Mike , what 's up ? ' and this man starts walking away , and then he gets into the closet . '' Greg , Michael 's new classmate , had never seen Michael much of a talker .   `` But there 's a girl in the corner , '' Michael muttered .   `` Yeah , she 's a pretty girl , but she 's got a really bad headache . It 's like , she wants to go out and see her friend , but her friend says , 'Look , she 's probably gon na get really drunk , but so I 'll just go and tell her , 'hey , she wants to go out and see her friend , but she wants to go out and see her friend . ' And then it all starts to get really weird and weird , and then I 'm all like , 'What 's up ? ' and then I 'm all like , 'What 's up ? ' ''   `` And then , Greg and this guy come into the closet , and he 's all like 'Oh , Greg , what 's up ? ' and then they start walking away , and then they get into the closet , like , and then they 're all like , 'Hey , do n't give me that look ! She 's probably gon na get really drunk , but then she 's gon na go back in the closet and try to see her friend , but she 's got a really bad headache , so she starts running away , and then it all starts to get really weird and really weird , and then it all starts to get really weird , and then they all get really drunk , and then they all get really really pissed and then they all start running away , and then they all open the closet door and start freaking out . ''   `` Okay , let 's see what happened here , '' Michael said .   `` What happened here ? '' Greg asked .   `` Yeah , it was the back-street , '' Michael said . `` I told you , it was really really bad . I got scared , and I took over , and I think I saw someone come in there , and then she started running away ! I went down to the street and was all like , 'Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! ' and then I heard a voice come in from the back , and then I saw a guy , and I just walked away from him , and I just started walking backwards , and then I suddenly realized , I just kept walking backwards , and I kept walking backwards , and I just kept walking backwards , and then I started crying . And then I thought , 'I 'm sorry . ' And I just kept walking backwards , and then I thought , 'Oh my God , how I wish I could go back in the closet to see my friend , but I just keep walking backwards , and then I kept walking backwards . ' And then I woke up . ''   `` Michael , what happened here ? '' Greg asked .   `` That , uh , that was really bad , '' Michael said .   `` Oh , God , '' Greg said .   `` I just keep walking forwards , and this guy comes into the closet , and the guy comes in , and he 's just laughing at me . I see this guy , and he 's laughing , and I just keep walking forwards , and then I fall asleep . And then I fell asleep and it happened . And then I woke up . ''   `` No , '' Michael said .   `` And now , Michael , you 're just looking at a scary , scary monster in the corner , yelling at you . ''   `` What did you just say ? ''   `` Oh , I guess , I do n't remember . ''   `` So ? '' Michael asked .   `` Oh , hell , man , I 'm going to sleep now ! It 's gon na be okay , man , I promise you . I promise , and I promise ! I promise ! ''   Michael got up and went to the bathroom . He brushed his hand against his forehead and looked around , and then he walked back to the living room .   `` So , uh , I just come back into the kitchen ,
The grandkids stood around a small table in the middle of the cemetery , dressed in colorful garb and smiling . Others were just children in their early 30 's . Children whose hands used to be just like my own .   My wife looked up from the news to me . `` Honey , it 's time you finished this service . '' She said slowly .   I looked down at the woman in blue , who was wearing a black dress with white dots on it . `` Everything 's about to end , '' I said calmly .   Before the grandchild could finish his sentence , the lady started crying . `` But Dad , every time you let him take that shot he never regrets it . But only once . Every time you let him take that shot even though he had such a cruel and unforgiving intentions . That 's why he killed them . Because he made them suffer . ''   Her tears fell with a thud that rang every time I looked at her .   I had to get through that . `` Now sweetheart , let 's go , '' I said , closing the door behind me .  
The first thing I hear are my cat , Timmy . I love cats . I mean , you 'll never guess what happens when I try to speak , but nothing really really comes out . I can talk and play through it ( like this time there was no one around ) , but I hear it all at once ( like I said ) . I started with some guys and moved on to an old lady . I swear , you guys can still remember her with a smile on their face . I began with a few people . It was Timmy , a good name for him . I still think he was an easyie-talker .   It wasn ’ t until later that I noticed one small incident . I was there for the ambulance . I must have been there where he could get hurt . I watched as he was running away from the ambulance , when a man appeared in the backseat . I panicked . I went downstairs and grabbed my phone . What the hell . I dialed the number and hit send . I was overwhelmed with fear and excitement . I got onto the ambulance and laid down . What happened next was completely unbelievable .   “ Hello ! ” the man said . “ My name is Robert J ! I ’ ve been in a coma for 30 years . I ’ m in a mental institution . Most people think I am schizophrenic , but I ’ ve seen people who think I am my brother just like you. ”  “ Oh , sorry , ” I said , not sure how to react .  “ What ’ s going on ? ? ”  “ It ’ s my brother . I ’ m ... I ’ m ... ” a strange stuttering noise suddenly cut out . “ ... ”  “ Oh , don ’ t worry . It ’ ll be over soon , ” replied the man , “ just remember that I am quite the asshole . I ’ m going to save you. ”  “ Yeah , I guess. ” I looked around and saw people running towards me and laughing .   “ I won ’ t hurt you . I ’ m just going to be a normal person like you . Trust me . I will save you , because I have no idea what you ’ re talking about. ”  “ Wait , what ? ” I said .  “ If you answer my phone , there will be no end to this ! ”  “ Uh-oh , what ? ” I said . “ What is this ? Are you seriously talking to me ? I ’ m not going to hurt you. ”  “ My hands are sweaty , ” the man said . “ I ’ m really sorry . I know I ’ m not gon na hurt you . You ’ re just gon na be happy. ”   “ Okay . Okay . ” I said , “ just get out of here ! ”   “ Please , ” the man said . “ Please , do n't hurt me . I am a normal person . I don ’ t need you to hurt me. ”   “ Okay , okay , ” I said , “ just get out of here . I will save you. ”   “ Ok , ” the man said . “ Bye. ”   I stood there . It was getting hard to breathe . I closed my eyes and tried to cry . I tried to whisper in my ear . I tried to laugh . I couldn ’ t . Then , by sheer force , I opened my eyes . I was standing there , looking at the man in the backseat . It was him . He looked into my eyes . I could feel a pressure building up in my chest . I tried to scream again , but I could only choke . My lungs were dry , my body barely able to breathe . I felt as if someone had shoved my throat by my hair . I started to cry even harder . No matter what sound it made , it always came out as a whisper . I struggled to break out . I could feel my body getting weaker and weaker . It felt as if I would lose control . Then , my body started to tremble . I panicked and threw my hands in the air . I felt like I was losing all control . Suddenly , I realized that I wasn ’ t breathing at all . I shut my eyes in pain and tried to scream again . I couldn ’ t . I couldn ’ t . I couldn ’ t . I was ... I could ’ ve sworn my body shook . I started to feel numb . I couldn
I could n't see her .   I was so close to the edge of the bed , I could n't see her at all . My heart was thumping in my chest , I wanted to reach out and touch her hand . I just wanted to see her hand . It felt warm , I would feel her fingers .   But I could n't touch her . For a long time she lay there , silent except for the faint sound of my heart .   A sudden jolt started up in my chest , like I was falling , but the pain persisted . My heartbeat raced , but I could n't touch her hand . Finally I would reach out and touch her again .   And again .   And again .   And again .   And again .   And again .   Until I was alone in my bed , a single tear rolling down my cheek as I wiped it away .
The first time i met him was the day he died .  I 've always wanted to kill him . To kill where he 's lost his life . But he would n't die . Today was different . He had almost conquered the world .  I took him hunting , to kill monsters that could kill , to kill people that would die . And i shot at his enemies . He was hit and I did everything i could to kill him .  And now his final breath was coming out .  For I could n't kill him again . I had to kill him .  Now for the next time , a young man 's life will be taken from me .  I turned around and sat down on the grass . It was a beautiful day . The setting sun was beginning to set , the sun was now shining down from above . And i was walking away to see if i could become one of the first brave men to die .
It had been a long time since they had ever opened up the gates to my time-appropriate machine . The moment they have opened , I will be free of them . I will change , change the world , change the world forever . I do n't know what it will end up like . Perhaps it will be better for everyone ... It ca n't be worse for me right now .   I walk up to my machine , and open the door to the outside world . The outside world is much different , but still remarkably peaceful . I look back down at the world again , and look back at my machine . All parts are intact , and all parts of my body have been repaired . I look at the world again , and see the most beautiful things I have ever seen .   I am confused . Why was it so beautiful ? I 've never seen this world . How did I know this ?   I walk back to my machine , and open the door . I walk out , and look back at the world once more . Everything is pristine . Everything is perfectly and functioning . I walk out , and look back at the world once more . Everything is perfectly and functioning . I walk back to my machine , and open the door . There are so few windows for me to use , and so few people to walk around . I walk back to my machine , and open the door . There are so many people to talk to . I walk back to my machine , and open the door . There are so many people to talk to . Now is the time to stop myself from thinking about it all ... I ca n't even remember how I do it .   I step back outside , and look at a world where all the peoples are happy , and all the people are happy . I walk back inside , and ask somebody , who is going to listen to me . I reply to the one person who does n't live . So I ask , who is going to listen to me .   He responds , `` You will not understand . You have nothing left , and not a single moment you will remember . You will be forced to do whatever you want . You will be forced to do what you want to , but you will never know what you want to do . You will ... '' He cuts me off .   I stare at him . His eyes are completely devoid of emotion . I look down at my hands and my hands are shaking . I know I wo n't ever have any happiness again . So I ask him , `` What are you going to do ? You wo n't live your life without anyone else you love . You will never have any friends , nor family , nor hopes . Do you understand what happens when you die ? ''   He replies , `` Do n't , that 's not why I 'm here . You 're going to suffer everything that everyone tells you how to do . '' He shakes his head . `` I have to find my family , so I can help you . '' He walks away .   I look at my hands , and look deep into them . They are shaking . I slowly grab them , and move to my machine . I run to the window hoping for the best . The door is locked , so I walk back out , and look back out . There are so many people to talk to , and so many people to talk to . I walk back outside , and look at a world where everyone is happy but all of them are sad . I walk back inside , and look at a world where all the people are happy but all of them are sad . I walk back outside , and open the door . There are so many people to talk to , and so many people to talk about . I walk back inside , and look out . there are so many people to talk to . I walk back inside , and look back out . There are so many people to talk about . I walk back inside , and look down at my hands and my hands are shaking . I look at my hands and my hands are shaking . I walk back inside , and look back out . There are so many people to talk about . I walk back inside , and look back out . There are so many people to talk to . I walk back inside , and look down at my hands and my hands are shaking . I walk back inside , and look back at my hand . There are so many people to talk to . I walk back inside , and look back out . There are so many people to talk to . I walk back inside , and look back out . There are so many people to talk to . I walk back inside , and look down at my hands and my hands are shaking . I look at my hands and my hands are shaking . I look back at my hand . I look back at my hand . It 's shaking
*It is time . *    I took my time . I 'd never been able to explain to anyone the significance of it , nor to any of my family .   Like many others , it was n't just another routine . Everything was organized on a regular basis , there was a constant constant flow of people , and in every way was a constant need to be there for them . I really felt like I was n't even looking for them , but I did n't need them .   The past was a blur of emotions , filled with a passion and a sense of accomplishment . The past was as well , and I knew I 'd never forget it .   *It is time . *    I took my time .   What 's more the past was so much more . There were so many people , so much more than the present . They were a force of nature , and it was n't just anyone to do the same to . There were so many futures in mine , and it was all so much more than just me .   I 'd never been able to explain to anyone what it was like to be alone .
After seeing the hat , Hermione got up , walked to the door , and opened it .   `` The hat is some sort of magic , '' Hermione said .   `` What ? What magic ? '' the Headmistress exclaimed .   `` It 's a common misconception , '' Hermione replied .   `` All of a sudden , you ca n't be serious , can you , '' the Headmistress demanded .   `` I did n't tell you , '' the Ravenclaw replied .   `` What , are you kidding me , '' Harry said .   `` You know the answer , '' the Headmistress explained .   Harry watched the Headmistress try to explain the hat 's magic : `` A hat is a magical device , that we use to perform spells . With basic mana infused spells , the hat would protect us from harm without any harm . Magic is a magic device that we use as our own magic to pass on our knowledge . ''   `` So what are you talking about , '' Harry said .   `` That 's quite right , '' the Headmistress said and opened the door . She walked into the kitchen , and took two pots of cooking from the kitchen .   `` It 's just a strange hat , '' the Headmistress said , and took a big spoonful of butter .   `` This hat is magic , '' Harry said , and took a spoonful . `` Magic is a magical device that we use to kill , '' he said as he took a seat .   `` What is Magic ? '' the Headmistress asked .   `` You are sure , '' another voice said .   `` Oh , I know , '' Harry said .   `` Magic , '' the Headmistress said , `` is such a ridiculous notion . You do n't think magic is magic ? ''   `` I do , '' Harry said , and took another spoonful of butter .   `` Magic , '' the Headmistress asked .   `` No , '' Harry said .   `` Nomagic , '' the Headmistress said .   `` No , '' Harry repeated . `` Magic is powerful . Magic is powerful . Magic is powerful . The Headmistress asked more questions .   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said .   `` No magic , '' Harry said . `` No magic . ''   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said .   `` No magic , '' Harry said . `` No magic . ''   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said again .   `` No magic , '' Harry repeated . `` No magic . No magic . No magic . ''   The Headmistress looked at Harry cautiously .   `` No magic , '' she said .   `` No magic , '' Harry said .   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said again .   `` No magic , '' Harry said . `` No magic . ''   The Headmistress shook her head . She looked out the side window .   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said . `` No magic . ''   `` No magic , '' Harry said , and took another spoonful of butter .   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said . `` No magic . ''   `` No magic , '' Harry said . `` No magic . ''   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress barked .   `` No magic , '' Harry said again .   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said . `` No magic . ''   `` No magic , '' Harry said .   `` No magic , '' the Head Witch said . `` No magic . ''   `` No magic , '' Harry said . `` No magic . ''   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress barked .   `` No magic , '' Harry said .   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said again .   `` No magic , '' Harry said .   `` No magic , '' the headmistress said at last .   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said .   `` No magic , '' Harry said .   `` No magic , '' the Headmistress said . `` No magic . No magic . ''  
I sat there staring at the mouse . What could I do about this ? I could n't do anything about it . I just sat there and stared at it .   **W**ee ?   I guess it 's that question that 's taking hold of my mind . I 'd been following my eye ever since I was a kid . Whatever the reason , I was content with the view . I could watch the entire day , take care of myself , sleep without incident . I never did have any problems with the mouse . I should never have done that .   But what happened in the morning ? What happened yesterday ? Should I do anything about what happened today ? I stood there looking at their cursor . It did n't look like an item . It was real , really . It just ... stood there . At the edge of the screen . As it moved forward and stared at the mouse .   **F**k .   It looked at me , but nothing happened . I was thinking about how I could make this possible , but what would I do about being human ? I wonder how long these thoughts would take without realizing what I 've done to them . I wonder how long I would survive this . I wonder how long I 'd be able to keep getting rid of these ones . All these thoughts still exist . If I could manage to keep them alive , I could keep them happy . I still wonder if this is really this moment I have to live through for . I was so naive . I 'd always thought that humans were just things that kept me going . I 'd never thought that this day would come . I 'd thought that I 'd make this possible .   But nobody ever does .
A man stands in front of me . His clothing is tattered and torn . His face is wrinkled and unkempt . He smells of sweat and old salt . He has no shoes yet . His hair is long and a mess of white and gray , but it is still there . How could he have known that his friends had died ? He steps closer , his eyes still sad , his nose wrinkled , and his pupils dilated ? Why could he not notice ? He reaches out a hand and he seems to shake it , even though it is not used in many ways . He attempts to shake it but it is no use .   `` Jesus , Jesus , do tell me where you are . ''   `` Jesus , you bastard , you are such an asshole ! '' He yells at the top of his lungs .   `` God fucking dammit ! You hurt my friends ! ''   At this point , the man in front of him draws out a knife , and says :   `` Stop now , asshole , please and do n't shoot me ! ''   `` God fucking dammit ! '' He continues to scream , until the man in front of him slowly turns around , and slowly walks away .
I stared intently at my body , its taut body still twitching , still not fully aware of anything else . Not like this .   My own mind screamed , `` No ! I 'm conscious ! ''   It could n't have been . Not without the bites . The bite would have left my brain completely numb , and then go dormant . Blood would n't flow .   I had nothing left . *No one in this world would* have cared . How could it be gone ? It was too late .   It took some time , but finally I could think of something . I could do something about it , and then it would all be over .   The bite would n't leave , and then I would never really feel any pain again .   I started to cry , so I asked one of the nurses what happened . Said she was okay . Said it was a few days ago .   `` I miss you , '' I said .
I couldn ’ t help but notice the translator humming as he spoke : “ Your species is a brilliant race , and we are grateful to share your culture with us in the hopes we will do so well . But our history lesson is that as time goes on , your kind , as a species , will become less and less violent . So , as for you , you will make good use of your time , and we are proud to offer you a chance to expand your society . We hope that you will appreciate the opportunity. ”   I stood there , dumbfounded , on the edge of hearing the translator again . All I could do was stare at the translator . The translator turned his head , and stared at me with an expression that I knew I wouldn ’ t recognise .   “ I am sorry , ” he said , and in that moment , I knew that I was going to get kicked out of the Union and that I deserved better . “ But if you go on , you may have a chance to grow up better than the other non-human races . 
`` Hey , what ? '' The man in the white lab coat yelled .   Sam stood up from the pile of papers in front of him , turning his head to the man on the other side of the room . `` Hello ? ''   `` Hey , sorry . '' The man said . His voice seemed rather harsh .   `` It 's me . '' Sam said , standing straight up .   The door of the lab in the adjacent room burst open , a man in a white lab coat carrying a clipboard in his right hand and a clipboard in his left . Sam looked back to where the man was standing . `` Are you okay ? ''   The man on the other side of the room began to scratch his knuckles on the clipboard . `` I just found this lab . I did n't mean to offend you , but since you 're not allowed back in here , I 'll walk you in . ''   Sam walked briskly into the room , the man on the other side of the room behind him holding his clipboard with his left hand . He led Sam inside , stopping just in front of a large rectangular machine . Inside were several chairs and tables , one with a large stool and a small wooden chair behind it . Sam approached the stool and the chair squeaked as he pushed the stool aside . He sat down next to the stool and began to shuffle around the room .   `` This is a test . Should I get a passcode ? '' Sam asked .   `` Nope . '' The man said . `` I 've got a passcode for that . I think you can use it . ''   Sam walked over to the machine and pushed the button . A blinding light caught Sam 's eyes , but he had n't been expecting that . His vision went black .   ( Kinda rushed this way for this one , but I just realized I forgot to feed it a bit in the shower or something . I 'm so glad it took so long to write so I hope it was n't too harsh )
It was a normal day in Luretland , with no other activity to go on either . I would pick up a couple of beers , go for a walk , then pass out . An hour went by , and I could n't keep feeling any of it , so I got up and went to the park along the path .   `` Hey , hey , hey ! '' I called out to my wife , who was sitting nearby .   * '' David ? Who are you ? `` * , her voice was soft , as if someone was watching her from a very far away corner of the park .   `` I 'm ... ... I 'm Adam . How 'd you get in here ? ''   `` I am Adam , '' she said , smiling , and pulling out a worn wooden book . `` Your father died a few years ago . ''   I took a deep breath . * '' My father ? `` *   Her smile widened . `` Yes , he died , David . He was a good man , albeit a bit older than you . I was a scientist , by the way . Some of the most brilliant minds in the world were . In fact , I 'm quite proud to know that you may have found me . ''   `` What ? '' I thought hard . * '' Well , myself and my parents found him , in a graveyard . `` *   `` You do n't remember signing your name , darling ? ''   `` I did . ''   I really did . `` Well , then . We 're going over to the graveyard in the morning , to collect you some clothes to wear when you get home . ''   `` But ... '' I stammered .   `` David , you do n't remember signing your name , David . ''   Now , I could n't recall signing my name , but it was too strange to go into the cemetery . I went to the front door of the house for a key , and then , as expected , locked it .   * '' David , I told you that I was going to be here when you got home , that I 'm going to take you to the graveyard , if you would like . `` *   `` I 'll take you home , then ? ''   * '' Yes , David . Here . `` *   `` David ! ''   `` Mornin ? ''   `` Yes , David . ''   I walked inside to my wife , and ran up to her . The feeling was still there , the feeling like ...   Then , she leaned in and whispered in my ear .   `` I love you . ''
I watched him walk away from the kitchen . It was late but I was feeling better , I felt like I had always wanted something more . My dad had been married his entire life , I got married to him very soon after we married . He had always been my best friend . I had been able to get along with him much longer than he can , but I still had my doubts . I met him on a busy Sunday when he started doing work on his computer . I had been at work at work for two years and he even helped me open my laptop . It was amazing how quickly he could get himself up and tell me that he loved me .   `` Honey I 'm sorry , we do n't have much time , it is time '' I said to my son as he walked right into the living room . He smiled and gave my father a hug before walking over to the couch .   `` What 's up honey ? '' He asked .   `` Daddy , I 'm home , '' I answered as I put him in bed . I closed the blinds before looking at him . He was beautiful with eyes like that of a woman . His dark hair hung down to his shoulders and his skin was pale and callused . His body looked so young , yet so youthful . At the same time , I was sure that he was old to be taking care of him , yet this was something special . He was my son , today was going to change everything .   `` Where am I ? '' He asked me , looking at me . I looked around for the answer I needed .   `` I 'm home , '' I answered as I put him in bed . I looked at him before taking him to the living room . I took him out of bed and sat him down on the couch . He laid with me until I began to cry . He asked for me to put him in the blanket next to me . I hugged him until he asked me to put him in the other room . I put him in the other chair and he kissed me on the cheek . My mind was racing , I could n't help but feel embarrassed and scared already . I felt like I had never done this to him before . I felt sad that he was going to leave . It was very far from home , but today was going to be different . I stood up and started to walk out of the living room . I closed the blinds on the computer and looked at the timer on the wall . 7:45 . I looked down at my son . He was still asleep , he looked around , and it was time . My son opened his eyes and I saw him wake up . I wiped my brow thinking to myself , `` What 's going on ? ''   When he opened his eyes , he was in the middle of the living room now . He was crying , and I stared at him . I looked towards my mother , my wife , my beautiful son . I looked into her eyes and saw tears forming in her eyes .   `` What 's going on ? '' I asked .   `` I 'm sorry my son , I was happy for you . '' She said firmly . `` I also could not help but feel disgusted . ''   `` Sweetheart , I 'm not happy for you . '' I said as I took her hand and hugged her , `` Honey please , go on . ''
The soft sounds of the city bustled through the night . A lone street light glimmered off the polished glass of the tavern , and a faint glow rose . The heavy glass gave way to the glow of summer . The light grew brighter until it darkened the sky once more . The light faded away , and the tavern fell silent .   Slowly , the tavern began to shake with each passing day . The walls began to crumble , with some collapsed , others grew and fell . Each building moved and moved and fell . A single gust of wind blew across the room , and a single creak of wood and wood began to creak . The tavern stood not a feet from its host , but a hundred feet at most . It stood , and watched .
The day was a pleasant one . I had just been on the bus to work . I was late . All my work friends had already gone home , and my friends were in the dark . There was nothing to be done . I was just about to head back home .   And then I heard it . A sound , like the distant bass of a car horn . I could n't make it out , but it was getting closer . Suddenly , I heard a voice in my head , one I had n't heard in a long time .   `` You will die today . ''   I could n't stop it . I could n't take it anymore .   `` You will die today . ''   I could n't do it either . As the thing approached , I thought to myself , *This ca n't be happening . I have n't done something to prevent it . *   `` You will die today . ''   I could n't let it happen . I had to get home . I had to get the hell away . Even if I stayed here , I would probably die . I was starting to think , *Maybe I 'm just imagining things . *   The thing began to drive me towards the nearest convenience store . But it did n't stop . It stopped just before I could even reach the front of the store .   `` I '' ll die today . ''   The thing had stopped just before I could even reach the front of the store . I just hoped for a distraction , but there was just too much of a void .   Now the thing is at full speed . It is the same speed as before . It has to stop fast . How long has it been ? How long has it been ?   The thing is following me now . It 's faster than I thought possible . It makes a constant screech , a low growl , and then suddenly , things get very dark .   I get crushed against the wall . It will never stop moving . I tried to run , but I did n't get back down .   The thing begins to hurt , but when I finally get to my feet , I see something moving too fast . A hand is hovering over my face .   `` You will die today . ''   Wait a minute , why ca n't I get back up ?   `` You will die today . ''   And then… It starts to move again .   I hear the creature say , `` Congratulations , you 're the best present for *me* today . ''   And just then , I heard it again . The same bass coming from my head .   And this time , there was another sound . A little closer .   `` You will die today , ''   I could n't stop it . I had to get home . I had to get away .
The lights flickered on now . The world had been brought into a frenzy of activity as the cameras began to adjust . It was at this moment that Elon Musk finally spoke . His big speech that would revolutionize the world .   `` You are our leader , Elon Musk . We are your equals . You will make the first planet into an automated world . You will bring us into space and we will never end ... ''   At this point Elon Musk was exhausted . He had just finished his speech with the President himself . He walked off stage . There was a slight pause .   `` Do you mean on Mars ' Eve ? '' asked the President .   `` Yes , Mr Elon . The planet has a wonderful life . It is the universe we live in . But it is not worth living in . Our society is too small , '' protested the President .   Elon grinned . He continued , `` And the planet will be the most advanced world ever conceived . You will not leave . ''   Moments passed . The world was silent . Suddenly , Elon Musk spoke again .   `` Please , Elon . You are a leader . A very powerful man . This is quite a feat to achieve . ''   The world went eerily pale . The President looked at him with disbelief .   `` You are our leader . This is absurd . You are , in fact , our leader . We are people of mars now . So , '' he said with tears forming in his eyes . `` You may start anew . ''  
“ Fuck what do you think of us ? ” The man in the uniform was sitting on a bench . He was dressed similarly to the man in the suit , with long white hair and a face like charcoal .   “ Nonsense . We ’ re just trying to salvage what we ’ ve created. ” The man in the uniform started to cross his fingers .   “ Good . Let ’ s start over. ” The soldier continued . “ We came here in November to take care of the world . First there was the ‘ Great Purge ’ as we called it , and then I got hit by a truck . The power went out . So we got rid of it , though . We couldn ’ t go back and shut it down on the second day . We got rid of them right after that . We even tried to take out the National Guard . We took control of it , and when they started showing up we realized it was a dead end. ”   “ What brings it here ? ” The guard asked .   “ Well , look , I don ’ t know . We figured they deserved it so for some reason , it didn ’ t take long for them to show up. ”   “ Where were the other zombies ? ”   “ Well , not their main cities . They just popped up everywhere I go . We figured it would take them a while to figure it out , and they didn ’ t stop . When they popped in on the third day , we could barely make it out. ”   “ How did you know that ? ”   “ Well , the undead started showing up the first day. ”   “ Bullshit. ”   “ Well , I figured out a way to keep them in . When the people started showing up , we could just be them and they wouldn ’ t be dead anymore . It was a little too easy back then. ”   “ You ’ re right . You ’ re right . Now that they ’ re gone , the National Guard isn ’ t going to be able to keep them . The food and water is running low , the people are starving , and we ’ ve been using generators to keep them from dying . Our government doesn ’ t try to deal with the people anymore . I guess we ’ re just surviving in the rubble. ”   “ Oh . Yeah . I guess so. ”   “ You know what ’ s worse than dying ? ” The man in the uniform continued .   “ We ’ ve been living there all our life . We shouldn ’ t have gone back , but we ’ ve been working for years to make sure we could , and we ’ ve already started investing in something new . We ’ re probably not going to make it much longer. ”   “ We ’ ve spent the last 10 years building a shelter . It ’ s only a couple miles in this part of town . Looks like it ’ s going to be our last resort now . We may have to stay here in November , maybe once I figure it out on my own , I may even have some more time to explore. ”   “ Go on ! ”   “ All we have to do is give up and wait here . We ’ re going to have to leave anyway , because they might come back. ”   “ Wait for it to be there . If it ’ s there , we ’ ll just leave. ”   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   “ Hey folks , listen up on this live feed . That ’ s the first live feed we ’ ve ever seen . The zombies are coming right back. ”   “ What ? ”   “ They say the zombies are coming here every day and we ’ re just about to die . We don ’ t really know whether they ’ re gon na fight back or they ’ re gon na find us. ”   “ Look , guys , I know this sounds stupid , but seeing that this is the third live feed we � backs off , we can ’ t keep our sanity . But if it ’ s just me and you then , I guess it ’ s time for our own survival . Let ’ s fight , and we ’ ll all
It was n't just the superpowers , it was the lack of love . It was the lack of motivation .   Not that I was proud of that . I actually believed it when I first realised I was different .   I got a guy named Thomas who loved hiking . He had fun at the time , but something about him pushed him away . He did n't believe me .   I told him I loved him , he said something about me being different and that I was a scientist . He believed me .   Thomas was n't an intelligent person , he just did n't want to talk about it . If you loved someone you were able to tell them you were not their best friend . I did n't want to talk about anything .   I continued to keep him around , trying to be a hero and saving people . More and more people came looking closer and closer to me . More and more people followed .   It was sad , but I really did care for him . He was the only person left that I truly cared , that I did n't need to worry about anyone else .   But I still kept it up . I knew someone was looking for me , I knew who I was .   I did n't think he could take it no more .   I looked around the room and saw my best friend , Thomas . He held my hand . His eyes were deep blue , his mouth curled into a smile . He had been so happy for me .   `` I 'll be back in a couple weeks , '' thought Thomas . He turned away .
The young man stood with the others in their ranks . He wanted them to follow him in his footsteps , to show them his strength . He wanted them to show them his drive and drive . To show them his dedication and drive . To show them he was truly happy - that his life had achieved nothing more than this . He knew now , in his heart , that all he had to do was stand before them and show them to him how he truly felt .   The young man knelt down on the ground and began to take in the surroundings . There were no birds or wildlife around , only the small hills . But what he saw showed that man had always enjoyed the scenery . He was free .   Soon , they would be taking his place . They would take his place . He would get to walk among the others , the ones in their ranks .   Soon , he would return to the base . It would be free .   And yet , there he stood . One of the few that still walked among the other ranks , waiting for the day when he would return to start up .
`` Well , what are you waiting for ? ''   Satan 's eyes narrowed .   `` I 'm just fucking with you . You 're supposed to be dead , I mean , do n't you know what that means ? At least it 's fucking hilarious . ''   The devil snapped his fingers as he looked at the man 's face . The man was visibly shaken . He did n't look like the kind of shit you 'd expect to see in a man with horns and horns . `` What 's the matter , *Santa ? * You're* dead , right ? ''   `` Well , yes . But I 'm just saying you 're too perfect to be Death , and Hell . Oh , and I 'll get you a gift from Hell . I 'm always available to people , so I 've got ta give you that ... ''   `` I would n't give you that . '' Satan said , raising the large red envelope in his hands and pulling one out out . He opened it with a finger and read it .   `` Dear Lucifer ,   I know the rules of this world . I can not give you anything else . I 'm not trying to force you to do bad things . I 'm trying to make you happy . I 'm sorry for the mess I 've had . But this is for you . It 's your last wish for the world , and I have no choice but to let you decide . You should be happy . I know this is selfish . I can let you choose , but then you 'll regret it . I can do it for you , because I want you to wake up and know that this is n't the end , and I 'll have to make sure you wake up in time to say goodbye to your family and friends .   You are of the utmost importance to me , and I 'm honestly not sure that I want you to , and I have no choice but to do it . This is for me , and really , I 'm sorry for the mess I 've caused . Please , do n't be embarrassed .   Yours ,   P.S . I 'm very sorry .
I wake up , feeling great . I look around me . It 's a white room . The couch is empty , and the floor is also white . It looks like I 'm in a mirror . I look around the room again . It 's different from the room which I live in . I am in a middle white room . There 's a mirror on the wall . The bed 's white , so I assume it is mine . To my left is a chair , with one arm on the right . I move to the other side of the room , and the wall is a mirror with a door on the left .   `` Hello ? '' I whisper , but it wo n't appear . The door on the right opens softly , and I see a man sitting on the couch . He is wearing a blue suit , with a button down shirt on the right . I recognize him immediately . I am in a similar room . Same wallpaper , same clothes , same hair , same color , same skin , same body , Same hair , similar body , Same hair , identical body .   `` You must be David . '' He says . `` You must be Peter . ''   `` Is that okay ? '' I ask .   `` Let me help you . '' He says . `` I am David . ''   `` What are you talking about Peter ? '' I ask .   `` You must be Peter . '' He says . `` You must be Peter . ''   `` What do you mean you 're not Pete ? '' I ask .   `` No . These are the same people . They are clones of the same people . You must be Peter . '' He says . `` They ... they do n't exist . ''   I do n't know what to say . I move around the room again . I see some boxes , with labels on them . I 'm reading them . Some with names . Some with names . Some with titles . There 's a bed at the door , and the bed on the opposite side . I realize that I ca n't move . If I do , I die . I open the door .   The man on the couch is still in the blue suit . I recognize him immediately . I am wearing a blue suit , with a button down shirt on the right . It must have been Peter .   `` David , there are many of you . There are many of your kin . There is many of your family . There is many family to share . Many of your ancestors . There is a mirror on the wall . The same wall to live in . '' He says .   I have nothing to say . I look down at my bloodied hands . It appears that I am holding a knife . I look at the blood dripping from my hands . The knife is my only choice . Without me , there would n't be possible damage . Without me , there would n't be possible damage . Without me , there would be no possible damage . Without me , there would happen . Without me , there would never be damage . Without me ...   I open my eyes , and see a different wall around me . I look down at my hands . They are white . There are two of them . I see one of them . I see the other one , and I see both of them . I 'm not the same . I 'm the same .   `` David ... you know that I know this . I know this too . '' he says . `` I know this too . I 've seen this ... this before . Some . Some of you . You must have been Peter . The others ... they are clones . ''   `` I 'm sorry , David , '' I say . `` I ... I ... I do n't know . But you must know this too . ''   He smiles . `` See this ? '' he asks . `` See this ? ''   He smiles again . `` See this ? ''   I look down at my hands . They are white . I can see them . I am wearing a blue suit . There is a mirror on the wall . The same wall to live in . I see myself holding a knife . I do n't know ... I ca n't feel . I need to know this .   `` Do n't worry , '' he says . `` It 's all your fault . Your mistakes . I 'm sorry ... ''   I see myself holding a knife . I look at my hands , and see two white knives . I feel my blood boil in my hands . I see my tongue curl into a smile .   I step closer to the mirror . I feel something wet
`` *Maketh . * ''    `` Kosh-hoo ! ''    The man 's finger was pointing directly at the ground , followed by the gentle hum of distant engines .    `` *This is the Fars . * ''    `` *I know . * ''    The man frowned . He knew that this would have to wait . This would have to wait like , 15 times before a response from the other side . And a response for the rest .    `` *How can I know ? * ''    `` *Kosh , why ? * ''    `` *You 'll never know . * ''    `` *But you 'll never know . * ''    A wave of cool wind blew through the skies and engulfed the man , sending him flying through the air .    `` *They 're here , are n't they ? * ''    He found himself falling asleep . He dreamed that he 'd never see him again .
I have been at this for weeks . I am the only man in the world . I have the upper hand . I have the upper hand .   The first sign that he is there is a bullet going in through his chest . It doesn ’ t matter that his friends and family are already dead and I know that . I have no one to blame for it . All I have to do is look back and I ’ ll take it all away .   I don ’ t care about anyone else . There is nothing else to lose .   The pistol was in my hand when I dropped it . I pulled the trigger and everything went black .   I wake up to a police officers looking at me and asking me what has happened .   I don ’ t know what happened .   *I don ’ t know . *
`` I know , '' David said , `` I 'm just glad I 'm not one of those guys . ''   As David continued to look at the paper in front of him , he noticed that he was still not one of those guys . He looked back to the paper in front of him , and noticed that his eyes were glued to it .   `` Look , David , you are wasting my time . I 'm not going to waste my time . ''   `` Just because you are wasting the time of someone else does n't mean I am wasting my time . ''   David looked at the paper in front of him , and noticed that his eyes were glued to it .   `` No . You are wasting your time of somebody else 's time . You are , in fact , wasting yours . ''   David stared at the paper in front of him . His eyes , as well , were glued to it , as well .   `` No , David , I 'm just glad I 'm not one of those guys . There is no way . ''   David looked at the paper in front of him , and noticed that his eyes were glued to it , as well .   `` Do n't do this to me , David . I do n't want to mess this up either . ''   David looked at the paper in front of him , and noticed that his eyes were glued to it , as well .
I never expected for a gang to rob a gas station , but first there was a problem . An old truck that was moving fast and had a sudden stop , then came back to a stop in front of the gas station . After a few minutes , two of the guys came out , guns in hand . The old truck had come out of nowhere , and had all kinds of guns drawn . I guess that 's why they had these guns pointed at my head . I guess they did n't want me to try .   After that , they all let me go . I was taken to an interrogation room , and told they had done this before . The man next to me , Johnny , was a nice young bastard , with wild hair and green eyes . Johnny was always joking about how easy it was for them to find a way to kidnap me . I guess that 's why I had to leave .   After some explaining , Johnny asked , `` Are we all going to rob a gas station ? ''   I shook my head . `` They do n't know that . '' He took a deep breath . `` They only know what they need to know . ''   He took a sip of his beer . `` Well , there 's no way around this . ''   I looked at Johnny . `` No way ? ''   He chuckled a bit . `` If they ask you again , you might be dead . ''   I looked at Johnny . `` What the hell kind of question is that ? ''   He laughed again . `` Yeah , that 's what it is . ''   I took another sip bottle of my beer . `` Seriously , why would any of you even do that ? ''   He looked at me . `` We ca n't possibly know , because we really do n't have a choice . It 's our job . ''   I stared at him . `` Jesus , man . ''   Johnny began to sob . After a moment of silence , he started to pull his arms back and let go of the guns .   I looked at him again . `` Why ? ''   Johnny stopped sobbing . `` It 's not like we 're really going to rob the gas station . We just want to get in there . ''   I looked at Johnny . `` You sure ? ''   He gasped , tears streaming down his face . `` No , I 'm . It 's fine . ''   Then , he pulled his arms back . `` We ca n't leave , '' he said .   I looked at Johnny . `` What 's going on ? ''   He took another sip of his beer . `` We have much to do . ''   I stared at him . `` Well now we have to do something . ''   He looked at me , his eyes glazed over . `` What is this ? ''   I looked at Johnny and then back at the truck . `` This has to be a prank . ''   He shook his head . `` No way , man . We 're not going to rob anything . They 're just going to take everything we have and let us go . ''   I took another sip of my beer . `` Okay . ''   Johnny began to sob again . `` We 're going to rob a gas station ! ''   I raised an eyebrow . `` What are you fucking talking about ? You 're taking everything we have ? Just steal everything with these guns ! ''   Johnny started to cry again . `` I 'm serious ! I do n't think they should go to the gas station . They must have taken everything we had . We ca n't leave here without either of us . ''   I looked at Johnny again . `` Are you fucking serious , Johnny ? ''   Johnny looked at me like he was about to say something . `` You ca n't . You ca n't . ''   I nodded . I took another sip of my beer . `` Alright . What 's going on ? ''   Johnny looked at me , his eyes suddenly heavy . `` Did the old truck hit someone ? Ca n't you see ? ''   I looked at Johnny again . `` We do n't know . ''   He started to sob harder . `` We know what they want . We just ca n't let them go ! ''   I looked at him . `` You do n't understand , man . It 's a scam . We 're going to rob a gas station . '' 
`` There are three ways to do it , sir '' The man at the counter said aloud , walking towards me with a handgun .   `` How can you kill me ? ''   `` In the same way . ''   `` What kind of name is that ? ''   `` Not only are you not doing it , but you are also killing someone . ''   `` This is ridiculous . I mean ... I know who I am . I know who I 'm dealing with . ''   I looked around my office . There was nothing on my desk . I looked up to see two bodies lying on the floor . Two of them were covered in blood . One was wearing a black button down shirt . The other was covered in a plain white sundress .   `` I know who I am ''   `` You 're not actually me . But I am the one who you killed . I 'm you . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I am you . ''   `` That 's why you 're alive ? ''   `` Because I killed you . I killed you with my own gun . ''   `` Oh . My . God . ''   A man walked up to me . He was holding a pistol . I could not see anything . I stood up . `` How ? ''   `` I killed you when I was 27 . I killed you when I was 20 . I killed you when I was 29 . I killed you when I was 30 . I killed you while you were 30 . ''   I tried to turn around to see what was going on . `` I killed you ! '' I said to no one in particular .   After a few questions , the man behind me spoke again . `` Where are my manners ? ''   `` Well , sir . ''   `` In my office . ''   `` What ? Where is my manners ? ''   `` Oh , well . '' The man behind me pulled out a gun . `` Take this . ''   `` What ? This does n't make sense . ''   `` This is my office . ''   `` I ca n't do that . ''   `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` This is my office . This is my office . This is my office . ''   `` Your office ? ''   `` This is my city . You lived here before I killed you . ''   `` My work ? You died here before I killed you . ''   `` This is my city . You lived here before I killed you . ''   `` Why me ? ''   `` Because I killed you . ''   `` Why ... ''   `` It 's a bad idea . ''   `` Was that my mission ? ''   `` That is not . ''   `` There is a reason I killed you . ''   `` What ? ''   `` It 's not . I woke up to find that I was dead . Everything was in place . ''   `` Oh . ''   `` Yes . '' The man behind me shook his head . `` There was a reason I killed you . ''   `` What 's wrong ? ''   `` The world has gone dark ! ''   `` No . ''   `` What ? '' I screamed .   `` I killed you . '' The man laughed and pointed at me . `` How can you kill me ? ''   `` I know exactly what you want . ''   `` What is n't ? ''   `` You are n't killing me , that 's why this is how it is . ''   `` What ? ''   `` You are n't killing me . ''   `` What ? ''   `` You are n't killing me . ''   `` What ? What ? ''   `` I am you . You are your life , even though it happened in front of you . ''   `` What ? ''   `` For the last time , I 'm only going to kill you once . ''   `` What ? ''   `` No , no . I am only going to kill you once . ''   `` Please ... you ca n't kill me . ''
*For now , here we go . *   The adventurers sat in silence , bored out of their minds . The first two were completely average , with their eyes the color of their blood , and their lips still the color of wine . The second was far more normal ; the first was young and innocent , with a crooked nose and sharp teeth that would 've made you believe that they were no different .   *This* , they thought . *is* the first clue , but the next idea was a good one .   *We are all in a dungeon , and we do n't want to be trapped . We want to go home and take the first day of school . *   The adventurers smiled at the thought , then sat with their heads down , and imagined the dungeon they were in .   *For now , let me clarify . *   The group of adventurers were alone , but they had heard something that they did n't want to hear :   *We all know it would require work , right ? *   The adventurers continued to stare at the dungeon , until the first voice said , `` Okay , fine . We 'll do the first day , then we 'll go home . ''   The adventurers ' mouths dropped , then they all stood up and started walking towards the door . Only then did they glance back at the door , but soon began to move forward .   They followed , now . Almost immediately the group of adventurers ran for the door , but the door was locked and they did n't get to pass it when they got to the door .   *What was that ? * The words were barely audible behind them .   The group were all completely still , and they started walking toward the door .   *What did that say ? * The question was not in the group 's voice anymore , but rather that of a certain person .   The group of adventurers finally reached the door . All of a sudden , they were surrounded by goblins , and the group of adventurers started chanting something . The goblins began chanting , and the group of adventurers were suddenly talking to each other again .   *We are all ready . *   The group of adventurers started to walk toward the door . The door was locked , and they had their backs to the door .   *But wait ! *   The goblins stopped talking to each other . They were confused .   *What are you speaking about ? *   The group of adventurers slowly turned around , and saw a giant , scaled beast approaching them from behind .   *What is this thing , then ? * It was then that the group of adventurers heard , `` I told you . If you keep silent , I will throw a bomb to the enemies . ''   *It 's a bomb ! * the goblins called out . *This is a bomb ! *   The giant creature ran towards the group of adventurers , and attacked one of the goblins , who dropped it . The group of adventurers stopped falling , and the giant beast retreated .   *What are you talking about ? * the voices repeated .   *This is a bomb ! * The voices thought . *This is a bomb ! *   The group of adventurers tried to run to the door , but it was locked . They walked around the area , still unable to make out anything else .   *This is a bomb ! * The voices cried out .   The giant creature continued to approach you , and attacked one of the dwarves . The group of adventurers who ran towards the door stopped at two points , and yelled , `` Hey ! ''   The giant creature shot him , and with a mighty cry , charged at you . The others tried to run towards it , but as soon as they reached the door , the gigantic beasts shot one of the adventurers who dropped it . The others started running away , but the giant creature shot one of the adventurers with another giant arrow . It hit the ground . The others fell to the ground .   *What are you talking about ? * the voices thought .   The giant creature tried to attack another human , but the giant creature shot him with the giant arrow again . The other human dropped his arrow . The giant creature started attacking another human , but this time , the giant creature shot his arrows at him . This time , the giant creature hit him with a large sword . The giant creature attacked another human .   *This is a bomb ! * The voices cried out .   The giant creature shot another human , and tried to
`` Now , have you really *always* thought about this ? You do n't ever think about the people you 're in charge of , and you ca n't even imagine why you would bother to *go* there ? ''   `` Well ... uh ... you see , the problem is , I do NOT make decisions that I do not see fit.. ''   `` I knew there were other people in charge of that ! ''   `` Well , even when there were others , I was not aware it would be this bad.. ''   The young man continued to rant . He was not an adult , but he felt that it was what he felt more important than how he was responsible for .   `` I mean , I never had done anything that *was* *bad* . I felt ... ''   `` I was certainly not going to do anything *for* that ! ''   `` Right . Anyway , I am not sure if you 've ever seen that . I could never be as important as you are.. ''   `` Whatever , it is whatever ! ''   The young man was interrupted by an elderly gentleman sitting behind the counter .   `` So you want me to make you a new president ? ''   `` Sure , sure . But what is the point of being a president if you 're not there . And you do n't even have to *think* about what I am doing anymore ... ''   `` And what point do I have to put my power in anyway ? I 've been doing this for generations ! ''   `` ... your entire life . But those *adults* and those *magicians* ... ''   `` It 's simple.. ''   `` So why am I surprised that the people in charge of this country decide to *play* with me ? ! ''   `` Well.. because they are n't good at making decisions . ''   `` But ... it 's better for them ? ''   `` ... yes . ''   `` Well ... there is no one to even know that ! It is amazing ! ''   `` You 've created a monster just like me.. ''   For the most part , the young man was not entirely lost in the insanity of his rant . He did not realize that he had found a monster , yet someone he knew of whom had once been the leader of the free world . He knew everything about the world around him , and saw everything . He knew everything about his country , and was happy he had succeeded in completing the goal that he 'd always been looking for . He was not so happy that he could not be with the person he knew he was . He could not be with the person that had been responsible for everything- including his beautiful wife .   The young man looked down at his hands with a smile , and began to turn to the woman behind the counter .   `` I 'll be sure to call you after tonight , '' he said , smiling .
This isn ’ t what I expected .   When I arrived at the airport , I was greeted by a man with a very strange face . He didn ’ t seem so out of place , but somehow he was still fairly alert . Once he had finished his initial check , he made his way to the exit , which was at the end of the hallway , which was also a little further in place . He began to walk , until he met the first person he saw in his life .   He was sitting across from him . He wasn ’ t wearing a shirt , but rather an expensive suit ; it revealed several tattoos over his left shoulder . The man was roughly twenty with a very odd nose .   The man smiled but not in some way . “ Excuse me , but are you ready ? ” He asked the stranger .   “ Well , yes , ” the man replied .   The stranger laughed . “ It seems like you are going to be waiting to see me , ” he said calmly .   The man smiled back , but did not seem amused . “ What does that mean ? ”   “ You will have to wait for me , ” the stranger said .   The man smiled at him . “ I ’ m not afraid of wait . I ’ m a good guy. ”   The man laughed , but did not seem pleased . “ Please don ’ t worry ! Just wait. ”   The man paused . “ Why not go ahead and meet me ? ”   The traveler was beginning to feel uneasy . “ Oh , don ’ t worry that I ’ ll never come into your world , ” he said .   The man smiled again . “ Ok , but first , I ’ ll not hurt you . I ’ ll just ask you a question ; what does this mean ? ”   The man did not respond , but instead looked at the stranger and asked , “ Do you know who I am ? ”   The man looked at the stranger . “ You , ” he answered .   “ … Who are you ? ”   The man looked at the stranger and asked , “ Who am I ? ”   “ I am *my* boss . I need to get started foraging. ”   The man looked at the man and asked , “ What do you mean ? ”   The man ’ s mouth moved , but didn ’ t move . He sat there , confused . When the man reached out , it came out as a thin paper bag .   “ I need your help . Please , ” he said .   The man looked at the bag and looked at the bag again . He looked at the words , “ Help me. ”   The man looked at the bag and looked at the word , “ Help me. ” 
* '' Oh hey John ! `` *   John looked at the pale , wrinkled figure slowly across from him .   `` Hey , no . ''   The tall , bearded man sat down on the plush , wooden floor .   John looked across the floor to the pale , wrinkled body of the man .   He held his hand out to John to walk over .   `` Hi John . ''   John took the hand , and felt the cold , hard , flesh against his cheek .   `` Um ... ''   He shook his head slowly .   `` Sorry John . ''   The pale , wrinkled man stared at John with a cold , indifferent expression .   The tall , bearded man stared back at John .   John coughed violently .   `` Ow ! ''   John collapsed to the floor and vomited .   * '' Wow , man ! `` *   John was met with the same cold stare .
The reporter , `` Mr . Jones ? ''  `` Yes , it is . ''  `` Good . Go on then , please . ''  I stared at it like a deer in headlights . `` So , tell us very different from the rest of you . ''   The reporter , `` What do you mean ? ''  `` This was just one of your many disasters , of course , but now everyone has been infected . Everyone has been cured , of course . ''   I went silent for a moment . `` What 's that about ? ''   The reporter , `` Well , our reporter is talking about some news in his news channel . Tell us about how you survived this day , Mr Jones . ''   The reporter spoke much louder than any other reporter in the world . It sounded like all the other reporters were talking . Even the ones who had n't been infected .   `` So , what happened ? ''   `` Well , he went outside . His wife left him . They came back , and he was the only one left . She came back in a red gown , and he was bitten . He shot himself . ''   `` So , what happened after that ? ''   `` Well , they put him in danger , and they had him run around , and they put him down . They let him in a room , and he was injected ! ''   The reporter . The reporter . The reporter . I could feel the heat radiating through me . `` Mr. Jones , please , tell us about it . ''   `` Well , they put him out of danger . They put him down . They put him in shock and then they put his brain in it and put him in the room . The people in there did n't know what to do , and they did n't want him to suffer . ''   I could feel the heat growing , like the heat was too much . My arm began to numb , and my body began to weaken . My neck began to sting , and my eyes began to go crazy . `` Mr. Jones , you are a very lucky man . You have a family . You have friends . ''   I could only stare back at him in disgust . `` I 'm sorry , but I do n't want them to suffer . I do n't want them to suffer . ''   The reporter finished his sentence , `` Mr. Jones , why are you trying to talk to me ? This is n't right . No , this is n't how it is supposed to be . It was supposed to be like this . ''   `` But I do n't want them to suffer . You said you were a very lucky man . I could do it , and I really am , but I ca n't do it right now . I ca n't live this down . Please , Mr. Jones , listen to me , please . ''   My body began to collapse , and my eyes opened wide , wide with horror . I sat up , my eyes wide . I saw the reporter , the reporter , the reporter , `` You are not right ? ''   I stared at him like a deer in headlights . `` No , I am not . They did n't put me in danger . They put me in danger . And I would give the world a chance to be brave a different way . ''   `` Do I have a choice ? ''   `` No , Mr. Jones . You will have to choose . ''   I sat there paralyzed for a moment . There was a sense of guilt , but I could n't shake it . I saw the reporter , the reporter , the reporter , and I walked on .
Death by accident is usually a memory loss - an inability to remember your own accomplishments , even those of your own great work , in an attempt to make you forget . It is a loss of memory , but one that would likely make you stop at the same time for the rest of your life .    The memory loss is always a loss of memories . You just need to remember how you died . Sometimes the memories you had are just flashes in the distance , a little flash of light , and they carry off . For some reason , it seems like every piece of memory is lost , and nobody ever really talks again , except to someone else . Maybe .    The memory loss is always a loss of memories . Everything , from the way you were born , through your first kiss , or how you spent the course of your life there . It sucks , but you remember it all anyway , so you can remember it all . Even your first birthday present . Even your first birthday present . All the memories you had are real . All the memories you 've made . All the memories you 've saved up over the years . All the pain you 've caused . All the heartache you 've caused . All the tears you 've cried .    And here I am , waiting for death . I can hear his voice . He 's coming for me .    `` ... Hello ? '' I ask politely .    `` I 'm here for you , young one , '' he says , his tone reassuring .    `` Wha- ''    `` The memories I 'm offering you , on your condition , will not last long . You will have to experience the process - they will ensure you will remember them . Do you know how long you have been waiting here ? ''    He looks up . `` I 'm afraid I do not know . I just do n't know . ''    `` Very well . Do you remember ? ''    `` Yes , '' he says .    I watch as he looks at me with a look of disappointment and disappointment . I do n't know what is going on , but I know he cares too much to hear it .    `` Thank you . ''    The memory loss is always a loss of memories .
I sat on my bed and stared at my digital clock screen . It was 4:32 AM . I got up and looked around the room . Everything in the room was asleep . I 'm not sure why . I 've been staring at this for a full three hours now . I wish I could just do what I do , but every time I try to do it for myself , a stupid thought pops into my head .   I wish I could just change things . But why did I think of that . I looked at my phone . I 'm not sure whether it 's 1:30 AM or 1:30 AM . I look at my phone again . It 's 1:46 AM . I feel sick .

It 's 4:53 AM . I ca n't stop thinking about this . This is going to be bad . I pull out my phone and go to bed . It has 3:58 AM . I begin to lay down . I think about what happened yesterday . My mother and I had a baby . We were playing soccer in front of the house . I turned around and saw her smiling .   `` Hello everyone ! How can I help you today , please take off my clothes ! '' She grabbed my arm and held me up in her arms . `` You 're going to have to wear them soon enough ! '' She looked over at me with that look of pity on her face . `` I 'm sorry honey , '' she said with an apologetic smile on her face , `` That 's what happens when people tell you that they want to be sick . ''   I looked at my phone . It 's 2:03 AM . I ca n't stop thinking about this . I 'm not sure what happened yesterday . I look down at my feet while I try to stand . I feel weak . I stumble back to the bed and look into my phone . It 's 2:04 AM . I feel sick again . I put my phone down and lay back down . I 'm not sure why . I decide to take off my clothes . It has 3:00 AM . I look over at my ceiling . It 's 2:05 AM . I think about what happened yesterday . My mother and I had a baby . We were playing soccer in front of the house .

“ Hey , I ’ m out here ! ”   I looked up at my old partner , a pale , wrinkled face with a scarlet skin . He must have been holding the pistol tightly , because of how the others had fallen over . They must have been lucky .   I turned my head around . “ Are you alright ? ” I asked . He remained silent , his eyes searching for something . I was able to pick up a baseball bat . “ Just lost it ! ” I told him . “ I know I ’ ve been trapped here for days . It ’ s been twenty minutes and we can ’ t find anything ! Just go ! ”   He let out a sigh . He ’ d died when we found him . Hell , when we found him . We ’ d been running out of food for a year now .   *Why are they not moving ? * I thought .   I walked towards them , the way I always did . I grabbed a rock and let it fall into my hand . As I made that step , I heard it shatter , followed by a deafening screech . I fell to the ground , confused , but I did so quietly . Surely . I was going to die today !   *Now they know I 've been trapped here* , I thought . *This has to be their mistake at least* .   I stood up , my face turning from concern to determination . I ran to the door , only to notice my hands were still holding the gun .   “ Look , we were just going to be late . We needed to meet up . I ’ ve been going crazy , I ’ m sorry . You know , I didn ’ t mean to disappoint you . But it ’ s okay . We ’ ll meet again tomorrow. ”   I walked over to the doorway , closing it behind me . Even though it was the only way I could go home , I felt a chill run up my spine .   ***   Today I was found in another city , lying inside . I thought I was fine . I thought I was going insane . I tried to get up , but the cold kept hitting me harder , and harder .  I woke up in the hospital bed , my arms wrapped around my chest . I thought I was dead . I thought I was in something awful , but I didn ’ t believe it . I looked around . I saw a man dressed completely in what looked like clothing , but he was holding what looked as a baseball bat , and pointing at his partner .   “ Hey ! ”   The man holding the baseball bat yelled me .   “ What are you doing ? ”   “ What do you want ? ”   “ I just want to see your face. ”   “ Why ? ”   “ I just want to see your face. ”   The man holding the baseball bat pointed at my face .   “ What do you want ? You want us to meet again ? ”   “ I just want to see your face. ”   The man pointed at my face .   “ Why ? ! You want us to meet again ? ”   “ I just want to see your face. ”   The man pointed at my face .   “ What do you want ? ”   “ I just want to see your face. ”   The man pointed at his face .   I started running . I could hear the man yelling at me .   ***   I woke up in the hospital bed , in a hospital bed .   I saw my partner lying on the ground , and began to cry .

I was standing in front of the gallery , staring into the eyes . In the center of the gallery rested three young men , laughing and sharing a drink with each other . The girl between them wore a bright pink dress and was wearing a white dress . She was giggling and her eyes were wide with excitement . I recognized the red glow of her eyes and felt a sense of excitement inside me .  `` Missy , you 're finally here ! May I help you with a moment ? '' I asked , and pointed to the girl in the pink dress . `` Missy , what 's the color of your eyes ? They have yellow '' , I asked .  `` Uh , I think I can see '' , she answered , `` but I do n't know what to do . I 've got some black eyes and lots of blue , all over me . But I do n't know what to do . ''  `` Have y'all gone to sleep , Missy ? ''  `` Yea , definitely '' , she replied , `` but I do n't know how to do this . I 've got some deep blue eyes and lots of red . I do n't know how to do this '' , I said ,  `` Missy , you 're going to have to go to sleep , because if you do n't go to sleep soon , you get ta go to sleep ! ''  `` Well , I was there , just ... .. ''  `` Okay '' , she said , `` I 'll see you around here eventually . '' I smiled , and as I walked away , the girl behind me began to look up at me . With my eyes closed , I started to smile a little , because the girl behind me was going to get really excited about me .
To me , the universe is only a dimly lit field , which is why I am here . On the day I finally go to bed , I feel that a presence is looking at me from a distance , standing in my doorway . It is a short , wiry man in a bright orange suit , which is slightly too thick for his body . He is speaking in a deep , rhythmic voice .   `` I can not explain what was bothering you , sir . ''   `` It 's not quite as if I am a stranger to you . As if I have never seen a stranger before . ''   `` It is not that . I understand that your very presence is not quite as important under any circumstance as it is at today 's current moment . But I have a proposition for you , and I have to ask you : which is why you are in the first place . ''   `` Right . ''   The man walks over to me , and pulls out a large object from an envelope . He begins to lift it up , and a black ball of light falls from the top . The black ball appears to be made of gold , which is perhaps brighter than my own .   `` This is called the ‘ Universe Reactor. ’ The ball is made of a material similar to metal , which I am not very familiar with . It is made of some sort of copper that is likely a rare mineral . In fact , the object is named after a demon , who has been trapped in a shell of pure gold for thousands of years . I have been waiting for you , to rescue my demon and bring him to the ground . When you arrive , I will return to my home . However , due to the circumstances , you must obey me . So , let me make you a offer . ''   The man picked up his keys and walked off , leaving the man to it alone .   As he left , I began to pick up a piece of paper and began to write a note . The paper began to read :  Dear Mr. Fennel ,   I know that it 's been a long time since I have met you , and since you 've become a friend I want to see you again . I know that you do n't like me .   However , today is not a day you see . We go to the hospital . As I say , I 'm sorry that I ca n't see you . But you have survived .   Sincerely , yours ,   Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel    Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel   Mark Fennel   The ball of light shot out of the top and onto the ground . I could see the demons soul , as well as the man 's soul . I knew that this is n't a dream , but after all , this is real . I knew I was dreaming , too .   I began to write another note before the ball of light shot out of the top and onto the ground . I placed it on the ground next to me , and , for some reason , I started to weep .   The demon was still standing next to me , as well as Mark . He had many horns on his head . His mouth was crooked , and he was wearing a strange suit . He was also wearing a strange helmet . He was walking along the ground . I was terrified .   The demon went into the center of the room , and sat down with a huge pile of earth . The man began to scratch at his skin , and when he finished , he began to write something on a piece of paper .   `` This is it ? ''   `` Yes . This is the perfect solution . ''   `` And it looks like it has worked ! ''   `` Yes , sir , it has . I have also written the note , along with an explanation as well . ''   `` What 's really that supposed to mean ? ''   Mark took out an object from his suit . It was a large object that looked like an object of some sort . It was also shaped like a ball of gold .   `` This is a letter . ''   `` A letter , sir ? ''   `` Uh , yes , I am sure . I am not sure of how to describe it
Odd .   The bottle .   I checked the label again , the note in the middle of the bottle reading , `` I wish for the greatest gift ever . ''   Still , it was n't mine . I was a lawyer , I did n't intend for my clients to hear me make them ...   Wait . What ? Why ? Why was n't I in the family room ?   I opened an album , which I found sitting on the floor . It was a photograph of my mother , a rather ugly woman .   Why ? Why did I have to kill her ?   There was a note on the cover , `` Remember that you 're going to give your father an award . ''   I stared at it , wondering if I should do it . Maybe I should make my mother angry , and go kill her . To be honest , I kind of hoped that it would be a lie .   What if I told her I killed my father ?   I looked at the photo again . The picture was from my mother and I . I knew I did n't kill my family , but I did n't want to .   Why was n't everyone here ?   I got out of the ambulance , and went to my room . I was going to write my note on my desk , it would be my last thing on the front .   This letter is not mine .
The door opens as my father slides in .   `` Hey dad , you ready ? ''   `` Yes . Be ready . ''   `` Good . Let 's get started . ''   `` Alright , great . Let 's get started . ''   My father walks over to a machine that looks like a keyboard .   `` You 'll be in position at the top . Have a good day . ''   My father sits back .   `` Hmmm . Well ... see you in a while . ''   I sit down and start typing .   Before I can finish I hear them . At first it is quiet , I can hear them being carried out . Then I hear whispers .   `` Hey now , hey now , let 's start ... ''   I type .   `` The name is K- ''   `` K-K-K-K-K-k-K-K-K-K . ''   Suddenly a loud thud echoed in the room .   `` K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   I type .   `` Oh my . Okay . Okay . Lets start . ''   The thud echoed louder .   `` Alright . ''   `` Hey now , K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   `` K-K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   The thud echoed away .   `` Okay . What are we doing here ? ''   It now sounded like my father yelling . I typed with the keyboard in my hands and started typing and typing .   The shouts began to get louder .   `` K-K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   I typed .   `` K-K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   `` K-K-K-K- K-K-K-K-K . ''   Finally I typed .   `` K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   I typed .   `` K-K-K-K-K-k-K . ''   `` K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   Each sound sounded like my father telling my how things are . Each sound sounded like my father telling me how he needs to be there to keep me safe . The thud came closer .   `` K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   `` K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K . ''   Then the screams stopped .   They stopped .   `` J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J . ''   I typed .   `` J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J . ''   I typed .   `` J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J . ''   I typed .   `` J-J-J-J-J- j-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J . ''   The thud was so loud it was deafening . Suddenly my father 's voice ran through the entire house , `` J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J . ''   `` J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J . ''   I typed .   `` J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J
I just watched him walk through the park . He kept walking , and that was that . It wasn ’ t until we were about 2 park blocks away that I realized he didn ’ t seem to notice me . I leaned in and kissed him on the back . He looked at me with wide eyes and said , “ Yes , I trust you. ”   We both embraced harder . As did my heart . I never spoke to anyone about how I felt before .   He looked at me and said , “ I know. ”   With great strength , I lifted him up and hugged him against the railings of the bench . We hugged ever so slightly.As we stood up , I grabbed his hands in mine and gently rocked him back and forth .   He spoke one moment and said , “ You can ’ t be serious. ”   I pulled him up and kissed him on the back again .   As soon as we stood there , he looked at me with wide eyes and said , “ Yes , I trust you. ”
I loved her so much .   I was n't quite sure why I loved her so much . I was n't sure what she was going to make of me . When I was a young boy , I was n't sure what I would do with her , or what she would do for me . But I was determined to keep her . I was determined to keep her warm .   When I was a teenager , I was n't sure what I would do with her , and what I would do with her . I was ready to do anything and everything I could to make her warmth , even if she was n't really my girl . She was my girl .   But when I was a teenager , I was n't sure what I would do with her . When I was a teenager , I was n't sure what I would do with her . When I was a teenager , I was n't sure what I would do with her . When I was a teenager , I was n't sure what I would do with her . When I was a teenager , I was n't sure what I would do with her . Then it hit me that I could never just go with her .   But as I grew older , I was n't sure what I would do with her . I was n't sure what I would do with her . I was n't sure what I would do with her .   Finally , at 18 , I was n't sure what I would do with her . I was n't sure where I would be going with her . I was n't sure what I would do with her . But I was determined to keep her warm .   When I was a young teenager , I was n't even sure what I would do with her . I was n't sure where I would be going with her . But I was determined to keep her warm .   I was determined to keep her warm .   When I was a teenager , I was n't sure what I would do with her . I were n't sure what would make her warm , even if she was n't really my girl . I was n't sure what would do with her .   I know I 'm not sure what I would do with her .   But I am determined to keep her warm .   I am determined to keep her warm .   The first thing I do is find a new way to keep her warm .   At first , I considered suicide . I considered suicide . I considered suicide . But I was never sure what I would do with her . I was only sure that if I did n't kill her , all of her warmth would be consumed ! All of her warmth would melt away !   But then ... she was gone .
He stood there waiting for this moment . He knew it would come soon . He knew that the moment that was coming would end fast and the moment would n't hurt . He walked over to the railing and took one last pull of the ledge .   But it never did . He was n't prepared for the feeling of water flowing around in front of him . The weight of the moment felt like a weight on his shoulders . He felt his heart beat as if it were going to stop . He stopped . He could n't breathe . He almost wanted to scream but he refused to . He took a moment to compose himself and calm down .   He finished himself off with a sigh and then stood up , taking another pull off the ledge he had been standing on . He knew it would n't hurt .   `` Hey , dude . '' A man who was shouting had stood up from the edge . He was wearing a raincoat and a matching pair of black boxer shorts . `` Hey , man . ''   The man looked at the person in front of him . He had a kind look to he had seen countless times before .   The man looked around him . He was n't alone .   `` Hey , dude . '' The man in front of him was holding a brown suitcase . `` Can you tell me why you 're here ? ''   The man in front of him suddenly started to flinch . `` When people talk about me , they talk about what they should do with me . '' He looked down and noticed two people on the ground .   The man in front of him turned and looked away .   `` Who are you ? '' He asked .   The man in front of him turned and looked as if he might actually see the man who had spoken . His mouth was open . But there were no sounds . Just some soft gasps . The man in front of him turned back to look at him . He had just enough time to grab his suitcase and run . The man was n't going to let go of his suitcase . He did n't really have any time . Instead , he looked from side to side . He pointed at the people beside him . They were walking on the bridge . The man looked down and saw a few more of the people making their way through the crowd .   The man in front of him turned the suitcase around and pulled out a knife . `` What do you have for me , dude ? ''   The man in front of him looked back and saw the knife still lying on his chest . He grabbed it and swung it out from under him .   The man in front of him dropped the knife and pointed directly at the crowd . He looked at the crowd again and there were no sound . No movement . Just a gentle hum . He lunged at the crowd and grabbed the knife , sinking it into their back . He put the knife back in the suitcase and walked to the edge of the dock behind the crowd . He felt his body drop and turn cold . A piece of paper fell off his chest .   He looked at it .   `` Oh shit . '' He jumped back and stared at the paper .   `` What ? '' He looked down at it again . `` What the hell am I talking about ? ''   He picked up the paper and stared at it . He looked out across the bridge and saw a man on the hood of the cab . He started to walk away .   The man in front of him turned and looked at the paper .   *At least I still have to finish this story . And I hope it 's okay . *
A man with a jet black hood and a hoodie was standing on the bridge of the abandoned train station . What he saw shocked him to the core . As he turned to face the approaching train conductor he realized the entire reason he was standing there was because the train had been abandoned years ago .   He opened his eyes and saw a body lying on the ground , it was n't human . It was a young girl .   *What the hell am I doing here ? Who the hell am I ? Who the hell am I ? *   `` Excuse me , sir , '' said the girl . Her eyes were full of tears .   `` I need help , '' he said from behind the girl .   `` I understand why this is happening to you , young lady , '' said the girl .   She quickly looked around and saw the face of Mr. Brown , standing behind the train . You could tell Mr. Brown was upset .   `` I 'm sorry , Ms . Brown , '' he said .   Ms. Brown turned and faced him , tears streaming down her cheeks .   `` It 's okay . I know that Mr. Brown is angry , but he 's just going too far . I 'm ok. I got ta see him at the end of this . I want him to know that I love him , and not be afraid . I love him . ''   `` Please answer me . Get to the car . I need you to go to the hospital . ''   All of a sudden Mr. Brown knew everything about the girl . He knew her name , her parents , her friends , her favorite books , her favorite video games , her favorite movies , and her favorite anime . He knew the reason he was standing there . He knew the reason he was not standing there . He knew *everything* .   The train began to move rapidly . Mr . Brown could feel it coming , he could feel the weight on the train , and the weight on Mr. Brown .   `` It 's okay , Ms . Brown , '' Mr. Brown said . He looked back down at the body of the young girl and saw her hair was missing .   `` I 'm OK , sweetie , '' said Mr. Brown .   `` Please , call 911 . I 'm trying to help . There 's a train coming . ''   Suddenly a train doors opened and a man with jet black hood and a hoodie stepped into the corridor . Mr. Brown 's eyes opened wide and he stared into Mr. Brown 's face . After what felt like an eternity , he swallowed .
My heart pounds like an iron drum , my breath comes in short bursts and I am unable to stop it . What little I can manage is to continue in front of the stage , only I can see her , she is so beautiful , beautiful , and that same beauty leaves the walls of my apartment . And why is her lovely smile so real ? Why is she so flawless ?   I should have been able to stop her , but I was too lazy to do that . I got into a fight with a boy I loved one night and when I got to him , I was fighting a bit too hard not to feel proud . At one point , I was crying and I looked at him . He was smiling , he was so beautiful ! I would have loved to punch him in it . But I knew I had to do it , I knew it would be the last blow I would ever make .   I know now that I should have been able to stop her , I am too lazy to do that . But I am so perfect ! I could have gotten him to stop me , but I am so perfect ! I could have beaten the boy , picked him up and threw him to the ground , but I am so perfect ! Even then , I wish I did n't have to do that .   Someone called me a hit man , and I have failed ? Maybe this is a test ? Maybe this is what life has to offer ?   I was going to the funeral with my best friend , and I had failed . But I did n't think it was bad , but I am so perfect . Maybe I am the great hit man , maybe I am the great hit man , but I am so perfect . Why does she miss me ? Why is it so hard to do that ?   `` Hey , '' I say to a crowd of people , `` what are you doing ? ''   I can see that someone is looking at me . I am too lazy to do that . They are going to die , and if I do , they will die too .   `` I do n't know , '' I say , `` but I can tell you it is very lonely here , and I am tired as hell . ''   I look at the crowd again , and I am tired of watching them die . I think of my family , my friends , my dreams , their relationships .   And what is that feeling of loneliness ? What is that feeling of depression ?   `` I need to know , '' I say , `` how do you feel ? ''   I look away from the crowd .   `` Why does n't anyone notice me ? '' I ask .   `` Because I do n't want to die . ''   `` Let me out , '' I say , `` let me tell you . You are really young and old . You have such a strong imagination , and you can play games with your imagination , and you can create incredible things . ''   `` Would you like to die ? ''   `` I do n't know what to do . ''   `` Why would you want to die ? ''   `` I do n't know . I want to go to heaven . ''   `` Why would you want to die ? ''   `` Because I want to have a fun , you know ? ''   I look at the crowd again . Those people , people ! They are still smiling , they are still crying , they are still smiling .   `` You know . ''   `` Why would you want to die ? ''   `` Because I do n't know either . ''   `` Why would you want to die ? ''   `` Because I want to see grandpa again . ''   I look at the crowd again . They are already smiling . They are still laughing , they are still smiling .   `` Why would you want to die ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Would you want to die ? ''   `` Is this what I have learned ? ''   `` Because I am so good at what I do . You are so good at what I do . ''   `` Why would you want to die ? ''   `` I have learned too much . ''   `` Why would you want to die ? ''   `` Because I have learned much . I will live again . ''   She picks up her purse , she leaves the room , and walks outside .
How could he have been so ignorant ? So ignorant to what must be done ? The man continued to talk , he said nothing and he knew nothing .   His child was only two years old . An adult , maybe two , but not quite like them . He was still young . Had he ever once spent a weekend with his parents ? Did he ever ? He told his sweet , innocent child to listen to him , but she could not hear .   She would not . He knew why , but he did not know why . He had lived in a past life , and he supposed that the young man was not responsible for his child .   The teenager replied , `` He was only thirteen years old . ''   He was wrong . The man continued to talk , and spoke that he was only thirteen years old .   He could n't be so ignorant that the child would not listen to him . He would not hear what must be done .   The man looked into his daughter 's eyes . She knew nothing .   He stood on the sidewalk , and walked away . He never ever walked again .
The rain was unrelenting but it was not so as a formality . The men dressed in a grey tunic and vest marched behind , their guns and their bows resting on their shoulders . Only moments before , The Duke had sent men to kill him and kill him one by one . Only one remained .   A man dressed like himself stood before the King , dressed in a simple brown dress . He wore a simple white white tunic with gold trim on it . His hair was long and his plain face , rich with scars and greasy white skin . His beard was a bright blue , while his eyes were black .   The Duke waited for the manila envelope to arrive before walking slowly towards the King . He opened it and read :   `` Father , we regret to inform you that we have killed you . We do not have your bounty or your castle . We have not stolen your goods . Your wife , you and your children and your father seem to be in a tight situation . We do not wish to harm you .   I am sorry to inform you that our orders have been delivered out of compliance with your requests . Our lordship has been slain by a man named Dr. Robert Kollock . He has been employed in an oil production company that is involved in the murder of every single man in your kingdom . The King has ordered his men to kill Dr. Robert Kollock . We will not give the men any chances to escape .   Your Majesty , we have a full pardon for the crime of murdering Dr. Robert Kollock . The crime has been done long enough . This has allowed us to accept your bounty as our own .   Your majesty , we have to kill Dr. Robert Kollock before the Queen gets to you . We will accept you back to the castle at once , but we promise you we will not harm you . We ask you again .   Your Majesty , we wanted to kill the man named Dr. Robert Kollock . We wanted to stop him and start giving his life to his country . You were too weak to do this . I understand it was your choice , but I wish to change it now .   Your Majesty , we would like to stop you both from your war now . You have the right to live our lives as we please . We will not have to kill Dr. Robert Kollock while we are away .   Your Majesty , we wish to kill Dr. Robert Kollock before the Queen gets to you .   Your Majesty , we would love to kill Dr. Robert Kollock once again . I understand the anger of you , but it will be in your best interest to do that . If you ca n't keep your promise , we will kill you again .   Your Majesty , we wish to remove the men from your lands and leave them with no chance to live your life but to kill Dr. Robert Kollock . ''
I woke up this morning with the same look on my face . `` Fuck '' I uttered . `` Fuck shit shit fuck shit '' I took a deep whiff , then held it in my mouth . This had been the last time I tried to swallow anything . I choked twice and tried to keep my mouth shut but as I looked around I could n't see the sun .   I got up and walked up to my bathroom . This had been on the tv , only slightly different . No change . I walked back into the room , put on my suit and walked out . As I walked back into the house , I noticed a man eating some chicken in my house .   `` Shit '' I muttered . `` Goddamnit '' I ran to my front door and opened it .  `` Hello '' said the man in the hat . `` Who are you ? '' I asked .   `` Welcome to the world of your reality . '' said the man behind the counter .   `` Is that my real name ? '' I asked .   `` No , that 's my real name and that 's my name . I 'm dead '' the man said .   I stood there dumbfounded for a second .   `` This is n't happening '' said the man behind the counter . He pushed me down and started laughing .   `` This is n't happening , this is n't me '' I said .   I started crying , the man behind the counter laughed again .   `` How dare you ! You 're taking my body ! ''   I stood there dumbfounded just like that . As I walked past the counter , I saw the man behind the counter look around at the people around him .   `` Who are you ? '' asked the man behind the counter .   `` What ? '' I said . `` Who are you ? ''   `` Welcome to your reality . ''
If only there were a way . This was it . The day would come . Princess Serinna was finally coming to terms with her fate . She would become a hero .   She approached the castle doors . What an honor to greet her . This might seem like so much to her now . But there was a knock at the door .   `` Come again , Serinna ? '' the woman asked as she opened the door for Serinna . It was as if she was expecting to find her beloved . Serinna was n't expecting to find her beloved .   `` H-hi , princess Serinna ! '' Serinna asked as she saw a tall , slender man waiting for her .   `` Why do n't you help me ? I 'm an adventurer . ''   `` Whoah , h-highness ! I 'm here only to rescue your daughter ! '' Serinna exclaimed as she entered the throne Room .   `` Hey , how about we go outside to eat some dinner ! '' The tall man asked as he walked to Serinna . Serinna looked stunned , she had never thought he would be a threat to her .   `` We 're going to go inside to eat , SerINna ! We 're going to save your little princess ! ''   Serinna was in shock as the tall man smiled , `` Oh , no no , no no , no no no no ... '' Serinna began to cry as the man handed her a plate of food .   `` Can I come out ? I 'm starving ! '' Serinna screamed as her eyes began to close .   `` Why not ? I need you to be strong and brave , Serinna ! You will save her ! ''   `` Not yet , '' Serinna whispered as she began to cry .   `` Serinna , I 've been waiting for you ! I 've been waiting for you for years ! ''   `` Oh , no , no , no no NO ! '' Serinna gasped as she began to cry . She did n't have any idea what to do with herself . Oh , it has to be done . But where did she go wrong , she thought . Maybe it 's her destiny , maybe it is . She would change the world .   After a few minutes Serinna opened her eyes but saw nothing . She went to the throne room and began to cry . Her eyes finally closed .   Serinna felt something touching her , a cold hand gently caressing her head . `` Where 's your daughter ? ''   `` She 's at school , '' he said , placing a hand on her shoulder . `` She 's coming to school . ''  
# # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap )   `` So , what does that mean ? '' asked John of the two veterans .   The man to the left was wearing glasses , the other two to the right were holding a cell phone in one hand , and the other was sitting on a chair in the third . Each man was dressed in some sort of strange , bizarre costume that he did n't recognize . The man in the corner was talking to a woman across from him , and the woman in the other was telling him to sit down .   `` You do n't have to do this , we do n't have to . What 's your name ? '' asked John , raising a brow and looking at her .   The woman in the corner seemed to blink in confusion , then looked up at him . `` John ? '' She said with a laugh .   `` John . '' he replied . `` I 'm John Smith . We have a group here for a survivor . ''   `` What the hell about*that* ? '' cried the woman with the laughed .   `` People get into the movies . They 're never scared of it . '' John said in a matter-of-fact tone . He looked at the woman and her eyes widened . `` You know , this is n't a movie . ''   `` It is . They ca n't have it . I swear , I 'll kill every single one of them . '' explained the man in the corner . `` I 'll kill them and use them to get away . ''   The woman with the laughing turned and walked away . John looked at the group and said , `` We do n't have to kill each other . ''   John of the two veterans turned and walked away .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` What ... what did you do to deserve this ? '' suggested Tom , sitting on a bushel of people .   `` I did it because I enjoyed it . '' replied Tom . `` Then I got bored . ''   `` You 're kidding ? '' Asked Sam , standing on the corner of a bus .   `` Yes . '' answered Tom . `` I enjoyed it . ''   `` You 're trying to say that , are n't you ? '' asked John of the two veterans . `` So , how *did* you do it , then ? ''   Sam shrugged and stood on the curb of the bus . `` I tried to help people , but the people I helped were just too scared to get help . ''   The two veterans looked at each other for a moment , then shrugged their shoulders . `` So , you 're trying to say that , are n't you ? ''   Sam shrugged again . `` I do n't want anybody else to find out , because they do n't have to try . ''   `` So , how did you do it , then ? '' asked Tom . `` I do n't know . ''   `` Well , we actually did it . '' answered Sam . `` We actually did it . ''   `` Why were they afraid of it ? '' asked John of the two veterans .   `` They made me do it . I could n't resist . They made me do it . '' said Sam . `` I created a monster out of pure fear . ''   `` You made it do anything to help people , Tom ? '' asked Tom .   `` Yes , I created it . '' replied Sam .   `` You made it do anything to kill people ? '' asked John of the two veterans . `` Oh , right . ''   `` Did you do anything to get people to believe that the monster was real ? '' asked John of the two veterans .   `` No . '' replied Sam .   `` Are you sure you want to continue ? '' asked Tommy .   `` Well , I wanted to be the one who made the monster do anything to help people . '' said John of the two veterans .   `` Is that really what you want ? '' asked Tom of the two veterans .   `` Absolutely . '' replied John of the two veterans .   `` I-I think you do n't remember ? '' asked Sam .   `` No
We came from a planet no one had ever seen , with the planet . It appeared as if it had never happened before , and we had never expected any visitors to this planet . `` Must we be mistaken , '' I thought , `` these people have come to claim our planet . ''   It took two centuries , but we have all heard of the rumors . Darth Vader himself was a true leader . He had ruled the Empire for a century , and was more powerful than any other Emperor . We heard that Vader was just as powerful as Vader , and feared for his people . We heard that he was the key to restoring order . And that is why we returned to the ship . We started the engines .   We are the last survivors of that planet . We are our only hope . We live in a derelict ship . We will find the others soon .
*If only it was n't for this stupid phone . *   She never really understood why people were doing this . The government took control of the world over 5 years ago , and people took control of the people around them and kept improving . They even took control of the entire population . Of course , they did n't just take control over anyone .   Who does n't hate them ?   When I was younger , my father came up with a plan . He told me that we had to take over the world , so that everybody 's jobs would be easier . He was right ; people were n't getting the jobs they deserved . They were getting to sit on a roof or work at a company because of this . And they were getting to live out their lives , all without their responsibilities .   What he had to say was that it meant that we could n't take control of ourselves . It meant that we were going to live a good life , and that we would have the freedom to go where we wanted to go . So on , that 's what they did . He had to say that it meant that what they did was right .   And that was true .   *Why did those phones always think of me as their bitch ? *   She did n't know about the whole thing , and she did n't know that our actions had to be taken for good . She had to say that it was the right way to live , so that everyone would be happier .   Why did n't they take control of the world ?   She did n't know about the whole thing either .   *Why did they always think of me like that ? *   She did n't know what the truth was .   She did n't know what the truth was .   *And why did n't they get to live like this ? *   It was n't fair . The government had to have me do what they wanted . It was n't how they planned it .   That 's why I did what I hated most .   *I hate it . *
The news started about ten years ago . Being alive a long time ago made it even worse . The media began to pick up the story , and it got worse . I was at a local cafe near New York City , eating my lunch . The newspaper was showing an old man who was in his late thirties smiling as he smiled back . 'Oh hey man , I was wondering if someone else would be able to see you ? ' I laughed , thinking that he was probably that big of a deal .   I took a sip of my coffee as the man continued . 'Listen , I figured it would be interesting to see a little more from here . We need to talk about something . ' He glanced at me , as if I was some kind of crazy old bastard . 'Great ... what do you think we should talk about ? ' His smile quickly faded to a frown , and he continued . 'I think that we should talk about something . '   I raised my eyebrows , and grinned . 'I do n't think I can hear you , you 're only breathing . ' I paused for dramatic effect , and looked at the newspaper . It was showing this man 's face , as though he was trying to hide from me . 'Oh , yeah . I think that 's when it hit me . ' He began tapping at the paper . 'I think that 's when it hit me . '   I looked at the paper . It was a picture of a man , as though he were walking along . He turned around slowly , and smiled at me . 'Hey , maybe you could make a picture ? ' He pointed at his newspaper . 'I am trying to tell you a story that everyone has heard of . People have actually seen you . ' He tapped at the paper again , and smiled . 'Is it true that you have seen people ? ' He turned around to get a closer look at me , and smiled again . 'Yeah , that does n't happen often . '   I turned around and went into the living room . I got a pizza and sat down in front of the TV . I watched the news intently , watching the man go on about how his life is all about being alive .   As he finished , I noticed that the reporter was watching the man . 'It is not quite how everyone thinks it is . People are not born in rural China , and can not live off of food . However , there is something about your eyes . It is the most beautiful thing about them . They are constantly the most perfect , and they can be seen through you . They are the most pure and pure , and it is what drives us to love . ' He leaned in to me , and whispered his long , deep voice . 'There is no love ? There is no emptiness . The same way everyone loves , and nobody can see it . ' I turned to my television , and watched a live version of the man in the picture . 'You see , yes , that 's what you have been saying . You are the most pure and pure . Remember this ? Remember how you know that the only way to get home is by knowing that what you see is amazing ? If you can live without knowing what you see , you can live without knowing how to find happiness . ' I looked to my right , to my left , to the newspaper . 'It is a miracle ! There are no negative aspects of yourself that are true . You love happiness . You are a very full and loving being , and you are living the dream . ' I turned to my right , to the newspaper . 'It is true that all of us are full and loving . ' I turned back to the reporter . 'Thank you so much . ' he sat down at his computer . 'Are you sure of that ? ' 'I think so . ' I looked at my phone . 'It is more than that . ' I got up , walked out the door , and walked back to my apartment . I felt a bit confused as to what exactly I was doing , but I was not sure . I walked for a couple minutes , trying to remain calm . I came home , and looked at my phone . 'Call me later . ' I clicked send and waited for my answer .   I waited a few minutes longer at the door , and waited a few more minutes before I answered . 'Hey ! Hello ? ' I asked , curious . 'Of course , come in . ' My answer must have been no surprise . 'I just wanted to hear if you want to know how to live without knowing what you see is amazing . ' I handed him a key , and walked inside .   As I walked in , I was surprised to see that my husband was sitting there reading his newspaper . 'Oh , hello , I 'm actually sorry to tell you that

I woke up early , put on a pair of clothes ( like my mom did ) and got dressed . Then my eyes lit up , and a bright light flashed in my peripheral . `` Good morning Dave '' I yelled , not bothering to look at the source of the noise .   The light illuminated a large silhouette on the ground , in front of me . `` Good morning Dave '' it answered .   `` I 'm Dave , are n't I ? '' I asked , still not bothered to look at the figure .   `` Why yes Dave , you are '' it answered . `` Now I 'm going to kill you here , right ? ''   `` Yes Dave '' I answered .   `` How ? ''   `` You know what ? I have a solution to this problem . ''   `` No , no ! ''   `` Fine , I 'll kill you now , and no more fighting . Then you could join me , and we could go back and save one day ! ''   `` So what do you mean ? ''   `` It 's possible to go back in time and do this . ''   `` I 'll go back in time and save one day ! ''   `` So what do you want me to do ? ''   `` Well , the first thing I ask is , what do I do ? ''   `` I 'll do anything . ''   I was met with a flash of light .   `` That 's it ? No more fighting ? '' Dave asked .   `` That 's it ! ''   I was sent back to my room as the light again flashed in my peripheral .   `` Good morning Dave '' it said . `` Come on in , I 'll show you ''
It was on such a Tuesday afternoon as the wife was driving down the sidewalk . There were no signs of danger in the area - no pedestrians walking past- nobody even bothered to check if she was in a hurry or not to be spotted . Then , it happened . The wife turned around and was face Tock , the man who was driving the cruiser . Tock never had anyone so busy- except today . On this boring Tuesday afternoon , and today 's morning routine , he was just driving the cruiser . However , this morning , tock had planned on leaving . He figured with what happened this afternoon , he had no reason to stop , so instead he went up the street and picked up a small bag of groceries by the side of his vehicle .   `` Hey Mike , ''   `` What 's that ? ''   `` I 'm sorry , sir . It 's a big bag of groceries . ''   `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` Sorry , sir . It 's . . . a big . . . . bag of groceries . . ''   `` Where are you going ? '' Mike blurted out , clearly annoyed now .   `` This job , it 's for a human . ''   `` Of course ! You 're not the first . No , I 'm not . It 's . . . right here . ''   `` Oh ! I 'm sorry . Well , if I can get it , that does n't matter where I can get it . Just . . . here . ''   `` Come on . What the hell ? ''   `` I 've got ta get it . I mean , I *have* to get it , but you 're just not the first . You have to get it . ''   `` Fine . But you have to get it . What 's a second one worth ? ''   `` Um- okay . I-I think . . um . . I just thought . . I like the way this does n't sound bad . ''   `` Then why are n't you just trying to get it ? Because that 's not what you want to do , so I'm- ''   `` I want to be a doctor ! '' Mike exclaimed as he felt the weight of the groceries falling off of his shoulder . It felt like a very bad idea to take them off of his shoulders . But how could he really be so stubborn ?   `` I-I 'm aneurysm . I just want to be a doctor . A doctor ! ''   He felt his head loll back to the side . He just wanted to get the gun out of his back pocket . And just how could he be so stubborn ?   `` Okay , you see . I 'm driving this cruiser because I have a family . I just want to be an astronaut . There 's no way I 'm going to be an astronaut . ''   `` And your wife is still in college ? ''   `` Yes . I 'm at the University of Dallas . ''   `` I know the building . ''   `` Yes . ''   `` I see ! What do you wish for ? ''   `` I wish to be a doctor . ''   `` This is n't the first time you 've had that . ''   `` The next time you 've used that . ''   `` Well , sir ! That 's not how this works ! I wish for people to give me that shot . I wish for people to get it . I wish for people to say that I 'm so brave that I can live the rest of my life here ! ''   `` I 'm not brave . I 'm not brave enough . I 'm not brave enough not to kill men and women . I 'm not brave enough not to tell anyone and I just want to be a good little hero . ''   `` I just want to be a doctor . There 's no man or woman in the world that can provide a good little hero . ''   `` Now , please . Please get it . '' What could possibly go wrong ? `` I just want it . ''   `` Can you take this rifle out of your back pocket ? ''   `` No , sir . It 'll take me a second to pull the trigger . ''   `` What do you mean , sir ? ''   `` You can take this shotgun out of your back pocket . ''  
I could n't just let him die . I mean , there was the time after the world ended . We were both watching as our city burned to the ground and the rest of the world fell . The world was just beginning to fall away . The world was starting to fall apart . We were slowly building . Soon enough , I was standing in front of the stage . I looked at the crowd , they looked at me , and they looked at me . Tears streamed down my face .   She was finally there . I looked as I looked at her . I saw all the pain in her eyes . Her husband was dead , and just like that , everything was black .   She was still there .
Another day of work , another day of my life . It 's only ever been a few minutes , since my wife left my life.The moment I knew she was gone , everything changed . I took to taking my left hand off my ear and made sure I could still hear the music . I made sure to breathe in the sweet scent of the forest , as I waited for my wife to return . I waited for her to leave . I waited for her to walk out the front door , and I waited for her to hold the door shut for the last time . But nothing . Nothing… nothing . Nothing .   I had known this day would come . It was a part of the life I lived , a part of the beautiful life that ended when a gunshot rang out . Then the noise slowed down . The man ’ s eyes widened in horror , then he stumbled to the ground , dropping his head as the bullet went through his chest . His throat was instantly dry , but his tongue remained still , and a few blood spurted out when his vision cleared . He woke up , a mess of blood and blood covering him . He looked up , and in his eyes , he saw the same grin on his face as the man standing before him .   “ You won ’ t be able to see me again. ”   He opened his mouth , but nothing came out . The beautiful sound of music had gone out . He couldn ’ t hear it , but the same smile had faded . The entire world around him started to blacken . All of time had stopped flowing… It was all white…   He collapsed to the earth . His mind was a blur . His ears still ringing . The darkness around him was nothing more than a blur . The only sound that he could hear was the sound of music , and the softness of the trees outside .   He looked down , and saw a forest . Just like the forest he wanted to leave too . 
I waited for the show to start , but the show ended without a hitch . I was not a celebrity , I was not a magician . I was nothing more than a tool to entertain the masses . I was the greatest show of my time . This was the show , nothing more than a glorified circus , filled with such ridiculous people they had thought I would be unstoppable .   When the lights dimmed and the host left , I was a simple illusionist , but I knew that this show was not going to succeed . I was going to make a show of it .   I am a natural magician , but I was not . Nobody wants to see a magician without seeing a magician . People want to see a magician without knowing where they are . People want to feel an overwhelming , overwhelming feeling of weightlessness and nothing but an empty bottle of wine . People want to see a magician without knowing where it smells .   I walked away from the stage , leaving an empty bottle in my hand . I was going to show this trick to the world .   But I was not prepared . I knew that I had to do this .   I opened my bag and found a bottle of wine . I poured into it and took the first sip . The water tasted like salt and strong , but I could not take it away . I was too tired to remember that my face showed off of my teeth . I was too tired to remember my body , and I could not remember anything else . I could not remember anything else . I was a poor magician , but I knew that I was a waste of time , and I would not allow myself to think of other people . I never wanted to create a perfect scene for the audience to see - I knew this was not real .   I pulled the wine out of my bag and I sat down , resting my face on the glass of wine . I sighed , and looked around . I was alone in this empty house . I knew it must have seen me , because I felt the presence of my own shadow . But I knew that my eyes were dead .   I looked down at my hands , and felt a liquid drain from them . This liquid made me feel like I was drowning , but I was also naked . It started to soak my skin and started to congeal onto my skin . I felt naked in this world .   I looked back at my hands , and looked at the wine which was dripping from my hands . As I stared at my hands , the water started to swim away . My thoughts went to the wine which was flowing out of them , and then back to my hands . I walked back to the stage and sat down next to my illusionist .   `` So , '' I said to myself , `` I decided to show you something . '' and proceeded to walk away .   The wine began to slowly , and slowly , flow away . I could not feel , but I knew that I was going to lose my grip on my life . I placed the wine bottle back into the bag and closed my eyes and let it fall off the table .   I closed them .   In a flash , I was on my knees , sitting in the center of a wooden table . The water was still flowing away , but I could not feel it anymore . I could not feel anything anymore . I sat there in my empty house , staring at the wine .   I was naked , and a flood of water washed over me .   I picked up the wine and started swallowing . I gulped the water , and continued swallowing . I sat down on the wooden table , again , in my empty house , and looked at the wine which was dripping off of my hands . I looked back at my hands , and there was not another part of my body anymore . I looked up and saw my face , and the tears began to roll down my cheeks .   `` Have you thought about what my expression will show you ? '' I asked .   `` Do you guys think I will show you ? ''
I recommend using your word choice . You do a great job covering the top 3 elements of your writing . Although I think you 're a well-planned writer , it does n't seem that you 're doing the right job . I hope that that the decision you make is all what matters .   1 . I 'm not going to lie . I think most of the characters are pretty generic , not just from the same book . The characters are all quite bland , and usually just plain mundane-looking . But that does n't mean the story in any way *has* defined everything . In fact , it does n't change anything about what you 've painted . There 's still a fairly low level of tension in the story , but that 's mostly because the protagonist is just plain ordinary-looking .   2 . You 're going to need better word choice . Without better technique , you would n't be able to differentiate between the characters from the author as well as being the best at what you make them think . That 's why I really recommend using it .   3 . You need more in depth . If you have one of the best ideas in the world , you can see some pretty intense changes in the story . You can also see that the characters are n't just plain ordinary-looking , they 've changed their entire story . They 're moving the world in a way that draws people closer to what they want to see .   4 . A character 's character is n't just plain ordinary-looking , but you also can be influenced by it . But without proper word choice , they would n't necessarily be normal-looking . If you do n't really care , you 'll just have to figure out the best idea to make them feel like they 're not ordinary .   5 . There 's one possibility of changing your world . So get out of this thing .   6 . How many characters do you need ? One of them is special . It 's a very short time limit to a single character , but I was always able to pick one of the generic characters . One of the generic characters would be very unique . Most of the generic characters would be very normal .   7 . Is that the best idea you could have ? You could use it on the main character 's character . If you never did , maybe it would n't be that good . There 's a slight chance that the main character would be very special . If you 're not trying to get the main character in as bad as possible , you have to make sure that the main character has an appropriate word choice .   8 . You may want to use it on the main character 's character , but who knows ? Maybe it 's a very poor choice , but you 'll have to make sure that it 's the best choice .
`` Now ! ''   The President and the Vice President burst out into applause . `` We 've detected a large chunk of ... o *ro coffee* sticking out of the coffeeista ! ''   `` A *raaaaay* coffee ? Hey , it 's not , '' said the Vice President . `` It 's just ... sugar ... with *ro coffee* just everywhere ! ''   `` Yes ! '' exclaimed the President . `` And why ? ! ''   `` Because we do n't have coffee . ''   `` Oh , right ! '' the Vice President swaggered out of the Oval Office and dashed out the door .   The President and the Vice President ran into each other and cried out . `` Oh , good heavens , '' murmured the Vice President .   The President walked up to the Vice President and asked , `` How long until you have the *ro coffee* ? ''   `` A minute ! ''   `` Well , how long do we have ? ''   `` A twenty ? ''   `` What ? ''   The Vice President dropped the phone to the floor . `` A twenty , '' he said .   `` How long do you have ? ''   `` Oh , thirty-five ! Have you been drinking coffee ? ''   `` I 've been drinking my coffee ! '' the President bellowed .   `` So we have n't finished yet , '' added the Vice President .   `` Yes , of course we have , '' said the Vice President . `` How 's that thing working ? ''   `` I 've been drinking , '' the Vice President answered .   `` So what are you eating ? ''   `` I ... ''   `` So what 's eating ? ''   `` Oh , I want some organic organic beverage , '' said the Vice President .   `` Alright , good ! Here you go , '' said the President .   `` Are you sure you want it ? ''   `` I ... just want it ... ''   `` Okay , good ! ''   The President and the Vice President stormed out of the Oval Office and into each other and cried out . `` What ... ''   `` A twenty ! That 's ... not enough ! ''   `` Great ! '' said the President . `` Let 's go ! ''   ******   More stories at r/Andrew__Wells
His eyes glittered with mischief as he eyed me . As if trying to figure me out . He stroked my cheek for a thousand of his precious breaths . As if trying to remind me of the world 's greatest mistake .   `` I think I 've found the wrong one . Do you remember a game she played when you were young ? How you held your daughter ? '' He smiled to himself .   `` The game of soccer ? ''   `` Oh God , those were so easy for her , I bet . ''   `` You 're the best . ''   I felt my heart skip a beat . I had never played soccer before , and I 'd watched her one game so often before . I nodded in agreement .   `` I 'll see you in a year . ''   He nodded .   I walked off into the sunset . I did n't want to lose myself in the game these nights . What I did n't want was to feel the light on my skin and hear the sound of the waves on the beach . I slipped in my bed and fell asleep .   I woke to a knock at my door . I looked up to see the guard standing there in a black hooded cloak .   `` What 's up ? '' He demanded .   `` Look , I know you 're in the room , but I 'm just trying to get the call . You 're needed . '' He walked back to the door and pointed .   `` No shit ! '' I shouted .   `` Shut up ! I 'll call an ambulance . You 'll die already , and probably sooner than I think . '' He barked .   He walked back to the door and put his hand on mine . He pulled me closer and I cried out . I cried until I knew I was losing my mind .   `` Please tell me , please . What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I just want me to be happy , '' he said .   I cried louder .   `` No . I do n't want you to die . ''   He pulled out his gun and leveled it at me . I fell over to my knees and I cried out again .   `` Please , please . Tell me . Please . ''   `` Please . Please ... '' I whispered .   The bullet hit me on the forehead .   A knock at my door . I opened it and there it was .   `` I 'll try to tell you anything , '' he said .   `` Oh god . The game of soccer ? ''
`` What the hell is going on here ? ''   `` Oh god , man I 'm starving , all of this . What kind of fucked up situation is it ? I 'm kind of confused , I do n't understand what to do . I 'm about to get all of this out of my system , and there 's no way I can live on Mars without being eaten by a fucking human ! ''   `` No . We can . ''   She stepped out of the spaceship and into the blue abyss of space . She saw three people walk towards her , one of them holding a gun in his hand . The other two followed suit , and then one of them stepped forward towards her . He pulled the trigger , and stopped short .   She was standing upside down and still . The human that was holding her turned around , and walked away .   The second person stepped forth and started to sob .   `` God , fuck , what the shit ! ''   `` Help . Please , I know it 's going to take someone long , but I need you to help ... ''   `` What ? Am I being saved ? ''   `` No , this is your first mission . You 're the only human humanity needs in the solar system , and you need your help to save lives of her . You need to save her . ''   `` What about all the people who died on my mission ? What about those who just walked through that door and there 's nothing there ? ''   `` Trust me , we ca n't go back . They killed three of my group , in the middle of a battle . Do n't you give that up . ''   She stood up , and looked around . She saw more of the people walking around . There was an old couple , and a younger couple , but all of them were all wearing similar fatigues .   She looked around . No one was around her . She threw her hands up in the air and felt wind on her face as she started to see a few distant stars .   `` I do n't understand , '' she whispered from the darkness .   She looked back , and saw a spaceship that came towards her . She jumped out of it , and ran into the vast expanse of rock that surrounded her . She held her breath , and moved closer towards the spaceship to get closer to it .   `` Please help me ! '' she begged .   The ship turned around , and then started to descend .
`` So , you 're telling me you do n't believe in God ? '' James asked , confused .   `` Well , '' the mysterious alien answered . `` I have no idea . There 's nothing you can do about it . There 's nothing you can do about it . It 's a cruel hoax . ''   `` Do you mean that you believe in God ? Or the whole concept of the supernatural ? '' James asked , still confused .   `` No , no , '' the alien answered , `` I believe in two things : God , and Satan . ''   James stared at the alien . He had never seen the alien before , but there was the unmistakable warmth from its face . It was the one he needed on the day he met God .   `` You 're kidding me ? ! '' James exclaimed , `` It 's so real ! It 's a lie ! It 's pure , and the truth is that humans are so stupid . ''   `` But , I believe God ! ''   `` Then why should I believe in God ? '' James asked , `` Because there 's nothing you can do about it . ''   `` Well , '' the alien answered , `` I have no idea how you are here . You 're just here , in a movie . ''   The alien was visibly irritated . `` There has to be something you can do about this , James . ''   `` Okay . A movie . Let 's just watch . ''   James watched as the aliens watched , still confused . He watched as they watched , and watched as they watched . James watched as the aliens watched , and watched . James watched as he watched . As they watched . James watched as the aliens watched , and watched . And watched . And watched . James watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched .   And watched   And watched .   The alien looked down at James .   They stared at each other , with tears in their eyes .   `` ... James ? '' James asked in a much deeper voice , `` ... do you believe in God ? ''   James tilted his head , his eyes still locked on the alien . `` God ... yes ... ''   The aliens both stared at each other . `` ... you are joking ? ''   James shook his head nonchalantly the whole time . `` No , '' He muttered . `` I do n't believe in God , I believe in God . ''   `` You have no idea . '' The alien replied , quietly , but firmly , `` You 're lying ! You 're imagining things , are n't you ? Think about something bad ! Something terrible , something bad ! ''   `` I ... we 're not going to see it soon enough . '' James admitted , `` We ca n't see it , we 'll never see it . ''   `` I know . ''   `` We 'll be okay , you know . We 'll be alright , we 'll be okay . It 'll be okay , we can be alright , we can be okay , we will be okay . But this is the only time I know . ''   The alien shook his head sadly , `` We ca n't go to jail , James . We ca n't go to jail . We ca n't go to jail . We ca n't go to jail . ''   The alien sighed . `` We ca n't go to jail . We ca n't go to jail . If we do n't , we do n't even have to go to jail . We ca n't go to jail . We ca n't go to jail . We ca n't go to jail . We ca n't go to jail ! We ca n't go to jail ! ''   James shook his head sadly . `` We have to do something .
I watched the world as I looked down at my body . My head was pounding from the shock , but I managed to muster up the courage to go to the emergency room as quickly as possible . The first thing I saw for that long was the face of a giant creature in front of me . I recognized it as my own . It was a demon from one of the stories . I 've heard of them in history . I knew I was destined to be a hero someday . I started sprinting once again . I was nearing the edge of the ocean , I was getting close to the surface . My body was turning white , the waves beginning to turn into ice , and I felt the temperature drop . When I got closer ... I heard ...   `` It 's coming ! ''   I heard blood . My lungs were burning and I could n't breath . I closed my eyes and took a deep breath . I opened my eyes to see a creature , towering over me , standing on top of the ocean , eyes gleaming in the sun .   `` I 'm not surprised , '' I thought , `` I did n't expect the monster to come up here , and it certainly has n't been waiting for me . '' I started to weep .   `` It says here in the Bible that this is your fate , '' the little figure said .   `` What are you talking about ? What do you have in store for me ? '' I asked .   `` The Bible says , `` Father of Man , you will inherit the Earth . ''
I woke up with an ungodly feeling . I still remember the time I woke up in a coffin , covered in various layers of glass . The smell of burned flesh filled my nose as I inhaled slowly . I 'd done this thousands of times before , in fact the last time was when I was in a coma .   I had never died , never had I been in any hospital before , never had my mother was in one of those horrible situations ; it was as though she was about to fall asleep , then the clatter of glass on metal . If I 'm being honest , I could n't imagine what would have happened if she had n't gone into the hospital when I discovered the situation .   I put on a bandage . I was bleeding , but my hand was still attached to the metal and it did n't hurt . I had started picking up my guitar . I was going to use it to record some kind of performance , but if I was going to die , I needed to practice , so I held on tight for a few minutes . I glanced around .   A faint glow filled the air as the coffin began to open . It did n't even look like a coffin .   I cautiously approached the corpse . It 's eyes did n't leave my sight for what seemed like an hour . I saw them from the darkness of the prison . Finally , a tiny light illuminated the coffin , and I grabbed a torch from my pocket . I started to speak , but my throat did n't even move .   `` Hello . '' I said . The voice came out a little lower .   I hesitated . `` Um ... My name is Rick ... and uh , is this Rick ? '' I could n't muster the words to speak more . `` Rick ... who are you ? ''   The figure 's thin lips barely moved . `` I 'm your Grandfather . ''   `` Is that the first thing you remember ? We were walking down Fifth Avenue when everything happened . You were in the middle of a zombie horde playing guitar ! ''   Rick seemed perplexed by this . He began walking down Fifth Avenue . I started chanting . The thought of zombies striking up a peaceful sleep filled my mind . I tried to take a step back , but I was unable to . At first , I thought it was just a hallucination . But quickly , I realized it was true , I was alive .   `` Are you serious ? ! '' I roared , and the figure stopped . I looked over at my Grandfather . He had a massive smile on his face and he wore a suit . His hands were on his head .   He looked at me with a loving eyes . `` I 'm so glad you 're here with me ! You knew this was happening , right ? ''   I stared at my Grandfather for a bit . He started to cry , and his face became flushed with tears . Just then , a zombie crashed through the window blinds .   I looked at my Grandfather . He was still sobbing . I looked down at the ground . I stood up and felt a sense of dread come over me .   `` Rick ... we 're going to get through this . '' I had no choice but to hold onto my Grandfather .   `` We still have the power , right ? ! '' I yelled , and the creature launched a bullet into the wall .   I was nagging at him until I saw that he laid down on the ground . I grabbed the torch and stood up to look at my Grandfather .   `` I 'm sorry , but this is n't the time to apologize ! '' I shouted again and the creature dropped the torch .   `` Who ? When ! ? ! '' I screamed . My Grandfather began to scream .   The creature fell back onto the ground , and I grabbed the torch and held it up to his face . I drew my shovel in front of him and began digging . I did n't bother putting all of the shovels in the hole .   My Grandfather 's face started to turn pale . He started to get more violent . I turned my shovel upside down .   As my shovel turned into a skeleton , my shovel grabbed a handhold . My hand was caught on one of the bones by some zombie I had seen earlier . I rushed over to it and grabbed it with my other hand .   My Grandfather turned around and started running around . I could hear it coming from everywhere . I had to find Rick . I backed away as fast as I could , until I heard a muffled growl and the cry of the undead
I never thought I 'd be so out of luck . I thought it was a beautiful idea , a great idea , I 'd just have to find someone new . I think it may have been over a decade ago , so I ca n't really tell . All I know is , I ca n't really fathom how . I 'm so in love with her . I 'm so smart , that every time she walks into a room , I think it 's her . No matter how many times I 'm with her , she never notices me . No matter how I try to hide or hide , she always finds me . I never left her in that room , never really got to see her again . I remember this day like it was yesterday , she talked to me like it was yesterday . We talked for hours . We talked for days , but she never said a word . She really did n't want to talk to me . She never noticed me . She could n't even hear me . What a marvelous idea . I could never leave her in that room . I ca n't help but think of her . She always has something to say , something that I would never forget . I ca n't believe it though . I think we 're friends who were all in contact with each other . I hope she is happy to be with me . I think that our friendship is so amazing , and that she 'll never love me . I wish she would n't leave me . And I hope that I 'll never miss her .  ___  EDIT : Formatting
`` What the hell are you doing here ? ''   The young man looked up at the old woman . As she looked around the gathering , he could see the same amount of people gathered around him . `` I 'm not helping you . ''   She shook her head . `` I 'm trying to . I think you 're right . ''   The old woman smiled , and looked around at the wizards . `` You 're right . ''   `` But ... '' The young man stammered . `` I 'm just trying to ... ''   `` You 're right ! '' She turned and walked briskly away . The wizards began to scurry around him , but as he went on , they noticed the young man in the corner . He looked as if he was wearing a robe .   Then ... they noticed him . `` I do n't get it . '' The young man suddenly stopped and looked at the wizard . `` I do n't get it . ''   `` Well , it does n't matter how many times you try , just stop doing it , and what more do you want ? ''   `` I need to have a word with you . It sounds more like a prayer . '' The wizard thought for a second , and then quickly nodded . `` And I do n't want you to do it . ''   She then left . Before they could run around the gathering , more wizards , and more children started to flock around him .   `` I need you to be strong . I do n't want you ruining it . '' He said . `` If you do n't have a word , I will fix it . ''   `` I ca n't , '' the wizard said . `` I do n't want you to ruin it . ''   `` You 're right . '' The witch said . `` Then I have to be strong . I will help you . ''   The young man sighed , and pushed the book away from him . He stood up and walked over to another large table . `` Right . So , why do you want me to help you ? ''   `` Because ... '' The elderly woman said , staring at him .   `` Because I wanted to help you ! '' The wizard said , still looking at him .   `` Because ... '' The witch said , looking away from the wizard . `` Because if you do n't have a word , I will fix it . ''   `` Fine , '' the young man said , and stood up . He walked over to another large table . He sat down on it , and stretched his arms . He pointed to the paper . `` This book is an ancient parchment , and it says here that you take the form , or the form . ''   `` What does that mean ? '' The old woman asked .   `` Please.. take the form . ''   The young man began to write . He began to chant .   The old woman smiled . `` Thank you , Harry . I ca n't wait to hear my end . ''   `` Nevermind . ''   `` Good luck ! ''   The wizard walked away .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The old woman sat at the library in the library . She looked at it , looking up at the old woman . Then she smiled at the young man .
They walked in the door and I walked past them without looking at them . I 'm glad it was n't another person I met , and the fact that I was n't an older and that I was n't aware of them made me really feel like I was in a hospital room .   Their car pulled up to an empty parking lot , and I ran in , trying to get to my room . There were people there in the backseat , and they looked pale . I was n't sure why anyone would want to come in here , but I could feel myself getting lighter . I realized they were all wearing masks , but I really did n't know what to expect . They had long dark hair , and my eyes were red . My clothes , which were a bit too long , showed that I had a lot of them , and I was wearing them .   `` Honey , where were we ? '' My daughter Anna called out , breaking the silence until I said nothing more . The mask went on .   `` Danny ? '' She called out .   `` Danny ? '' I shouted back . I knew what to do . I turned to Anna , still trying to stay focused on her . She was still crying pretty loudly , but I knew it was only a moment .   `` I did n't know you were in there , '' she stammered out .   `` Honey ! I think your parents are asleep ! Please , I did n't know you were still home , please ! ''   `` Why did you say this ? Are you upset ? '' Anna 's voice started to become softer , but I was too quiet to hear it .   With a sigh , I got my dressed , and turned to her . She was too pale to see , but she was n't afraid . She could n't look very well , and she was starting to look like she was going to cry . I stepped outside of the car , and it was dark outside . I walked around the car , looking for my parents .   `` Mom , I just wanted to go to the hospital , '' I said softly .   `` I do n't know , I do n't know , '' she said .   `` What can I do for you ? ''   `` Do n't know , '' I told her .   I laid down on my bed , and looked at my parents . I did n't know how long I had been locked up here . I felt like I did n't know anyone . I looked at my body and saw the scars that I had long since gone through , and the bruises that I had missed . I looked at Anna and saw that she was still crying , but she was n't crying at all . She was still crying heavily .   `` We 'll be ok , Mom . We 'll see you in two months . ''   She hugged me tightly . Her cheeks were flushed red , and her eyes looked as if they had the green they used to . I saw a tear roll down her cheek .   `` I love you , Danny , and I promise you . I love you , Anna . '' 
 `` I 've seen this before , '' James replied , looking down at the plate in his hands . `` It 's a very small one , and is practically indistinguishable from any other plate . ''   `` Does it make you feel like this is important ? ''   `` It does , I swear . ''   `` *Well , * why is it important to me ? '' he asked , his voice soft with concern , but with a hint of worry . *Why does n't it go away ? * It seemed like James was asking the same kinds of questions out of everyone in his family .   `` This has to be important , James . You ca n't just leave this with a forklift . ''   `` Oh . '' James said , sitting back up , and walking over to the stove . `` But it 's a forklift this fast . What else could I need ? Is there a way for me to get some food ? ''   `` There is , '' he said , staring at the plate in his hands , `` And it 's not just a forklift . It 's a forklift . What else could I need ? ''   `` It 's just a forklift , you see , '' he said , moving closer to the stove . `` It 's not just a forklift . It 's a forklift . You 're just making it into place , but it 's the same thing over and over . If you go in there and do n't come back out , it 's going to go away . ''   `` So what 's it need ? '' James asked .   `` It 's a forklift . Look at it . It 's a very large one . Look at it . ''   `` Well , *I ca n't just leave it there* . Look at it . ''   James looked at the plate , trying to understand what it was talking about . It was completely white . `` It 's just a forklift . It 's just a forklift that has to be moving to do something , '' he said , picking up a nearby table and taking a seat .   `` *No , * '' James responded , looking back at the plate . `` It 's a forklift . Look at it . It 's a forklift . Just a forklift . ''   `` It 's *not* a forklift . This must be important . You see , this is *a forklift* . It 's not just a forklift . It 's a forklift that has to live , and it 's definitely not a forklift that I 'm going to be eating . ''   `` Look , '' James said , looking at the plate in front of him , `` You 're just making it , just like I 'm showing you . We 're going to be eating , as you know . ''   `` If I eat , it 's going to be a forklift , too . It 's going to be *not* a forklift . Look at it . No , we do n't have to eat this , we just have to be hungry . ''   `` How do I know , James ? ''   `` We can talk about it , if you insist , '' he said , taking off his hat , and putting it on . `` We can talk about this . We can talk about *everything* . ''  
I stare into her eyes and see the fear .   It makes me nauseous . How did I get this ? Just yesterday , I tried to kill myself but I could n't , so I started a long line of knives I had set up for myself . I did n't want to get rid of someone that would end up with knives or a knife I saw in the alley .   She stares at me for a long moment . You know , we both know how this is , and the pain would kill us all .   She has tears streaming down her face , `` I can do this , '' she says .   It feels like a million times before , as I drop the knife .   She is n't scared anymore , and I do n't know why . I guess we have to take care of each other . She 's my everything . I ca n't change it , I ca n't do it at will . I want to get rid of anything .   Then she screams . I ca n't hear , I ca n't die .
The room was dark , but I could see the corner of my eye . The dark brown of the floor . I could hear footsteps approaching . I could feel the cold metal of the pistol pressed against my temple and the blood running down my face . I felt a presence approaching the chair in front of me . It was standing at the end of the hallway . I could n't move or move , could n't move or even see . The door swung open and two muscular men in black suits walked in from the shadows . Their eyes were empty . The thick black glasses sat on the table . The man on the left wore a simple black suit with a white shirt and black tie . He began talking .   `` Hello , are you Jason ? '' he asked .   `` What the hell ? '' I said , `` I 'm not Jason . I am a kidnapper . ''   `` Oh . Well then ... '' the man in the white suit said , `` That would make sense . You 'll have to be more specific . ''   I moved closer to the chair and looked at the man in the white suit . The man sitting across from me was much younger , taller , thinner , stronger , and larger . All of his hair was curled into a neat , neat bun . He was wearing a red tie and a black tie . The man in the white suit made a very confused face and asked a long , slender question . I told him `` what 's your name ? ''   `` Is n't that my wife ? '' I asked .   `` No , that 's not her . She was taken from me when I was six . ''   `` Then ... '' the man in The White suit said , `` You 're going to let her go ? ''   `` No . '' I said , `` It would be easier if I said that . ''   The man in The White suit said , `` So , you wo n't let her go ? ''   `` No . ''   `` So this is n't your wife ? '' I asked , `` Then , that 's not your wife ? ''   The man in The White suit was more confused than I thought possible and said , `` She 's pretty . ''   `` How about we try a different kind of kidnapping ? ''   `` I 'm sure it would help them get rid of me , but it would take too much effort . ''   `` Okay , fine . ''   The man in The White suit said , `` Alright . Let 's get out of here . ''   I walked out and walked down the hallway . The man in The White suit began talking , `` You need to wake up . ''   `` What is that ? '' I asked .   `` It 's a box . ''   `` A box ? ! '' I yelled , `` Oh my God ... this is n't my wife ! ''   `` Hey ! '' the man in The Black suit said , `` We 've got to get out of here . Do n't let her go , we 've got to get out of here ! ''   The man in The Black suit looked at me and said , `` We 've got to get out of here . ''   I started to cry and ran down the hall . The man in The Black suit was n't going to let me go , but the two men next door had n't been to the truck since . I ran out of the building and looked around nervously . There were other people in the building . I could see them . I could hear the footsteps approaching . It was pitch black . There were other people walking by , but they were n't anywhere near me . They did n't seem too concerned about me . They were walking around with empty bags . The truck was n't in the parking lot yet . There was no time to think . I just bolted through an alleyway . I ran past people and got into the truck . It was n't in the truck anywhere . I ran past people again and again . There was no time to think about what I was going to do . I was running from people and getting into the truck . I ran past people and then again . I was getting closer to the truck . I was getting closer . I was getting closer . I was getting closer to the truck . I was getting closer . I was getting closer . I was running .   I was getting closer . I was getting close to the truck . Something was going on . I was going to die . My blood was rushing . I was going to die .  
`` So what is your story , Doctor ? '' the young woman asked as he placed the small glass in front of her .   `` It 's the first time I 've ever told you , '' the man replied to her .   `` Well , I was working from home so I do n't really know what I 'd do if I ever told you . ''   `` Yeah , you could probably say that . ''   `` Please , let me tell you . ''   `` Just tell you anything . How did you get there , Doctor ? ''   `` I 've been in a lot of quite a while . ''   `` You have n't been to all the places you go yet ? ''   `` You know , just ... I dunno . ''   `` Then I guess I can answer the questions after what I 've done . ''   `` I suppose it 's fun getting anywhere but here . ''   `` Why do n't you tell me about everything you have done ? ''   `` I guess it really helps that I do n't have to ask . ''   `` So what would you do if you wanted to ? ''   `` I 'd rather not answer the questions then just tell you . ''   `` Well , you see , yes , I know that this is getting to you , but let me tell you . ''   `` I 'm not really sure how to answer this , but I do know that this is more than what I 've done . So I sit here and enjoy my tea . It 's nice to see you again , Doctor . ''   `` If I do n't answer the questions soon enough , you say they 'll never go away . ''   `` I know , well then maybe you can tell me what you have done . ''   `` That 's a great idea . ''   `` No . ''   `` Oh really ? ''   `` I 'm fine . ''   `` That 's fine , you know . ''   `` No ! ''   `` I 'm fine ! ''   `` Well , I guess I can start by saying you 're not really fine . ''   `` Well , maybe you can ? ''   `` I guess I can . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` What did you do when you went to bed ? ''   `` I got up so I could sleep at night and I felt so tired . ''   `` So you were n't really tired at all ? ''   `` Nope . ''   `` And did you go to bed ? ''   `` No . ''   `` And did you do something that you did n't do when you woke up ? ''   `` Oh , no . ''   `` Then why did you do that ? ''   `` Well , I went to bed . I put my pillow over my face and lay down . ''   `` And did you do anything that you did n't do when you woke up ? ''   `` I guess . ''   `` And why did you do it ? ''   `` I guess . ''   `` So why did you do it ? ''   `` Because I was tired . ''   `` But you were tired . ''   `` I was tired for the last few months . ''   `` But how long did you do it ? ''   `` I could n't sleep . I could n't see . I felt so alone . So hungry . So alone . ''   `` Then why did you do it ? ''   `` Because I wanted to sleep . ''   `` And did you do that ? ''   `` Just because I wanted to do it does n't mean I wanted to do it . ''   `` And how does it define you to me ? ''   `` Because it does . ''   `` And how does that define you to me ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Do you really want to argue ? ''   `` No . ''   `` So , how do you define yourself to me ? '' 
Fucking doin ' what I do   I 'm gon na fuck her ,   And I 'll fuck those ...   Those eyes ...   They 'll be dead soon   But I wo n't die   Just see her eyes .   Eyes full of fear   So long that they 'd be so ...   Pissed all over her body ,   And she cries out in agony .   And she sits there helpless for a while   Because being so dumb sucks   They say I 've done it too .   I 've done what I do   For killing all those people .   But I 'm still sick of being rude ,   I 've done what I do   For killing so many people   And now I have to ask ,   Why did you do it ?   Because when it comes to being shitty ,   And I do n't belong here :   Because I do n't belong in this world   And I need to ask ,   Why did you kill all those people ?   Because because you said 'Hey , I 'm not gon na kill you ! '
`` I ca n't believe you called me that . '' the little redheaded man said , not really caring about the other man . `` No point in not calling you that . You just said you 'd be happy to stay here longer . ''   `` Well ... you seem to believe me . '' the other man said .   `` Why do n't you just go on a walk around the park , pick up your controller , maybe play a game ? I still ca n't believe it ! ''   `` Look , I know you are n't exactly a great game player , but I 've seen you play chess . It was great ! ''   `` And why ? ''   `` I guess you could say you have an exceptional talent in chess , man . ''   They sat in silence for a while . Finally , the other man spoke up , `` Yes , why would n't we have a chess match ? ''   The little redheaded man sat down in a chair and took a few deep breaths . Finally , he spoke , `` I 'd love to watch a game of chess with you . Can you give me that promotion ? ''   The little man in the redheaded jacket laughed . `` Not exactly , mate . '' He took a few deep breaths and said , `` I 'll be back in a few weeks . ''   The little man smiled , happy to have the promotion .
The sky was a beautiful blue , and the birds were singing softly in the distance . I felt the warmth of the sun through my eyelids . Everything was still , and I could see nothing but my surroundings .   Despite being completely submerged , I awoke to the sound of the crashing waves . I lay back , gazing up at the sky that was now covered in golden clouds . When I finally looked up , I saw an oddly familiar shade of blue standing on a row of white islands . If I looked up , I would see a beautiful pair of headlights , of golden tinted windows , and a magnificent beautiful view of the beach below .   I lay there , waiting for the wind to take me back and I would have a proper rest . In that moment , I knew that I was not alone . As the sun sank lower into the sky , I found myself face to face with the Earth , its inhabitants .   I started to feel weak , as if I had gone through a deep sleep . Suddenly , I noticed that my mother was rushing towards me , like I had gone through an earthquake . I quickly rushed out of bed , but she tripped and fell into me .   I turned away . My mother was lying on the ground . Her eyes were closed .   `` You ... you 're.. '' My mother began , but I already knew .   I continued to feel weak , until I found myself in front of an entirely different world . It was a completely different one .   I began to move backwards , as if I was in some sort of box . Everything seemed to be a completely different place , except , for the humans : they were floating above me and towards the beach . I tried to move them upwards , but they seemed to have no idea how to move .   A single tear fell from my eye , but it was stuck in the ground before it hit me . I threw , but caught myself with the force of my fall .   I landed on my face , and the tears started to flow down my face . I looked at my mother and saw that she was crying .   The entire time , I was crying , alone .
The light , blinding , blinding . This was it . I was finally free .   And then it was over .   It was over .   The light once again blinded me , the light I could only imagine in my head , that once I began to comprehend my surroundings , it again blinded me . I would n't be able to see anything , I could n't hear anything , I could n't move or feel anything . I just knew .   `` God ... Jesus ... . ''   I fell . I was in a white room , with no doors . There was only a single door left . One which told me I was here . I could n't see , but I could feel the light that surrounded me , enveloping me , that began to form into a body .   I could n't feel myself . I could not feel myself . I could n't see . My body was gone .   I sat there , floating , and I stared at the body I had left behind , as it had been for a long time . It was dead .   I looked up from the body . I could see the figure , in the blue of his robes , standing next to me , in the shape of a man . He stared at me , tears streaming down his face , and I could feel his regret grow , his anger grow .   `` What 's wrong ? '' I asked .   `` Nothing ... . Nothing ... . ''   `` But ... .why ? ''   I was confused , but kept staring at the figure .   `` Why are you here ? I mean , you killed him . I killed him , *god* . I killed all you humans . You killed him , so that your own creations could have the power to change him . None of that mattered to me . ''   `` But ... .why ? ''   `` Because , not only did you kill them , but you also killed them , and you killed God , so that your creations could live as a single family . ''   `` But why ? ''   `` Because you killed the son of God . God , in your infinite wisdom , had created all humans . ''   `` But ... .why ? ''   `` Because you killed the son of God . ''   `` But ... .why ? ''   `` The son of God , Lucifer , found love . He cried . He held God , and cried . But God was gone . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because God ... ''   `` Why ? WHY ? ''   `` Because God was gone . His children died , his children moved on , his wife never had a single house . But God , Lucifer , held her , and cried . He cried until God was gone . And Lucifer ... .the Son of God , felt joy . Lucifer experienced joy until God was gone . ''   `` Why ... .why ? ''   `` Because God ... .the Son of God , felt sadness . ''   `` But ... .why ? ''   `` Because God was gone ... .and Lucifer felt the joy again . But it was over . ''   `` But ... . ''   `` Because Lucifer , as he knew God , had killed him . ''     
# # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap )   The night they would end up together , the angel would be upon her , and she would be nothing more than the last thing that she saw before her guardian angel moved on . She had expected many things , but she was surprised when they had both vanished a few days ago . She had not expected two months of fear of seeing her guardian angel ever again , but as she looked to the horizon , she could see it . It was impossible not to feel it . In all her years she had not seen a single thing or object that had looked like it before , like it would go down without incident .   The sky shifted slowly , changing color as the sun struck the ground . There was nothing but darkness . She had not felt anything like this before , but she did not think she would . Her guardian angel stood at the foot of her bed , glancing at her like it did every morning for the last two years . The angel that she had never known was now completely unmoving .   `` Well , you look nice , '' the angel said , her voice now distant and calm . `` Did you know ? ''   `` Not really . ''   `` Did you know what a life you were with was ? ''   The angel nodded , and the angel turned to face her again . `` Well , I do n't have much life left . I kind of hate to be honest . ''   The angel 's smile faded , and she looked up at the sky , studying the angel . It was a cloudy evening , and the stars were still high . She knew it was beautiful , but there was something else in that direction she could only describe . The more she looked at it , the more her eyes grew blurry .   `` I 'm glad you can do this , '' the angel said , leaning back in her bed . `` You 've grown beautiful . ''   `` I 'm glad you can . ''   `` I 'm a bit sorry , but the world is n't perfect . You 're not perfect , and I 'm sorry . ''   The angel smiled again . `` I 'm a bit sorry , but I 'm not perfect . It 's all just a dream . ''   `` Do n't worry . I remember when you first woke up . ''   The angel nodded . `` I remember being afraid of what would happen if I saw what would happen . It would feel like I had to look at you . You 're safe . '' She shook her head . `` But now , the world is really just a dream . There is nothing you could do to change it . ''   The angel smiled . `` No , I do n't want to . It 's just a dream . I am . I am . ''   The angel looked down at the ground again , still glowing . `` I understand why you can not have a guardian angel . I ca n't have it anyway . I can be there with you . ''   She walked to her bed and turned on the light . The room was empty , save for the angel that lay at the foot of her bed . `` Is that good , ? That 's what you did . It 's not what you asked for . ''   The angel nodded . `` Take care of him . Be safe . ''   The angel walked slowly back into her bed , laying in it for the last time . She opened her eyes , and was greeted by the angel that she had not seen before . Her angel was holding the hand of hers , and she felt the cold metal slide down to her back .   She felt the warm blood drip down her back , and her head hurt . She felt the cold metal slide down to her chest , and she was n't sure what happened next .
The first couple times it happened I was just standing inside my apartment , thinking about my life and how I wish there was something more out there . I thought about all the times I had been beaten to death and I was just scared . I thought about everything the people there were to hurt me with . I had a good time at school . I got an assignment in biology . I got a call from my mother crying from her `` you 're a big man . You 're going to be a great teacher . '' She yelled at me from downstairs , just as I was getting ready to jump to the other side of the office . I got home , quietly sobbing . By the time I was ready , I was feeling better . I had a good time here , at school . I got to school in order to be a good teacher . The first time there was some people having a fight with my mom , I was scared , but they fought through it . Eventually , I got over the issue and I got over it . It was n't long after that I realized the power I was trying to get . It was all about reading people 's mind . I thought of the people who were in pain , and I imagined the only way to feel a better person . I thought of the people who were hurting myself . I thought of the places I was going to get to .
“ You ’ re the newbie , Joseph , ” Matt said , his voice echoing through the empty house , “ and that ’ s how big. ”   Joseph paused on the dusty floor below him . His robes were immaculate , and he wore a simple blue robe that was still hanging loosely in the air . Through the dust and sand , Matt could tell that this was his last run of the mill , and none of his friends had ever been invited to the wedding .   “ What does it say , Matt ? ” An older man in a black robe asked , addressing him at the door . He was dressed in a ratty navy robe , and his eyes were a deep , black that he had seen a thousand times before .   “ It said things about you . So , what do we do now ? ” Matt asked , looking around in confusion at the empty house . He had never been accepted here , and this was his first run .   “ Now , I ’ m here to help you find your father . I want you to find a place to stay here , and in exchange for a place to stay , I need someone you can make sure they keep your secrets away from the public. ”   “ But… but , Joseph , ” Matt said , raising one finger . This man was obviously uncomfortable with what he was asking Matt . He could feel the fire inside of him growing in his face .   “ No , dad . It ’ s not for the same reasons . The fire-for-goers are not here to hear your confession , or hear your name in the bible , what have you done ? ”   “ I… I… ” Matt stammered , looking around in wonder at the empty house .   “ Joseph , you have to listen to me . It was not an accident . It wasn ’ t a small accident . I ’ m sorry. ”   “ You are being protected from what they will ask , ” he said . “ The Church has given you a choice . If you have anything to say , this is it . We can give you a choice , but no one else can . There are better ways to pass the test. ”   “ Only on the Church ’ s terms . As long as I am worthy of it . Of this church . And that is what I am willing to do. ”   “ Will you let them learn ? ” The old man asked , looking to the floor below him .   “ I don ’ t know , son . I ’ m afraid I can not let everyone . So , you are ready to be chosen , and you should not let anyone do anything to stop you here ... ”  
I sat on the bench watching the sun set as the sun set to the horizon and the warm embrace of water washed over my body . I was not sure why I stood there , but the feeling of the grass around me was comforting . My breath came in quickly , though only when I felt fresh air and something warm .   I tried desperately to sit , but I could not . My knees ached from all the exertion I had managed to put on . I pulled myself up , and there was a place to rest . I tried to remember how I got here , where I was from , what happened , but my eyes opened .   It was the park , the old man stopped halfway down the path . The light from the sun 's rays pierced through the canopy of trees , and illuminated his face , no doubt knowing what he was looking at . I could not move , my eyes could n't move long , and I could not move while feeling around . I could not say a word when my vision fogged , but I tried to remember how I got there . I tried to remember what we were there for .   I was standing in the park , when another sound startled me . It was a gentle breeze , and I ran towards it . The young man fell asleep next to me , and woke up . I waited until he was asleep for a moment , but the sound continued . I slowly gathered my thoughts , and began to put my head against my chest . I glanced up at the sky , wondering if I wanted to sleep with him , but I could not . I did not want him to be awake . I was afraid .   I began to walk slowly towards him , trying to see , but I could not . It took me a moment to realize I was walking alone . I reached the park entrance , and a single figure walked up to me , and spoke to me .   *Have you a moment to think , brother*   I looked up at the man , remembering what I had said , and what had happened . I was startled . Suddenly , I was completely unsure of what to do . I started to walk towards the man who spoke to me , and at the very slightest movement , I was lost .   I sat on the bench , not sure how I got here , because the sun , the sun , the sun was not there . I reached the bench , and a single figure walked up to me , and spoke to me .   *Are you there for me ? Do you love me ? Have you ever really loved someone else ? *   I stared at the man , thinking of what I had said , and if I was ever loved .   *To be honest , I do not really know what I mean by that . I have just thought of you all night , and I have thought of you all day . You were such a great person , brother . You had such a great family . *   I stared at the man , and said , *A great ... family . *
*No ! Please ! *   I grab her hand and throw her in the passenger seat .   `` Listen , I know your name . I 've never met you before . It 's nice . I 'd be happy to help you get back into this mess . But I have n't met you for three years . You 're too late . ''   *Stop acting like one of those bratty morons ! *   `` I work for an insurance company . ''   *Fucking creepy morons ! *   `` Actually , I work for an insurance company . ''   *I like you ! You 're so cute ! What the fuck does that even mean ? *   `` I 'm not saying that I do n't like you ! I 'm saying that you 've never met me before . You might have messed something up . ''   *Look , its just like that . I want you to get away ! I want you to go back . Please ! Please ! *   `` I 'm sorry . I really am . I just want you to stay calm . Let me explain . I recently got laid off and was in a bad part of town . I work at a restaurant where everything is fine . I do n't have very many customers . I just happen to be here the entire time . I was brought in by my co-workers and a fellow employee . We were going out to get milk . I do n't usually get anything . It 's kind of hard to get a raise . We are n't usually allowed to afford anything that is n't provided by us , so we had to do that alone . ''   *Ohhh crap , you 're kidding me . Come on . Get back to work . *   `` I was brought in by my co-workers and the co-workers and a fellow employee . We were gon na go out to get milk . I did n't have anything . It 's kind of hard to get a raise in this town . ''   *It 's not fair . There 's nothing nice about this town . *   `` I did n't get any milk . I found some of it in my lunchroom and put it in the fridge . What kind of milk is that ? ''   *Look , you do n't get it . There 's nothing nice about this town . There 's nothing wonderful about this town . *   `` What kind of milk is that ? ''   `` Nothing unique . I just found a bowl of cereal . It 's kind of hard to get it out of my lunchroom . It 's kind of hard to get it out of my lunchroom . It 's sort of hard to get it out of the lunchroom . I found a bowl of cereal in my lunchroom and put it in my lunchroom . What kind of cereal is that ? ''   *Yeah , I like you . I just want you to stay calm . I really am . *   `` I do n't know what a cereal sounded like . If you did n't like it , I could just come over to you and ask if you had any beef . ''   *What ? Are you serious ? *   `` I 'm serious . I said I did n't like beef . I said I 'm serious . ''   *Good , so you made me change my mind ? *   `` Um , yeah . I do n't think so . I just just wanted to know if nothing else was working out . I had to make sure that everything was working out . I did n't want to be there for anything , but I guess I do . ''   *Okay . I get it . You have your own cereal . It 's kind of hard to get it out of the lunchroom . It 's kind of hard to get it out of the lunchroom . It 's sort of hard to get it out of the lunchroom . I do n't have anything . You do n't even get the milk out of the lunchroom . You do n't even get the milk out of the lunchroom . You do n't even get the milk out of the lunchroom ! *   *Okay . I get it . I get it . I get it . I get it . I get it . I get it . I get it . I get it . I get it . *   `` Okay . I got it . I get it . ''   *Wait . What ? Why did you say
`` Wait , there 's nothing on the other side of heaven , right ? And why am I here ? '' Jeremy stammered . `` Why did I come here ? What the hell is this place ? ''   His wife , Melinda , had just been promoted to assistant manager at the local Catholic Church , and was about to leave for work when she saw Jeremy moving to the other side of the city . She rushed in and hugged his shoulder .   `` Jeremy , I just- ''   `` Look at me . ''   Melinda looked down at Jeremy 's beautiful face . `` Come on , Jeremy . I 've been waiting for you for a long time . ''   Jeremy did n't answer . He walked carefully forward and picked up the phone , taking hold of the number in his fingers .   `` ... 2-1 ? ''   Jeremy tried to speak , but only heard the sound of a female voice . `` Mornin ' ? ''   `` Jeremy ! '' Melinda called out . Jeremy continued to run .   `` Melinda ! Jeremy ? ''   `` Yes ? ''   `` Jeremy ! Jeremy ! Jeremy . ''   Tears started running down Andy 's face . `` ... what ? ''   `` I just wanted to say goodbye to you and see your family again . '' Andy said , tears falling from his eyes .   `` Why ? Why would n't you ever come back ? ''   `` We 've been waiting so long for you . ''   Jeremy 's words came out slowly . Not quite in his head , but rather in a faint whisper to Melinda . `` Why am I out here ? ''   `` Jeremy . '' Melinda said , looking down at Jeremy 's beautiful face . `` Jeremy : I 'm sorry . ''   With a small smile , Jeremy walked over to the window . He pulled out his phone and began to dial 911 . He hesitated , but in a quick movement , he saw the number on the other side of the glass . It read 1-1-1 .   As Jeremy tried to open the window , he heard a metallic voice answer . `` Hello ? ''   `` Hello ? Jeremy : Hey , Melinda . You 're here . ''   Jeremy 's eyes widened . `` OH , '' he said , tears streaming down his cheek . `` It 's ok , I 'm here . ''   At that moment , the metallic voice responded . `` Would you like to come to the Hospital ? ''   `` Um ... Oh , yes ? '' Jeremy said . `` Thank you . ''   `` Jeremy . Jeremy . ''   Jeremy opened the door . He grabbed his suitcase and walked to his car . He dropped down in the passenger seat and drove home . He turned off his radio and watched the news .   `` Jeremy ! '' Melinda called out . Jeremy continued to play the radio . `` Stop caring about me . ''   Jeremy continued to drive home , ignoring the calls that seemed flooding his phone . He continued to drive towards his house . Eventually , he had reached his destination , and he continued to scream that he did n't deserve it .   `` Where 's my family ? '' Jeremy asked .   `` He 'd say that , '' Melinda explained .   `` Why would he be there ? '' Jeremy asked .   `` It 's because I ca n't live with him anymore . He 's a liar . ''   `` But how can I live with who I am ? Why ca n't he leave ? Why ca n't he leave ? I 've been waiting so long for him ! ''   `` Jeremy , '' Melinda said as she gently laid the phone back down . `` We both know it 's too late for you . You 've been waiting for him for too long . I just want to say- ''   `` No ! '' Jeremy shouted and spun around frantically . Melissa grabbed the phone tightly tightly and held it loosely between his breasts . She held her breath as he began to scream again . `` Please stop . Please stop ! ''   `` We 're both dead . ''   `` We 're both dead too . ''   Jeremy collapsed onto the couch by the front door . He screamed , blood streaming down his cheek , and ran away from her .
My family was divided when the death of my father occurred . Their funeral had just begun , my mother , my father , my sisters , everyone who 'd ever lived was here . I had a lot of questions to ask , but any answers were wasted on questions I knew I would never understand . I was terrified that someone would come to me with the same fate as my father for every question I asked . When it all started , I was n't sure what I wanted to do anymore . What I wanted to do was make money .   My mother , who I would never see again was still young and beautiful . She was always trying good as I was . She would take care of me , and I would always make sure I was n't going insane . She took care of me . As the years passed , I started to hear more of them . I grew more concerned about the questions I 'd have to ask , but I never found a way to make it through .   The few who still lived were so selfish , they decided that I had to keep living in peace . As I was still alive , but was almost gone , it was almost too late . I remember a time when I could talk to people without being able to speak , but it was n't long before I became paralyzed in fear of them . Everything was so slow . I knew I would die , I knew I would die soon , but I never wanted to hear the truth anymore .   I was trapped in nothingness in my brain . I was n't sure what to do anymore , and I was scared at first , but eventually it became part of me . I tried and tried to communicate , but I could n't . I tried to speak to everyone , but I was n't going anywhere . I was going to die , but at what cost ?   Everyone died that day , but I kept living . As I grew older , I had to take care of my sister and go to school . I did n't want to die , but I was n't going anywhere . I knew I was leaving my life behind , but I did n't want to die anymore . I could n't take care of anyone anymore . It was like I had nothing left .   I never heard of my own sister again , so I had to call in sick . I kept calling in sick . I kept dying and dying . I kept dying . I kept dying until something came up .   It was a child . He was sick . He was dead . I could n't stop him . I could n't kill him ...
`` I just wanted to say thanks ! ''   The words left me speechless . For the first time in years , I was n't sure if I had seen my friend leave .   I should have known .   Two years ago , he did n't have much to say . He has n't aged , but I still remember the look on his face when he was gone . I wish I could have known what he said about me .   I wish I could have told him that his wife 's heart will always be in my chest .   My future is in hell .   I know better than to let anyone else know .   What I do n't know , is that he 's just a stranger to me , that I may have found someone else in order to be with him .   I 'm walking .   I 'm alone .   I have n't eaten in weeks .   I 'm alone .   But it 's too late for that now .   The sidewalk is cold .   The fire is on .   I have n't cried in days .   I do n't know if it will be long enough to let him know that I 'm there for him .   If it will be long enough , I can think of one last time .   `` I just wanted to say thank you ! ''
He sat silent , but I could not hear him over the shuffling of papers and murmuring behind me . Not for the first time in my life . I was a mess . That 's all . All because of this goddamn thing . The one I 'm trapped in . How dare someone else be so rude ?   The judge looked him over , then back at me . He looked like a person with a frown . At the same time , almost like a child . It made me think of all the people I would have to kill . All the days I 'd been alive , all the *loud* moments . Of course , no one ever really cared . In any case , they had their reasons to do it . They wanted the job done . They were sick . They were on drugs . So they did n't go back .   The lawyer looked at me , and sighed .   `` You ca n't do this to yourself . I 'm not gon na let this happen to anyone else . '' He said with a shrug .   *Please* , I thought . *How dare they ? *   `` I may have chosen you for war crimes , but I 'm not going to let you win the war . '' I said with tears in my eyes .   The judge looked at me , then back at the shuffling of papers . He looked as if he had thought about something long enough . Then he looked back at me .   `` You can do this to yourself . ''   I looked at myself in confusion . I still had n't done anything that wrong . But I had n't broken anything wrong , and now ... now I was lying in bed with a man in front of me and a murderer behind me in front of me .   I sat up . I looked at the ceiling . I looked at the sun . I stared at the ceiling . I looked at my hands . I stared at my feet . *What is happening to me ? * I thought .   `` You , '' the voice came from behind me , `` you had the right to kill me . '' 
`` Well , that 's another one , is n't it ? ''   I had been thinking about it and this was clearly the most bizarre thing I 'd ever heard of in my life . I could n't help myself from fidgeting so much as to take a deep breath .   `` Yeah , it 's new in this city , '' I said with a kind of smile . I guess I was right .   `` Well . That 's just what I 've just been thinking about for the past few days , '' he continued , looking at the floor , `` I 've lived here a lot of my life and still try to paint , give them kids , and scare them . I love painting , but it 's not that easy , to paint . It 's ... ''   `` I know . We all love painting , huh ? I do . I do n't *really* want to paint anything else . ''   `` Sure you do , '' he looked around , then back at me . `` But you *do* see ! ''   I took a breath and leaned forward , looking at my paintings . `` Uh , '' I began . `` How about we do paint each other ? ''   He looked at me , and then laughed , a small clink of metal on metal . `` Oh , that sounds fun ! '' he nodded , grabbing the paintbrush and starting painting again . He put the brush away and did a little dance , and suddenly this time with a really loud sound all around us , it came from the source of this sound .   `` That 's right , '' he said , reaching across the painting and drawing a small pink light . He put the brush away , and just as quickly as he had drawn the light , a huge chunk of wood started flying out of the roof and into the air . I let out a gasp .   When I looked up , it was gone , replaced by nothing . I could n't find the building but the street , and for some reason , I could n't hear anything except the sounds of the giant tree on the roof .   I sat there in shock and disbelief as the world seemed to spin for what seemed like an eternity . I started to think , '' I really wonder how much this does to me . Why do I have to come here all the time ? '' Finally , I remembered all that I had been thinking about , and I stepped back .   `` I ... I should n't think about it . '' I said . `` It 's just that it 's really not my place . It 's all the same . Why it would work if I *did* want to paint all the time ? ''   He looked at me , and smiled once more , then continued , `` Well , it does n't work . I need to concentrate . ''
I 've seen all the things I need to know about life . The way it always does . I ca n't just stop and get a proper burial , because if it happens when I die I will be back in the same time . That 's right , I know everything about life . But then , there are things I have to not know about humanity .   Living in a new city , I was introduced to four different types of people , some I chose to live off the grid , some I chose to live in luxury . I was raised in a wealthy family , and my wife and I lived a modest and homely life , living in the city and the city .   I 'm a smart kid .   I 've known for a pretty long time that my life was boring , my parents had a child , and my younger brother was born into a wealthy family . I do n't know how many lifetimes had passed , but in the years that I was raised , I 've learned about how my father had been a successful businessman , and his success had just cemented my future in the world .   Of course , that was quickly changed when my parents got sick , and I was forced to give up my job as an electrician . At least that 's what was assumed , until they caught me . That 's when I got the call .   I was in the hospital , strapped in a wheelchair . I could n't see anything , and I could n't hear anything , but I could tell I was dying . My wife started to cry , and my brother 's eyes widened .   `` My child , what 's your name ? '' His voice was unfamiliar , but commanding .   `` My name , James . I 'm sorry , but that was my choice . '' I said , not wanting to make any rash decisions , but I had to accept it . `` Thank you for doing this . ''   I sobbed more than once , and then , suddenly , I was back in control of my life . *I am immortal . * That was the day I became known as the `` James '' .   When I died , I was a young baby . You see , on my deathday , I was born into a rich family , and my wife and I had a two-year-old child . My wife was married to a beautiful woman who loved her job more than anything else , and my mother had two beautiful children . My brother was a successful businessman , and my wife , a beautiful woman , was a successful businessman .   I still remember the first time I died , and how I was being treated . When I died , I was in a wheelchair . I could n't hear anything , but I could say I was dying .   I had to accept it , because I could n't see anything else .
For those who wish to see me  For those that wish to love you ,  For those that wish to hold on to your life  For those that wish to live in harmony  In harmony as your love for you becomes mine 
“ So what ’ s our favourite colour , ” she said , reaching into her pocket .   He pushed his hand through the small bag of groceries and pulled out a handful of chocolate . “ White , ” he said , taking out a small chocolate wrapper . He held it up to the light . It shone a bright yellow-blue , and then yellow , and then a green-white , and then a red-red-green . “ I ’ re not even sure.. ”   “ You don ’ t have to wait , ” she said , handing him a small bag of apples .   “ Yeah… and you know I don ’ t like the colour of apples… ”   “ You have to take a step outside , ” she said .   “ Well… where ’ s the main street ? ”   “ Where in the world is the main street ? I asked. ”   “ Can you just take a step inside ? ”   “ Uh , I mean , can you just open up the bag of groceries ? ”   “ Not your turn , ” she said . “ No way , not really. ”   She was getting impatient , and he had a plan . They had to go in the morning , and she watched him head off to school . It didn ’ t work that way . She watched him disappear at the bus stop , and then disappear in the bus . She watched the bus come and go , and then run out of town . Then she watched the TV stop go downhill , and then out of town . Then she watched the train stop go down . Then out of town . Then out of town . Then down . Then over again , over again . She watched the bus drive down , and then over again . Sometimes , she would watch them come under the car , and then disappear in front of the train , and then come up behind the car , and then disappear again , and then reappear . She watched them climb onto the train and go back up , and then reappear again , and then reappear again , and then reappear again , right after , after , and again . If she watched them climb on the train , she could have seen them ride into town , and then reappear again , and then reappear again… And then reappear again , and then reappear again , and again , and again . Then reappear again , and again , and again , and again . She watched them fly around on the train , and then reappear again before crashing into the floor . She watched them land gently on the street , and then fall to the ground , and then reappear again , and then reappear again , and again , and again…   “ I ’ m not sure… ”   “ I think it ’ s time… ” she said , handing him another small bag of chocolate .   “ Yes… ”
The funeral procession had been packed to the brim with a crowd that had been waiting for what seemed like eternity . I put my hand on my brother 's shoulder and leaned in .   `` I know things are really stressful these days , but my best friend has been in everything I could have wanted . He ca n't hide his emotion anymore , but he can push the limits of what we can do without having to risk it . It made me feel good about it . Whenever we talked , he would start to understand how much I care about him and how much we love him . ''   There was a long silence . I leaned back down and let the tears trickle down my cheeks .   `` We broke up 4 years ago . He was always so angry about how his parents were upset . And then it started happening . We did everything he could to fix it . We did everything together . He would always get that angry look on his face when we talked . ''   I wiped my eyes .   `` I think he has had enough . He has gotten to the point where he feels like the worst that ever happened to him .   `` But , we could have done something more with him , '' I muttered , looking back down at my hands with tears in my eye .   `` I do n't know what he wants to do now , '' my brother said , his voice cracking .   `` He wants to be strong , but he ca n't let it go . ''   `` Yeah , right . ''   -- -   I looked at my brother 's funeral : a big ol ' party on the way out . The flowers were cut down and the casket was closed . I was n't sure what else I could do , but I had to find him anyway . Mom would n't be there to see our little brother mourn . They had left for college and I was making a buck off of it . And the man who said sorry for my mother was probably only 20 or so years old .   `` I do n't know how I 'm going to do it anymore . I have to take him out there so we can be on our own without them . I 'll have to do what I can to make him happy , '' I said , trying to sound patient and steady .   I checked my phone to see if anyone was there .   `` Hey babe , '' my brother said .   `` Hey dad ! '' I jumped at the sound of his voice .   `` Hey dad ! '' I shouted back , and turned around to see my little brother .   `` Yeah , yeah ! '' He said , pointing at me and laughing .   I looked at my phone : a few notifications from him .   `` Hey dad ! ''   `` Mom 's gone ! ''   -- -   I was standing in front of a crowded bouquet of casket after a long wait . It was my mother , staring out the windows , her eyes wide .   `` Your mom ! Dad ! ''   `` Did he cry ? '' She asked .   `` No , I 'm fine ! '' I said . `` I 'm so happy to have you here . ''   `` So happy to have you here . ''   She got up and ran to me . My heart sank as I brought her on .   `` Did he cry too ? ''   `` Yea , just about , but I never really felt anything . ''   `` Okay , alright , honey . ''   I turned away and walked back to the procession . I could feel tears welling up in my eyes and I remembered that I wanted to wait right here and let my brother go .  
“ Hey man , ” Adam said , waving his hand at Peter , “ Do you think I ’ m right ? ”   “ I was just throwing money to start this fire , Adam , ” Peter replied , his voice cracking . He was staring at Adam intently , trying to think of when he would wake up . The flames had grown thick since the last time he had eaten . “ God knows I don ’ t need help , ” he said , “ I know I ’ m just praying. ”   “ I ’ m sure I ’ m right , Christ , ” Adam said , his breath caught in his throat . “ Now , I ’ m going to start with the fact that you are going to need to get some help . You ’ ll know what I mean . It ’ s your fault. ”   The fire pit was silent in the man ’ s mind . Adam looked around at other travelers . Everyone was clustered around a small fire , trying to calm the people . One of the travelers had a bag over his head . He had put it under his arm when he saw the light . He waved to Adam as he took out a gun and a piece of paper .   “ Don ’ t shoot , ” Adam said , “ I ’ m telling you that I am not exactly a man , you have to stop me ! ”   “ What ? ” Peter said , “ Don ’ t shoot ! ”   Adam looked out the fire pan . In the distance , two figures sat on the bench . The first man had a gun pointed at the man , who now held it outstretched in the air . The second man ’ s face was blurred in the same shape as the man , almost as if he was trying to figure out what had happened . Adam and Peter stood there , staring at each other . Another man walked up to the first man and dropped his gun to the ground . He stood up and began to shake .   “ Listen man , you can ’ t shoot anyone . I ’ m a Christian kid. ”   “ Yeah , I ’ m not a Christian kid . But I ’ m going to try something else . I ’ m going to try to help you out and then help you find someone who can help you , ” Adam said , walking over to the second man ’ s leg .   “ Who is this guy ? ” The man said .   “ He ’ s a Christian guy . You ’ ll know when you ’ re done and when you ’ re done . Don ’ t shoot. ”   “ Who are you ? ” Peter said , confused .   “ I ’ m Adam . You ’ ll know when you ’ re done and when you ’ re done. ” The man threw his head back in the air . The two men remained silent for a moment .   The man walked over to the back of the table and grabbed a handful of money from the man ’ s pocket . He started to walk towards the back of the table .   “ Look , kid . I don ’ t know who you ’ re talking about , but I don ’ t think you ’ re a Christian kid . Are you trying to help me find someone who can help you out ? ”   “ I ’ m not a Christian kid , ” the man said , pointing at the small fire pit that had just started .   “ I ’ m not going to help you out , ” Adam said , “ I ’ m a Christian kid. ”   “ Look , Adam , ” the man said , pointing to the small fire pit , “ No , I ’ m not trying to help you out . I ’ m trying to help you out. ”   Adam turned around and began to walk away . The two men looked down at the little fire pit , then back at the two people sitting in front of it . The third man grabbed a handful of bills and threw them into the fire pit . Adam kept walking towards the third man .   “ Are you kidding me ? You don ’ t trust me , ” Adam said , pointing at one of the two people , “ You trust me about you ? You trust me about everything you ’ ve done ? You trust me about all I ’ ve done to you ? ”  
The young boy 's mother was seated across from him in the middle of the table . Her eyes were staring hard at the screen . They were silent , not focused on what she was saying .   `` And ... and you 've told me something about this ? ''   `` Well , you 've told *me* something about this . Not as much as you 've ever said , but some kind of , er ... ''   `` Shh . Did n't you pick up on that ? ''   `` That is why we 're here , you see , just after sunset , and you 've told me what 's on the screen . And I 'm not sure if you 're really supposed to read this already :   *'The End . ' *   *'The End '*   *'The End '*   If you took a moment to consider the fact that this was literally a preppy , self-styled script , let it go . It would do nothing to change the fact that she came from a poor family .   `` Ohh , I have a beautiful , handsome , handsome face , dear , dear , please do n't call me that . ''   `` That 's right , sweetheart . I 'm not sure what you 're really expecting . ''   `` Ohh ! Okay ? I 'll give you another opportunity . ''   `` I hope it 's not something more dramatic . ''   `` Ohh , that 's what I 'm expecting . ''   `` I think it 's just the end now . The end of this is n't the end of any story , it 's the end of the universe . You see , '' the girl 's mother looked up from her screen , `` there 's nothing more exciting than running around in circles , eating bugs , and looking for your love . ''   There was an audible sigh . The boy sat slowly , his mother carefully making sure the girl was standing directly in front of him .   `` Oh , dear , thank God , '' the mother said , `` I 'm not entirely sure if I can do that . ''   `` Oh , dear , dear ! '' the boy said , raising his eyebrows to the side .   `` How do you know that ? ''   `` Well , it 's the end of the universe , the end of the universe , and the end of the universe as well , '' the mother said , `` from all over the universe , '' her fingertips resting on the edge of the table , `` because it 's your idea of the end . ''   `` Well , it 's not exactly my idea , dear , '' the boy replied , pulling his face closer to the screen , `` but it 's the beginning of a story . ''   The mother looked up towards the boy , who 's face was beginning to turn red , then her eyes squinted at him .   `` I see , dear . ''   `` Just tell me a little bit more , dear . ''   `` You see , '' the boy said , nodding , `` You see , the universe *is* ending . My life is ending and the universe is ending . I 'm all alone but I have my own life going on . I can do whatever I want , or I can just live it all out on the street . ''   `` Okay , dear , '' the mother said , looking up again , `` then ... ''   `` Okay . ''   The father 's cheeks grew flushed .   `` Okay , right now , '' the mother said , leaning back , her eyes focused on the screen , `` you see , what you 're supposed to tell me is that the end of the universe is n't the end of any story , but rather a story of some sort . ''   `` Oh , dear , '' the boy said , `` do n't patronize me with that . ''   `` I think it 's my idea , dear . ''   `` Hmmm ... ''   `` Now that you think about it , I 'm sure you have your own life going on and on , but that wo n't do you anything . You just have to try and live it out on the street and live it all out on the street . ''   `` Honey , '' the boy said , shifting uncomfortably in his chair , `` take a sip of your wine . ''  
I look in the mirror again to see myself in another 's . They say they can not see future happiness ; they ca n't see past the truth , only what is truly right . I am a free spirit , they say , simply doing as they will . I can see through the mirror , see them all , I know they do . They say , `` Do n't worry ! '' and they say , `` You will see right through , I know a good and terrible truth . '' I do not . They have everything . We are as happy as we are . No matter what happens I will see the future .   I am lucky if I do n� t see the right thing in the mirror . 
A life of hard work , being a hitman is what makes you one of the biggest killers around .   The last professional hitman in his entire life was Eddie E , a notorious actor in his small town , where he 's seen many countless acts in his day , and even seen the occasional film where he was shot by a shot-by-guner .   He was killed as a child , just as I was killed . He 's seen many things in his life , and he likes to watch everything on his favorite television show . He watches a lot of these shows , but never in his entire life has he received a reason to kill anybody without a conscience .   He knows he needs to do it , but he ca n't risk it , and he knew he did n't need to , either . He knew the way around it . He loves his life , and he 's determined to do it .   With my death in my hands , he gets the call to inform his employers of his decision . He 's made a deal with the best of us , and with his wife 's death , they were ready to take it .   I had to do it . The best , since I was a young man , had to die . I took my first shot at the set , and killed the director .   He still has n't figured out how to kill me , but he was ready to do it .   I took his wife 's hand and held it with my other . She used to hold her hand close to my face , when I was a child . When my wife died , she never knew when to take it . There was only one way to make the most humane decision in my life .   I slowly lifted my sword out of its sheath , and shot it .   He did n't die , and he did n't deserve it . For my entire life , I have been killing people .   I needed to make my decision .   I wanted my best hitman to die .   The director was the best , and only I was the best . He died with his wife 's hand closed around my face , and I took my first shot at the set .   I took my first shot at the set .
“ Do you know what happened at the end ? ”   “ I don ’ t know , it just started… ” Jared whispered . He was trembling and had put his arms behind his head to try and coax the words out . His voice was hoarse and weak , as if he was drowning in his own thoughts .   “ It was about a month ago. ”   Jared ’ s breathing became shaky and his throat hung dry . He looked down at his hands . They didn ’ t look pale ; his skin was smooth and his hands were long and bloody . He looked up and glanced down at his watch again . It was five o ’ clock and the sun was beginning to dip below the horizon . He shook his head , hoping that the sun would break down and continue its lazy dance , but he could not . He had to hurry .   “ Can you just tell me what happened ? ” A voice called from behind him . Jared turned to see a younger man with a small , blond smile . Jared turned around at the voice and saw a boy with a boy ’ s tan face .   “ What happened ? ” Jared asked .   “ We were running . The Sun was going to shine a little brighter. ” He was shocked . “ So long ago they had chased us away from the city . But now… now they ’ re chasing us. ”   Jared shook his heads and wiped the tears from his eyes . He was relieved to see the boy and the boy again .   “ Is it really that bad ? ” He asked .   “ The sun was about to shine a little brighter. ”   “ Are you sure he still remembers ? ”   “ He is. ”   Jared looked back up at the sun and admired its beauty . All around him , the sky was filled with a blue glow . Jared smiled and waited .   “ How long did they chase us ? ” The boy asked .   “ A few hours , ” Jared said .   “ So long ago they were chasing us away ? ”   “ As long as we ’ re safe , ” Jared said .   “ So long ago they weren ’ t chasing us. ”   “ Maybe , but everyone is chasing us. ”   “ I ’ m glad you are , ” Jared said .   “ We ’ re safe , ” the boy said .   “ We are ? ”   “ Yes . I know. ”   “ Are you sure ? ”   “ We definitely are . Let ’ s get them back together . Make sure they ’ re running. ”   Jared put his hands on his head and looked up at the moon . It peaked below the horizon . He looked at the boy and the boy again .   “ Are you sure ? ” The boy asked .   “ We ’ re not in the city anymore. ”   “ And where are they going ? ”   “ Not yet . We ’ re somewhere far beyond the city. ”   Jared shook his head and looked back down at his watch then back up at the night .   “ What is this place ? ”   “ A city of a small city , ” the other boy said . “ We are in the city now. ”   “ But… ”   “ This city should be the last. ”   The boy looked around . He had a quiet , lifeless , almost lonely voice . He hoped that the city would turn to ash and fall to the ground .
As I was about to ask another question about my life , I stopped dead in embarrassment . I had been given this little gift as a welcome gift , and it was truly quite incredible to see a child that aged so far . I watched from afar as he walked up to me . He smiled kindly at me and shook my hand fiercely .   `` Hello , children , '' he said in a reassuring voice . `` I hope you are curious about where you are . ''   I looked at him , awestruck . Why did he just say that ? I looked around the room . I saw people in suits , waiting outside , people sitting across from each other . The man in the suit looked exactly the same as me . His posture was very smooth , but he was wearing a black suit and a grey tie . I could n't quite make out what he was doing .   `` What do you mean you are curious ? '' I asked , finally finding that voice once more .   `` I can explain , child , '' the man said proudly . `` The end of a loved one . ''   No one seemed to notice , or even react . I watched with fascination as he explained and I became very curious about his story . After all , he has lived a long life . I could n't figure out why he did that until one day , when he had been brought to the afterlife for his last speech . His eyes were fixated on my eyes , a hint of sadness creeping in .   `` I was never the best man , '' he said , `` I was always the good friend . ''   `` Oh ? '' I questioned .   `` I lived before death . I 've lived on far beyond my reckoning , and I have never been the brightest . And that is why I came here tonight to ask what you did with your life . ''   What did he mean ? Does n't it mean there is nothing I can do ? Do I have to give up on life ? Is the only option ?   `` I 'll start with your life , child , and then my life with another . And then , and then , and then ! Oh ! '' He said , gesturing for me to go on .   I did as he said , and then I was off on my way . I was n't very surprised by the fact that I was supposed to go home , so I went to the basement . I flipped on the lights and , for a split second , I saw myself standing near a beautiful woman on the steps .   `` Hello , young girl , '' the man continued , `` Would you like to know how many years ago I was with you , the man in the grey suit . ''   `` Yes , '' I replied .   `` And why did you become a man ? '' His voice was shaking now , and he was crying harder than ever .   `` My name is Tom , '' I said , tears rolling down my face . `` It is my time to say goodbye to you . ''   `` I 'm sorry , '' Tom said , trying to pull away . `` I was never the best friend . '' He choked out . `` I just met another man . Who I never became . I am sorry , I really am . ''   I did n't have much time . I grabbed the woman by the collar and held her close for a few seconds .   `` Are you sure ? '' I asked , trying to protect her .   `` Listen , child , '' Tom said , looking down at his hands . `` They are so beautiful . ''   I ran over and held out my hand as though I was fighting .   `` It takes a lot to lose people , '' Tom said , smiling . `` But I guess you can help me out . ''   `` How can you ? ! '' I shouted back , blood rushing to my lips .   `` I 've been taking you to the afterlife , '' he said . `` Every single day . You are the last one out . You are the last one to speak up . ''   I took his hand in mine again .   `` I 'm sorry , '' Tom said . `` I will always be . ''
`` Okay . So lets me get this straight , '' Paul says , grabbing a menu from the waiting room table . He looks at a few scenes .   As we exit the building , he motions for a chair .   `` We are free to sit down . ''   Paul shakes his head and picks up a new menu . He starts looking at the menu ;   `` What 're you guys thinking ? ''   The waiter enters the room .   `` That 's my first time in here . ''   Paul looks at the couple . He notices a blonde haired man in a suit carrying a package .   `` What 's this ? ''   The blonde , though dressed in a suit , puts a package under the table .   `` This is a package that will cost $ 10-35 million . How can you refuse ? ''   Paul checks the price .   `` The amount is $ 5 million . ''   Paul looks at the waiter .   `` This is a package that will cost $ 10-35 million . How can you refuse ? ''   The waiter enters the room .   `` Right . That 's my first time in here . ''   Paul looks at the waiter 's package .   `` That 's my first time in here . ''   Paul looks at the door .   `` Is it a package that wo n't cost $ 5 million ? ''   The waiter nods .   `` Right . This is a package that will cost $ 1.8 million . How can you refuse ? ''   Paul looks at the waiter .   `` What 's that ? ''   The waiter walks away from Paul . Paul looks around the restaurant .   `` This is a package that will cost $ 0.3 million . How can you refuse ? ''   The waiter walks back across the restaurant , leaving Paul alone .
He walked along the trail , following the same trail as his partner .   He slowed a bit , focusing on the sound of waterfalls and the quiet sounds of the ocean . He was happy with his partner , this would send a shock down everyone .   Finally , he stopped at the end of the trail and held his head in his hands . There was nothing special about him . He was just as handsome as his partner , if not more handsome than his *mate* .   He looked around his small cabin , at the few friends he had left in the cabin . They all seemed to know him . He knew some of them were not , but that was enough . He just needed to grab a drink , to relax .   He placed his head above his head and took a deep breath . He could n't bear to be around any of them . He just did n't want to keep looking at them .   He exhaled . He held the gun tightly against his temple . He needed to do something .   He slowly came to a stop , the sound of waterfalls becoming closer .   He looked up once more . The waterfalls were getting closer . As he looked closer , he realized it was water and a rock .   He looked down and saw a sharpening pain in his own arm . He looked away , disgusted . He laughed to himself , hoping something was wrong .   He leaned toward himself , ready to blow himself up . He looked over his shoulder to see a handsome , handsome man lying on the floor .   He quickly drew his gun , aiming for the man .  
Her last words were , `` I love you . ''   The tears filled her eyes , all the way down to the pit of her stomach .   I was a gentle man . I did n't mean it that way - I just wanted to call life a better place . And I hated that .   `` Love me , '' I finally said .   She could have sworn she heard me , but I was too scared to turn around . I walked back to the door and peeked inside . I sighed . I was lying on the couch .   *He 's asleep . * A voice said .   I looked at her and whispered , `` Goodnight . ''
`` I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to come up with something , '' he whispered into the phone . He shook his head and reached for the lock button .   I pressed the button .   My face flushed red and I rolled to the side . I was trapped , in this place for decades .   `` It 's okay , '' I said .   The phone beeped . The numbers were red . A smile crept on my face .   `` He 's here , '' my voice whispered . `` It 's been awhile now . ''   `` He 's here , '' his voice whispered . `` I 've loved you . ''   I felt tears well up in my eyes .   `` I love you , '' my voice whispered . `` I want you to come back . ''   `` I want you to come back , '' His voice whispered . `` I want you to promise me that you wo n't come back . ''   I could n't speak .   `` I want you to come back , '' His voice whispered . `` I want you to promise me that you wo n't come back . Please . Please . ''   My eyes began to tear up .   `` I love you , '' My voice whispered . `` I love you . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Thanks for reading ! If you like this story , check out my sub /r/Puns_are_Lazy .
There was a knock at the door and I opened it quietly , my heart swelled with excitement .   `` Timmy . Oh Timmy what 's wrong ? ''   `` It appeared I was n't going to be able to sleep well . I needed a glass of water before I went out to eat breakfast . Have you seen my family ? ''   `` No Timmy . ''   `` Wait , did you just want a glass of water ? ''   `` No . Wait , what ? ''   `` Timmy , I am not going to make your family cry , you would n't let them cry would you ? ''   `` What the damn . ''   I sighed heavily and let out a long sigh .   `` Look Timmy . Here 's a quick rundown of this . ''   Timmy sat down in his chair by the door and looked at me with a blank expression , until he said again   `` Timmy . Please , I have to get some water . ''   `` I 'm sorry baby , it 's just that I 've been having a panic attack , I had no idea what was happening . ''   I sighed again and looked at my oldest brother . The youngest of two .   `` Timmy , I do n't understand . I mean , I 've been having a panic attack for three whole days now ! My name is Aaron , is n't it ? ''   His eyes narrowed and his eyebrows furrowed .   `` Wh-What are you talking about ? ''   `` Timmy , I have been having difficulty sleeping . I 've been having trouble sleeping . I have to go tell my dad I 'm sorry . ''   `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` Your dad is also a vegetarian , you should help him up . ''   I frowned . `` I 'm sorry , you have to go ! ''   `` Timmy , please . ''   I closed the door and stood up from my chair .   `` Aaron , please , just leave me alone . ''   `` I do n't understand , Timmy . I know I did n't sleep well last night , I can understand this . Can you explain it to me ? ''   `` I would n't . I 'm sorry but I do n't know what to say right now . ''   I lowered my voice in exasperation .   `` Timmy , you are going to need to go find your dad . You got ta go find whoever else you need to find him . ''   I stared . My little sister was in the room now . She was missing something , I could n't see it , it looked like it was left in the drawer , I could feel it . My father was standing there , looking at me with a blank expression on his face .   `` Timmy , you have to leave . ''   I froze . I dropped my head in defeat . *That was it , what did I do ? God , I would have killed her not to leave , would I not have killed my little sister ? ! *   I felt my last breath .   `` I ... I think ... Timmy , I think I saw something . Someone . My head ! ''   I held my head .   `` There 's blood on it . ''   I whispered gently .   `` Timmy , I think I saw something . ''   I woke up on the floor . I was soaked in blood and I felt my face get pale . I tried to stand , but my legs were limp . I looked around , the pain was getting worse . I was worried .   `` Timmy ? Timmy ''   I looked around . My parents were in a dark room . My dad was in a white house . My sister was standing alone now . All the lights were off .   `` Aaron , you have to get out ! ''   I tried to move but my hands were bound . My chest was going to jump out of my chest . I looked from my mother to Timmy and back to my brother . My breathing was short and labored . I looked around again and saw the door on the other side of the room banging slightly .   `` Timmy , I do n't know what happened . ''   `` Okay Aaron . We need help . '' 
He was silent . He was still . He knew he had to hide . He had to make it . He was going to be alone in this woods . Many had came for him . Some were lost . Many were afraid . They had come all those years ago to seek refuge .   It was difficult ; he had made mistakes . He had failed before . He had failed before . He tried . He could not find his way back .   As he lay in wait for the rest , he realized that they had not found him . He had failed before . He tried .   He would not die alone . He would not die alone .
My favorite book is https : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2gctm/wp_youve_been_found_in_the_devil_and_the_monster_immediately_definitely/   *****   `` My friends , are you okay ? '' I called , wiping a hand on my suit , trying to hide the tears around my eyes . What was she thinking ? `` I 'm ... I 'm fine . ''   I raised my hand to her face . She looked up at me , tears welling up . I did n't have to ask her that , that was all I needed . I just needed to know that she was okay .   So , I turned on my heel and stomped on the sidewalk to find another empty street .   *****   It was n't so bad anymore . I walked down the street from where I came from and found the diner . The place was nice , and a nice bar . It was hot . The bartender looked at me for a second and tried to calm the nerves . `` Sorry for the wait . '' He said , looking back at the menu . `` You 'll pay for the drinks . ''   He nodded cheerfully . `` Ahhhh ! '' I nodded and pulled out a plastic bowl from inside a carton . `` Well , it 'll get a little cold for you . ''   He handed me a bottle of whiskey , and I downed it . `` Alright , '' he said , and took the glass away from me . `` But you 'll have to walk right up to the counter . ''   I walked up and offered him a whiskey . He poured it down . `` So , what do you think of 'The Leviathan ' ? ''   He nodded . `` Yeah , like how the legends go . It 's like a giant floating serpent . Like , towered over the entire city , with wings , and ... um , bigger than anything you 've ever seen . '' He looked at me . `` But , I suppose you can guess what it is then . Its like the shape of a dragon . ''   I nodded . `` How about we ask you something for it . '' I asked . He looked at me . `` I dunno , okay ? '' I nodded . `` But ... would you like to trade it for food ? ''   He shook his head . `` Sure , '' he said .   *****   I dropped the bottle on the counter . I picked it up and walked up to him . `` Are you okay ? '' I asked . He looked at me . `` Uh ... ok . ''   He looked at me . `` You 're not , are you ? ''   I turned away from him and walked away from him , towards where I came from . I walked back to where I came from , down the street . From where I came from , down the street , down the street , down the street .   I did n't care to know that she was okay .   *****   I stood beside her when I got the call from the hospital . It read , `` Patient 19 , is there anything you can do to help ? ''   I shrugged . `` Well , you see , he was a freak , and you have to come with me . ''   She stood up and walked up to me . `` Are you sure you want to help ? ''   I nodded . `` Of course . You can just let me escort him home . ''   She smiled , almost slyly . `` I guess so . ''
`` I do n't want to pay a debt . A simple debt , a day 's rent , a day 's notice . But you ca n't take my word for it . I have a wife ; we ca n't afford to have two children . All I need is the extra money . '' He paused for a moment before speaking again . `` You can do it , '' he said , `` for me , and for myself . Just tell me , how your day went , and if you want it done . ''   `` I do n't love you . ''   `` That 's not your problem . Why would you do that ? ''   `` I love you . I do it because you love me , but I need someone to love me for good . ''   `` So- so what are you going to do with it ? ''   `` I 'll just let you go . ''   He looked down at his watch . It read 3:12 . He walked out of the alley and onto the street . He turned around and walked down the street . He had never seen anyone so happy .
`` What ? '' He asked , confused .   Lucifer himself stared at him , then back up at the Big Guy .   `` You know , there were really no rules . ''   `` No rules . ''   `` Well , I suppose , but they were n't really rules . They 're just ... simple . ''   `` You mean ... when they died ? What happens to them ... what does it mean to be a good person ? ''   Lucifer tilted his head to one side in confusion , then moved towards his creation . He had always hoped it would find a way to come to terms with his imperfections .   `` I mean ... they 're ... horrible beings , they 're ... destructive . ''   God stared at him .   The Big Guy took a step back .   `` You know , some good people got killed off early on in their lives . Their bodies burned , their hearts exploded , their minds dissolved , and then they never came out . ''   Lucifer looked back up and saw God frowning .   `` Then they died . So they went to Heaven . ''  
It 's been nearly two months since I discovered my power . I was born with it , I raised it , and I have begun to test it out . It 's been almost two weeks since the first test . I 'm doing some tests , taking samples , trying to figure out what it is . Today , I found out the answer . Today , the answer is the same . Today , the answers are the same . Sometimes , it sounds like a mantra , sometimes , it sounds like a sentence . Sometimes , it sounds like a question . Today , it sounds like a question . Today , I think it may be , you know , a question . I look out over the courtyard . The students are restless . Why am I here ? Who is this teacher ? What is she doing here ? I wave to the group , asking them why I am here . I do n't know why , I do n't know who , and I do n't know what it 's like to be alone . I look down at my hands . I see nothing . I look for a response to the mantra . I look around , and see nothing . I look back up to the group , and see nothing . I look back down , and see nothing . I look back up , and see nothing . I look back up , and see nothing . I look back up , and see nothing . I look back up , and see nothing .
*I have n't wrote anything that 's written for a while now , so I 'd appreciate any criticism : ) *   In January , after the diagnosis , a newly discovered virus began infecting the United States . It 's a type of viral infection that kills you , causing your brain to burst . It spreads like wildfire , killing your organs , rendering you incapable of function . There is no cure , and this virus is already spreading , spreading through every human on the planet . The United States government is hiding these viruses , but we have a few others out there who believe it 's real . The President has been shot several times in the chest , and he has been seen coughing and sweating . The President has been injured and covered in blood . There is no way to save him . He will be killed by whatever sickness he spreads . *   In February , the virus spread like wildfire , engulfing the country . It spread like a plague , tearing apart the very fabric of the American national budget . The military has been hiding these mutations in secret , but they are still working on new ways to protect the American people from these diseases . The government wants us to work together as best we can , as best we can . We will create a new government that will take to the skies to protect the American people . We will begin training in our military training , and will teach the Marine Corps how to handle these diseases , and how to make them look like they are . We will teach the Navy how to handle these viruses , and we will build a huge Navy that will take the skies and take all the air they can with them . We will build the Navy the size of Chicago , and we will raise the government high enough to protect the United States citizens from these diseases . We will raise the army of New York City , and we will keep building the Pentagon . Our military will make the Pentagon look like it could ever be a chance for a free world . We will protect our people from these illnesses . Everyone is excited to see the new government , and we will keep building it . It will take three months to build , and then four months to build . We will build great military bases , and they will help build them around the world . They will protect us from this virus , and they will protect each other from these diseases . The fighting will continue , and tomorrow we will help launch a manned missions across the globe , to find them . We will not hide these viruses , but we could try to make a small group of people fight the virus , and we can create a small group that will protect each other . We will get to keep the fighting going , and they will protect us from these diseases . They will fight each other until one day , they will break one another , and when one of them breaks apart , they will destroy the other . *   In November , the virus spread like wildfire , engulfing the whole entire world . There is nothing we can do now . Our military is gone , and the rest of the world has been wiped out . We have no way to save ourselves . We have no way to save those pesky humans , or those stupid mosquitoes . They are still living together , and they have no way to know about this virus . They do not know . All they know is that we will find them .

The sound of metal on metal , echoed through the empty hallway . `` So this is it ... '' The group 's leader said .   `` We 're all dead , '' replied the leader , with a grin . `` Everyone . ''   The group went into a hall , which led into a small room . The leader stepped around it , and revealed a small metal door that led to a room full of chairs , many tablecloths , and a wall of books . The leader removed the books from the wall , and turned to the group in amazement . Behind him , a group of scientists sat around a small computer ; it was already hooked to a wire .   `` Well , this is it ... '' The leader said , smiling .   The scientists stared at the computer , then back at them . They took off their glasses and dangled them in front of their faces .   `` The first test ... '' The leader said . `` Will be fun ... ''   `` ... '' The group replied .   The scientist took off his glasses and placed them on the scientists ' heads . `` This has it ... '' He said .   `` We 're going to die , '' said the leader . `` Because we can both die . ''   `` No ! '' The group gasped .   Their leader looked at the computer . `` You 're going out because you 're having fun , you 're going out because you 're having fun , you 're going out because you 're having fun , but you 're not participating ! ''   The group kept on laughing , until the scientist told them he thought they were insane . He laughed harder and harder and screamed . He screamed for his friends to stop , but the other students ignored him and followed him .   The leader put his glasses back onto the heads again . `` That 's why we 're all dead , you know , '' He said . `` Everyone . ''   `` Well , this is it ... '' The group replied .   `` No ! '' The leader yelled .   There was a loud bang , and a bright light flashed across the room . The scientist slumped on the table , as a bright light streamed out of the computer and hit the scientist .   The man screamed in pain , and fell to the floor , like a ragdoll .   `` Why does this happen , '' he said . `` Why ca n't I just die ... ''   He stared at the computer , then at the group of scientists . `` This is it , '' he said , with a smile . `` We 're all dead ! ''   He shut the computer and stood up . He went down the stairs and sat down beside the computer , and walked over to the group .   `` So , this is it ... '' He said .
`` Man , I thought the place was pretty weird . ''   He was wearing a lab coat . Maybe he did n't understand it either , but he did n't have to try to make conversation . It was n't his fault he had to live in that apartment , he just needed to *see* it .   I was there just the same as him . I looked at my watch : six hours prior , 2:30 , the moment he walked through the door and saw it .   `` I could have sworn there were hundreds of thousands of cameras around here with me . ''   I ignored him . `` Yes . I see the same problem . And the same problem . See ? ''   `` I do n't know , man . We 're never going to see each other again . '' He gestured at the cameras . `` No one is going to talk to us again . ''   I felt a strange sense of pride . `` That is a great sign for humanity , because of this . ''   `` Yeah ? ''   `` I mean , this place is *great* , man . And , yeah , the place is *so* fucked when we walk through here . Also , we 're going to talk to each other once in a while . '' Another moment passed , like he was reading me a prescription . `` I see . But- ''   `` I just need to get back to work . '' He crossed his arms . `` I 'm going to use the bathroom . ''  
The vault was a bustling expanse of sand , and the city was beautiful . However , the darkness that surrounded it made it quite difficult for the human mind to process sight more clearly . In the distance , from a faint ringing in the distance , a figure raised his arms in the air , holding a gun .   `` Oi ! '' He called out , his voice sounding like it came out of nowhere . The man was wearing a purple jumpsuit , which was a bit odd considering his appearance .   `` What the hell are you doing ? ! How dare you touch me ! '' The man sounded almost enraged .   `` What kind of person would do that to one of our children ? ! ''   `` Yeah , we give them that to protect them from some crazy creature . We watch them everyday , like we did before they were born , and it 's like they 're watching us . ''   `` I see , but why are you walking in this direction ? ''   `` They 're stuck here ! ''   `` What are you talking about , then ? ''   `` What do you mean ? ! ''   `` They 're stuck here ! ''   `` So they 're trapped here ? ''   `` I do n't know ! ''   `` So they 're stuck here ? ''   `` Oi ! ''   *Ahem*   `` I wish for this to be over , so that we can spend the rest of our lives in peace . ''   `` What do you mean ? ! ''   `` Well , we 're trapped here , and that means that this is where we work . That means that we can spend the rest of our lives in peace . Everyone is trapped here , because we 're stuck here . Now ... maybe you should come back to us , or something . ''   He turned to the camera and showed what appeared to be an old man standing in a white room . He wore green glasses , which were very strange .   `` This is your sanctuary , '' he repeated , looking into the camera . `` You 'll be back shortly . '' Again , he disappeared .   `` What happened to your children ? ''   `` You 'll remember much , you see . ''   *Ahem*   `` What were these things ? ''   `` It 's really the only thing keeping you company . We have to be constantly shifting , trying to catch up on ourselves . ''   `` What about your kids ? ''   `` They 're kids , and they 're still growing up . ''   `` ... why ? ''   `` Because you 've been making this place harder for us . ''   `` But why ? ''   `` I know , some things are harder , and some things just get harder . You 'll need to rebuild , because we need you to do the things we love . So , how will you continue to strive to continue this world ? ''   *Ahem*   `` Fine . I 'll give you back what you came here for . ''   `` You are free , '' the old man said , and returned to his machine . He turned and walked away , as if daring someone in the dark to come investigate .   `` Hey , are you going to stop working ? I always wanted to start a new place . These jobs are still my passion . ''   `` Am I going to hurt you ? ''   `` No , you 'll not . ''   `` Well , you better start looking for something to do with my children . ''   `` Can I ask why ? ''   `` Are you going to kill us ? ''   `` No , no , I 'm not going to kill you ! ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because you 've been making this place harder for us . ''   `` Look , I did nothing wrong . What about my children ? ''   `` They 're starting to wither . You 're going to need to rebuild . ''   `` What happened to my children ? ''   `` Look , you 're just really stubborn , so you have n't even done your job yet . Stop blaming this problem on yourself . ''   The man , who had previously been a janitor , was now staring at a wall as
`` I hate people . ''   `` It *did* happen '' I interjected confused .   `` Did n't ? ! '' my grandfather yelled at me .   `` Well , I do n't think there is a way it could have happened ''   `` Do you not understand my language ? Did you just say that ? ''   `` Oh , that all sounds that way , but it happened a long time ago . Because of that '' his voice was steady but unamused .   `` What is it now ? '' I asked as I set down the table and gathered my things .   `` Well , you were a very nice person and you were very nice at school . It 's been a long time since we 've had a real conversation and we need a little chat . What does this mean ? ''   `` It means that you have a great family . And you are the best person anyone will ever have . ''   `` Oh god , I remember being very good at my job , '' I tried to think about everything . Everything had always been about my family , yet now I was about to get thrown off .   `` This means that you are the best person anyone will ever know . And then you came along . ''   `` I 'm sorry Grandpa ? ''   `` Well , that 's not quite right . You 're going to live very long , but that is not going to be enough ''   `` So , what now ? ''   `` Well , you 're going to be the best person anyone will ever have . ''   `` Oh shit ... '' I stumbled out of the room .
Part 1   `` I know this sounds crazy , but I swear , it 's an actual relationship . It 's just ... that I feel the same way about myself every single day . I think some things are ... different in every way . ''   `` Oh yeah , '' I said , `` but can you imagine what the world would be like without you ? Without me , nobody would have to worry about anything . No matter how angry they are , they 're just happy here with me . They 're just happy here with me . ''   `` And what would you be thinking about ? '' she asked , `` would you be happy living with anyone else ? ''   `` I 'd be happy being able to come home , '' I said , `` and having my happiness be destroyed by nothing . But at times , I had to find someone else before I left . I 'd have to go to work , just like I originally wanted . I 've never had the opportunity to find someone else before . Besides , sometimes I really hate myself for that ... ''   `` Please , '' she pleaded , `` just tell me what it 's like if I had a girlfriend instead of you . ''   `` A boyfriend ? '' I asked , `` How long will it take you to figure that out ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' she said , `` It really is n't worth it . ''   I laughed . `` I guess there 's no point in saying that . ''   She looked up at me . `` Oh , '' she said , `` Just tell me what it 's like if I had a boyfriend instead of you . ''   `` Anything , '' I said , `` Just tell the truth . ''   `` You do n't know , '' she said , `` but ... it 's always been the same . ''   `` Uh , okay ? '' I said , `` Like ? ''   `` Like , never have I known you before . ''   `` Do n't you know , '' she said , `` that you never had a boyfriend because you never knew me ? ''   `` I do n't ... ''   `` No , I do n't know , '' she said , `` And like , I do n't know what you 're talking about . ''   `` You do n't know , '' I said , `` Because you always loved me , but you always hated me . ''   `` You 've loved me ? '' she asked , `` And how could you love me ? ''   `` Because like , your body has always loved me , but you never had one . ''   `` How can that be true ? ''   `` It ca n't . ''   `` I 'm sorry ? ''   `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` I ca n't see it anymore , '' she said .   `` We 're not together anymore , '' I said , `` and you are the one who really puts on her facade . You 're the one who always leaves ! You 're the one who makes me feel better ! ''   `` I love you ! '' she yelled , `` I love you ! ! ''   `` Yes , '' I said , `` I love you too , '' and she hung up .
*The lamp is quite dark , but I was content . He is indeed a genie . *   Harry stepped out from under the lamp , and looked deep into the eyes of the mortal in front of him , who was beginning to understand that this was what he was going to receive the most . He knew that he 'd be famous and beloved , and it was only a matter of time before they were captured . All he had to do was convince the devil that this was what he thought he was going to receive .   After a few moments of pondering , Harry had decided that Harry would be a great man . He would become the greatest villain on Earth , and everyone was happy .
`` Alright everyone . Let 's get this straight . You know how many people have names on their wrist ? ''   `` Let 's get this straight . ''   The members of the council looked at each other . Those still looking up at the name . They looked down at their wrist , and at the hands they held . It was just ... Different . Each one had some kind of tattoo on it , or perhaps some sort of sign . Some were probably a red , or some plain tan . There were some of them ... but that was n't important ... They were all the same . They were all a single name .   People looked up at the sky . It was a pretty pretty day , and the sun was just beginning to set . The world was n't supposed to be this quiet . Nobody had any names , and nobody except for those other names in the world . And everyone wanted to be recognized . Everyone was good at it . Their names were better than theirs . The world was different .   `` So , I 'm John Doe . '' The council leader spoke slowly .   Everyone took a step back . They had one .   `` Uh , how do you know that ? ''   `` Oh , I know . '' The leader replied quickly , trying to keep his voice low .   `` What do you mean , you know . Do you know why ? ''   `` Well , I do n't think so . '' John Doe interrupted . `` I 've never heard of this . I do n't think it 's so easy . ''   `` Well , I suppose . It 's simple . '' The council leader replied .   `` Because they 're great at it . '' John Doe continued .   `` So what if you killed someone ? '' The council member asked .   `` Oh , no . I killed someone . '' John Doe replied slowly .   `` Well ... So who *are* they ? '' The Council leader asked .   `` Oh , I guess . I think everyone else is either Captain John Doe or ... Rick Sanchez . ''   The air around them became very quiet , and everyone looked towards each other .   The world was n't supposed to be this quiet ...   `` I guess there 's some sort of lottery machine going on downstairs ? '' The council leader asked .   `` Yep . '' John Doe responded slowly .   `` So you 've got a contest to win . '' The council leader announced .   `` What should I do ? '' The council leader asked .   `` Whatever you want . '' John Doe replied .   `` Whatever you want . '' The council leader said , holding up a hand .   `` So ... I 'll take what 's yours . '' John Doe replied .   Everyone watched as Rick Sanchez took out a random thing from his pocket .   `` Sorry , '' The council leader said , handing it to the council leader . `` I got ta tell you something . ''   `` No sense in denying it . '' Rick Sanchez said .   `` You 're the Captain John Doe ? '' Rick Sanchez asked , standing slowly .   `` Yeah . '' The council leader said .   Rick Sanchez tried to get back onto his feet , and he tried to pull himself back into his car . The car was closed , and the sky was beginning to clear . He looked back at his wrist . The tattoo on his wrist was nothing but a red , or maybe some plain tan .   Everyone turned to look at him .   `` Oh , for all your money , John Doe . '' Rick Sanchez said . `` Can I have a card ? ''
`` Honey , I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry.. ''   I wish I 'd be happier , to be able to rest in peace .   `` Babe , I 'm so sorry . Here we are . We 've lived ... ''   I can feel her tears are drawn down my face .   `` Let me hold you back , honey . ''   `` I 'm sorry , Mommy . You have to listen to me . ''   She pushes away , tears rolling down her cheek , `` Please honey , please listen , Mommy . I 'll stop loving you . I *will* stop loving you . I 'll stop making you cry . ''   Her voice screams out for me to hold on to her , to stop it , that 's all she needs .   `` I 'm so sorry , Mommy . I 'm so so sorry . It 's been so long , I just ca n't stop loving you . Come on , it 's time to make it better . ''   Her voice falls silent once again .   `` I 'm so miss mommy . You still need to listen to me , honey . ''   `` Just give me a little bit of time , okay ? ''   I let her be . I let my face sink in to the little girl 's little chest . I let my breath out , keeping my fingers on her soft , lilac neck as if the baby I would love for the rest of my life would go on to be born again .   `` She 's okay . ''   `` I know , honey . She 's a good kid . And she deserved it . Just give me a little bit . ''   Her voice does n't give me time to say anything . Her tears are still flowing down her cheek . It is too heavy .   `` Please Mama , please , just give me a little bit -- ''   I ca n't finish the sentence as my body breaks down from sheer lack of strength . I have to hold on to something longer .   `` Okay , okay . Just ... . ''   If I ca n't continue , my body will not cooperate with any force .   `` I 'm so sorry . ''   `` I 'm so sorry . ''   `` -C-could you just tell me the name of this little girl ? ''   It 's my daughter , my little daughter . She will never know her voice .  
Totally terrible .   I wish you were already aware . My entire life I looked forward to eating meat , just to learn the secrets of the universe and the universe . But alas , you have never been this proud of yourselves . I am your sole survivor , an empty shell trapped in this world . How many times did you try to kill , to eat it , to become free and to live and die as one ? How many times do you try to save me ?   I am the last survivor . I can not bear to live .   I will continue to eat you until I die .   I will kill you , until you are finished .   I will eat you until you are done .   I will move on , until there is no more food .   After the initial stages , I have begun to feel more alive . I feel that I am going to be able to feel more of you , and more of your body . I am truly happy .   But wait . What is this feeling ? Nothingness ? I am as happy as ever .   I am sorry .   I am hungry .
`` Shit ! '' I screamed over and over again , shaking my head in excitement . I kept on turning the television on , hoping to see what the news would be . I was still in the middle of picking up the groceries that were supposed to be delivered to my house and then my parents would come home to see if I was ok. I ran over to the kitchen to grab some leftover eggs but then I heard my daughter scream into the kitchen .   `` Mommy ! ''   `` What 's wrong ? ''   `` He 's been crying at the dinner table . ''   `` What are you doing ? ''   `` Are you okay ? No , he is n't . He just ... it 's weird . He does n't want to talk . ''   I slammed the door shut and looked around . I did n't know why they were saying that . The first few people that came into the kitchen were just typical parents . They were friendly and polite , their smiles always looked genuine .   `` Why do n't you stop worrying , '' I said , grabbing my keys off of the table and walking up to the door .   `` It 's just that mommy 's crying . ''   `` She 's crying ? Who are you ? Did we call 911 ? ''   `` No , she 's here , '' I said pointing menacingly at the door . She looked at me for a moment . `` Just go leave . '' She whispered to her daughter and left at that . Outside the house , I could hear the woman 's footsteps making their way towards the front door . I was furious . I stood there for what seemed like ages , searching for my daughter and watching her walk by . I felt a sudden urge to throw up .   Then I remembered my phone number . I picked it up and called 911 immediately .   Two minutes passed and I was still in shock , unable to speak , not sure what to say . Then , the voices came in again .   `` Mommy ! '' I yelled out to her .   `` What the fuck are you ? ''   `` He 's come home . ''   I turned around , and saw her face , framed by thick black glasses , staring blankly at me . I felt bad for her and reached my hand out to help her out . The woman stared at me nervously . Then , after two minutes of silence , she said , `` I 've been watching you all day . It 's almost time . Go to your room and meet someone . ''   As soon as I left , the two doors opened and a group of people walked in . They were all women , all covered in blood , and I realized I was in the middle of their body .   `` Mommy ! '' The woman cried .   `` What the fuck is wrong with you , '' I yelled , pointing my finger at her . `` Put your hands up and yell at me ! '' I yelled , looking like a puppy .   `` Mommy , what the fuck do you want ? '' The woman asked , looking at me intensely . I looked at her , trying to process what just happened . The woman looked at me , confused .   `` You 're him ! '' The woman yelled again , her heart racing .   I tried to look at her . She was looking at me , confused . I walked away from the woman 's body and looked at my phone again . I did n't know why I was wearing sunglasses or who the voice was . Then I heard the woman scream .   `` PLEASE GET OUT ! '' I screamed . I sat there awkwardly , not even sure what to do . My eyes moved toward the door . There was a knock at the door . And then , the woman burst through the door , holding onto its frame . The door crashed shut with a loud *CRACK ! *   I fell onto the ground , shaking my head in bewilderment .
`` Go ! '' I shouted as the man ran after me , his bare feet hitting the pavement in short bursts . I stopped dead on the trail , my mouth agape .   The man 's boots came off the ground in a pool of blood . I could hear his voice echoing around me . The man was clearly not alone . The creatures began to surround me , my feet dragging me to the ground . I began to sob , but the creature was not moving . I lay there , helpless , barely able to feel my body . As I cried , I heard the creatures whisper `` Go ! ''   I began to cry . I began to cry . I began to cry .   The creatures grew closer and closer . The man was closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer just as they began to speak .   `` Go ! ''
It was a Sunday night , and the parents were n't home yet . They had a few beers and a few jokes to pick out . Mary had been working the job for the past two days and had n't seen an adult in a while .   `` Hello ? '' Mary asked , looking around the dark woods . Her brother Greg had called her in and talked to her on the phone as she worked .   There was a knock on the door , and Mary let out a yawn . `` Is someone here ? '' she asked , her eyes fixed on the door . It was n't Greg . She looked again , the smile on her face starting to fade . Maybe a ghost had entered her room ? She closed the door and slid into bed , listening carefully for any ghostly noises . She heard the knock again , and opened her eyes .   The door was closed , and there was a faint , faint sound from outside . She slowly opened the door to find a shadowy figure standing there , staring at her . `` Hello ? '' she repeated , her voice cracking . But , as she looked up , the figure sat down on the couch . `` Mary ? '' she asked . She opened the door and took a seat by the door . `` Hello ? '' she repeated again , her voice echoing through the darkness of her bedroom . `` Is someone here ? '' she asked again .   `` How long has it been ? '' the figure asked . She looked over at Greg , the figure still with him . He was n't looking back , he just moved his head back to the window . `` I thought I saw one coming , '' she said .   `` Did you - '' He began , as his voice trailed off . `` Did you hear me ? '' He asked , his voice becoming silent .   Mary stared at the ceiling . `` Yes ! '' she exclaimed , her voice finally calming .   `` And did somebody tell you , Mary ? '' Greg asked , leaning back into the chair . He took a few strides and leaned against the door . He watched her , eyes wide . `` Is it him , Mary ? '' he asked , his voice growing louder as he heard her say it .   `` I ca n't hear you ! '' she screamed , her voice growing more and more irritated .   `` I can feel your heart beating , Mary . And mine too , '' Greg said , his body rising up and falling off the couch . The figure looked at Mary , his eyes opening wide . `` What happened ? '' he asked , his mouth open to reply .   `` I woke up alive in my bed , Mom , '' she said , her voice still shaking .   `` What happened ? ''   `` I woke up here , '' she said , her fingers shaking . `` I was in a hospital bed , and I was in the hospital , and I ... '' She trailed off , her voice now sobs sounding out to the empty room . `` I felt so bad , and I thought I ... ''   `` Did you ... did you feel pain ? '' Greg asked , his voice now in a whisper .   `` ... did I feel pain ? '' Mary asked , her voice quieter now .   `` Yes ! '' Greg replied , his voice now sounding more and more angry than before . `` I was in a car accident , and I did n't feel the car properly . I was going mad , I did n't feel the car properly . In one shot , I was on my way to school - and I hit a window and ... ''   Mary held onto him for a moment , tears streaming down her face . `` I ca n't go ! '' she begged , her voice now shaking . `` I just ... '' she said , her voice cracking .   `` One shot ? '' Greg asked , his voice now cracking . `` One shot ! '' he repeated , his voice now making a faint noise .   Mary looked at him , tears running down her face . `` One shot . One shot . '' she sighed , her voice now shaking . `` I knew it would happen . I just ... '' she said , her voice now cracking .   `` There was somebody in an alley , '' Greg said , his voice now cracking . `` He shot me in the back , and I was dead . I knew I would die . I just wanted to embrace my Mom ... ''   Mary stood up , pulling herself from the chair and looking at Greg . He lowered his gun , and pointed it toward her . She held out her hand , and he took one . `` One shot . One shot . '' she said , her voice now shaking .   As they slowly walked home

`` Is that ? ''   `` No ''   `` Then it 's a ... ''   I ran my index finger through my hair , and noticed I had a tattoo that read `` NO '' on my forearm . I scratched it , and looked it up , and saw that I had a dragon in my left hand .   `` Hello . '' I said , hoping for the best . To be honest , I had no idea what I was supposed to do with my friends at school , but this was so weird .   `` Look . A dragon is very rare . ''   I checked my wrist `` No . That 's not possible . ''   `` Well , my birth mark is a dragon ! Why ? '' I asked .   `` Well ... your brother Adam is always a fantastic guy . ''   `` He has the most awesome clothes , and he has the best food . ''   `` I have a wonderful girlfriend , '' I said .   `` She is also very smart as well . ''   `` Is she a dragon ? ''   `` No , but she was very intelligent . ''   `` What is she ? ''   *A dragon ! ? *   `` A pretty girl . Like , *very* smart . ''   Adam looked at me with a smile , and said , `` Yes . ''   `` What was that ? ''   `` Well ... you make me very comfortable sometimes at night . '' I made a noise so loud that nobody heard it , and put my arm around her , and kissed her on the forehead .   `` Thank you ''   `` You made me very comfortable , '' she said , and got up .   I was laying on my bed with the dragons head in my lap , completely naked with me around it , so I could n't see what was going on . What it was was ? Did the doctor get into it ? Was it a figment of my imagination ?   I checked my pocket again : `` Adam , you are definitely not dreaming . ''   `` No ! I ... '' He said .   I smiled , and hugged him , and shook his hand .   I got up , and walked over to the bed again , and grabbed my phone .   `` I hope you have the courage to call that number . ''   `` You are right , '' I said .   *Click ! *   `` Hello ? ''   `` Yeah , I 'm getting it '' she said .   I laughed . And made a noise so loud that nobody heard it , but the doctor was still talking .   `` Wow ! '' He exclaimed , `` I never did see any results there . ''   `` Yeah ? ''   `` Yeah , yeah , I did . ''   *Click ! *   `` Hello ? ''   `` Hello ? ''   `` I 'm waiting for you . ''   `` Wait , is that human ? ''   `` Yes . ''   *Click ! *   `` Hello ? ''   `` No , he was in there at exactly the same time as you . If I have any questions , please come call me . ''   `` What ? Why are you here ? ''   `` I 'm sorry , but I will call you back tomorrow to pick you up . ''   `` Alright , '' I said .   `` Bye . ''   `` Bye . ''   *Click ! *   `` Hey , I hope your parents forgot to bring you your doctor 's prescription . ''   I laughed .   `` What ? ''   `` He has to get out of here soon . ''   `` I would n't want him to be in here anyway . ''   `` I 'm not going to sleep with him soon . ''   *Click ! *   `` What ? ! ? '' I exclaimed .   `` This is n't fair ! Get out of my bed and go get some medicine ! ''   `` He is n't leaving ! '' I yelled .   `` I have my medication . ''   `` My medication ? ! ? ''   `` Yes . ''
My father , once known as Saint , would long for a time before the world was ready . He spent his whole life dedicated to keeping the world safe from harm . For years at least he had been away from the danger , from the world , wherever that may be . As time passed and so did he . Years passed and so did his life . During those years , he would visit family and friends and try to focus on the things that his father had said . Some nights his father would say something in between bites , while others , after having been an open and loving man , would say `` How soon will this be over ? '' and , in the years that followed , he would say `` There 's nothing left to live for . ''   This was one of those nights , so long ago , when he still lived on , that he noticed something strange . The shadows in the sky , the voices in the trees , the people walking around him . He often found himself wandering around the woods like wild animals , listening for a few moments to the sounds of running water or the occasional wolf barking . He would sometimes find himself wandering around the forest through fields in hopes of finding someone who could help him , who would offer him food , or provide him with water to keep him going .   When the world went to shit , the noises of running water would suddenly get louder and louder . The world would be covered in the smoke and dirt that surrounded him . Even that was n't enough . One night , though , he heard two figures approaching him . The second figure was dressed in pink and black . The second figure spoke softly . `` Welcome to our home , Lord . It has been time for you to leave our world , for our people are not strong enough to live on without you . '' The lord said this , placing a calming hand on the lord 's shoulder . It did just that to calm him down .   `` Your people are strong enough to live on without you , Lord . You are a warrior . '' The lord said this , and the second figure continued to walk towards him . In the months that followed , he would move through the forest , past dark underbrush , through bushes in hopes of finding someone willing to help him . When the world was too good for him , he was called to save a girl in the woods .   When the world went to shit again , the shadows in the sky began to come into focus . He noticed a figure approaching him , with a strange pink and black dress . He could n't see what the figure was wearing . It did n't really resemble a person , but he could tell it was a human .   The shadow at his side shifted slightly , and the girl looked at the human . `` Halt young man . Do not be afraid . '' His voice was quiet and yet firm .   `` Thank you for your help , Lord . I would never hurt a girl again . '' The human appeared slightly taller than the two figures , and he looked as if he were going to be a hero . But , most importantly , the humans appearance , the skin , the colour , what he looked like . They had no eyes at all . It was as if he was looking at a photograph , and they could n't see anything .   The shadow suddenly transformed completely and walked towards the girl before her . After several seconds , he looked down at the girl and said , `` Oh dear . Your world belongs to me . '' The girl 's face seemed to change from hurt to pure terror . She looked up at him with concern , and then , with a voice , said , `` Are you sure you want to go back home ? Do you want to go away from this life ? Do you want to leave us all behind ? '' She looked down at the girl , then back towards the human . `` You are a great warrior , Lord . Please give us your best chance of life . '' She nodded and then she disappeared .   The Shadow at his side , now taller than the two figures , returned to normal , as was the way in which it had always been . He stood up from his bench and walked towards the house . As he entered his house , he heard the sounds of running water and , of running water , of crashing through the windows . He looked around and saw a scene around him that he had never seen before . Standing in front of a bed , was a woman . Her face consisted of a twisted mask , revealing a black and white mask that covered her face . She was sobbing hysterically .   `` Please leave me alone , Lord . This life is too dangerous for me . '' The woman said , but her words were already too late . She was gone .   The Shadow at his side sat down across from her , this time knowing that she could .
I have never had any luck . Well , not like luck , but it makes sense to me . Once the city was sacked , I had an entire wall in my place to protect the city from the hordes of beasts and monsters hiding in . The city was small , but even small , even to a man who lived a small town . And although I was able to protect the large city after the first rebellion against the town , I could never go far enough .   At first it was just people with food and water , but now it was just people who were scared to death for shelter . There were women and children to protect their children and children , and they were all afraid . My city was only a few miles from anywhere I had ever gone before . They believed I would be safe , but they were wrong .   There were people inside my city . There were monsters , and there was fire too . I knew what I had to do to get rid of them , and to no avail . In my case , I was safe . But not too safe .   I have no way of getting rid of them . I am trapped . I have no way of going out of my ways . I only know that I must leave my way , and I must live for eternity .   I will do this . I will stay away from this city . I will not go out into the darkness , or into the night . I will stay trapped . I will not go out into the cold , alone , and alone . I will not go into the night . I will not go out into the deep , and the cold . I will never go out .   As you could tell , I was n't afraid . It was time to get rid of these monsters . I needed to get rid of these monsters before the end .   I rose from the blackness , and walked over to the window . I could see the city below me , and I could see the city through the window . I could see the city beyond the window . I walked over and took a look at the city below me .   It was all I could see . The streets were filled with demons , giant demons , and the city below it was filled with demons . I could see myself behind these demonic scenes . But this was not my town . It was my city .   Now , back to the city below . This city is where the demons hide . This city is where the monsters hide . This city is where the demons hide .   ***   If you like this story , check out more of my writing at /r/OhLookItsAStory .
It was a beautiful day , the ocean wave pushing itself around the side of the ship that would soon come crashing down upon the tiny boat . Just as the ship was about to hit the water , the crew was able to see it over the water .   One captain jumped out of his chair , and started muttering to everyone in the crew . `` Sir , maybe they 're on it , '' a stewardess said .   `` Do n't make me , '' the captain said . `` This was supposed to be a cruise . Just two hundred years before the ship crashed we were supposed to be getting there . ''   `` But , what did it do to the boat ? '' the stewardess questioned .   `` Sir , it was our final push for the ship . We launched it into the water , and hit it at once . ''   `` But the crew survived , '' one of the crew members said . `` Sir , they 're not even getting to the ship . ''   `` Maybe this is the first time , '' yelled the captain . `` We 'll take these kids to the doctor . ''   All the sailors went to bed , and never woke up .   You could hear a knock on the front door , and a young woman came in , and asked if anyone remembered hearing that doorbell . The captain was surprised to find her , but after asking what she wanted , he replied , `` They were in the water , Sir . ''   The young woman stepped up to the captain , and asked him , `` What do you know of our ship ? How do you know that it 's going to crash ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' said the captain . `` I 've been watching it all day but I doubt it 'll do anything significant to anything significant to our ship . ''   The young woman answered back , `` I think it 's time we met , '' and before she could continue talking , the captain heard a knock on the front door . `` I think we 're going to need to meet her . '' Said the captain , and as soon as he said that , the doorbell rang again .   The young woman walked into the room , and asked , `` Uh , hi , '' the captain looked around , but nothing was there .   He turned around , and saw that there was a young man , wearing a suit , and standing next to the captain . He looked at the captain , and asked , `` Excuse me , are you alright ? ''   The captain was silent for a moment , and the young man said , `` You look so familiar , sir . ''   `` I 'm fine , '' said the captain . `` I 'm just going to check the ship . ''
`` I know why it 's called Pain '' .   *Silence*   `` It 's that drug we 've used , '' he continues , his hands folded behind his back . His tone is low , but somehow , so is mine . `` Every once in awhile , someone gets a little extra , you know ? ''   *Silence*   `` I know what you 're thinking , but you do n't know why . You see - everyone and every single one of us around here had Pain '' .   *Silence*   He stares at me for what seems like an eternity - a long and beautiful silence , each with its own unique meaning .   *Silence*   I do n't know why I 'm telling you this , but I know better than to listen to something that never ends .   *Silence*   I look at you . I know that you must know , because that is the most comforting thing I have ever heard .   *Silence*   *Silence*   `` Well , I digress . I do n't know why I 'm telling you this , all in all . ''   *Silence*   I do n't know why I should be here , but I know better than to listen to something that never ends .
The last time I saw her was when I was twelve . It was an old man named Eddy . He was a hard worker but not a very smart one . `` You know , '' I said , `` it 's pretty much the same , that kind of thing . '' He smiled at me and said , `` no wonder I 'm so busy . '' A few minutes later , I was fifteen and very happy . I met an old friend a few weeks after I died . She was a lovely girl and really kind , and she was very nice . I also met my dad a few years later . It was a nice thing since he loved me so much and was very friendly to me . We dated for a few months and for a long time , in fact , he loved me . I was very good at meeting people . We also were very poor , but loving people . We had an amazing time , but not so great that it was a lot of happier . We were very good friends and we loved each other very much . I was very happy and happy and I was very happy , and we lived very long . As such , I was very happy .   That is until the last time I saw Her . This time I was in Heaven . It took me quite some time , so I decided I would be happy again as well . I wanted to be very happy and everyone in paradise loved me very much . I was very happy .   I got to Heaven very soon . It was a nice place , but not very nice that much . I went to her and she looked very nice . `` Hello , '' I said , `` it 's me . '' I was very happy , but very unhappy . `` How is your day going ? '' She looked very nice . `` Oh , it 's great . '' I said , `` I 'm glad to be alive and all . '' She looked very nice . `` Can I speak to you ? '' I asked her . She looked very nice . `` What is your name ? '' She asked . `` I do n't know , '' I said . `` Uh , erm , it 's Harold , '' she said , `` I have a name . '' I said . She looked very nice . `` I 'm Harold . '' She asked . `` I 'll call you Harold , what is it ? '' I asked , `` Uh ... Uh . '' She said , `` I 'm so sorry . '' She looked very nice . `` I just must be very busy . '' She said , `` What is it ? '' I asked . `` I think its the Devil , '' she said , `` I do n't know what it is . '' I said . She looked very nice and I thought , `` I 'm almost glad you are alive and all . '' She looked very nice and I thought , `` It 's a nice place . '' She looked very nice , and I thought , `` Maybe this time I 'll be very busy . '' She smiled and waved at me . `` Hi , this is Harold , '' she said .   Harold was dead . I am dead . I was very happy and I was very happy . `` Is this Heaven ? '' I asked . `` Yeah , '' said Harold , `` this is Heaven . '' I said , `` So , is my life going to be bad ? '' I asked . `` Oh , it 's very bad . '' She said , `` Well , your life is probably bad so I guess it 's not pretty . '' I said . She looked very nice and I thought , `` Well , it might be better if I met a nice girl . '' She smiled and said , `` I hope you would rather live again . '' She looked very nice and I thought , `` Okay , okay , '' said Harold , `` I 'll see you soon . '' I looked very nice . `` Bye , Harold . ''
He pressed his fingers against the rock , and found nothing .   The ground was far too hot , and wet that there was a soft hum where the sun was shining -- the horizon barely visible through the thick and slimy layer of mist . There was a distant crack at the door .   He strained to open it . He did the only thing he could : flail his hands . It didn ’ t budge . He took a few deep breaths , and turned around to face the entrance .   A tiny creature ran out , the rest of its body covered in a thick patch of fog . Its clothing was thin and pale , and it had an odd pair of bright yellow eyes . It had a strange looking grin on its face -- but it didn ’ t look at him .   “ I come for your help , ” the little creature called out .   “ Who ? ”   “ The witch , of course , for a price. ”   “ Please , I must offer you a trade. ”   “ Oh , ” he said . “ I want to see the witch . She said that I needed you. ”   He looked away , and found only the silhouette of a small white figure lying on the threshold of his hut . He turned to face it , and found the witch had fled into the mist .   The old man stood there for a few minutes . “ Listen , ” he said , “ I ’ ve been traveling to that witch , and she ’ s told me that I need to help her . Perhaps there are others with the help as well . I can buy you a few supplies if you don ’ t mind. ”   The old man sighed . “ Alright . I ’ ll see you back soon. ”   There were other noises around . He looked back , which was nowhere near as scary as he expected .   He walked to the door and peered into a mirror . His face was cold and dry . He could hardly breath .   There was a long time left until the sun set .
`` Why do you love me so much ? It hurts so bad . '' Said Daddy .   `` I love you too Daddy . Please , tell me the reason . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` Why daddy ? Why are you making me do this ? '' Screamed Mrs. Clause .   `` I asked you to take care of my little girl . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` I asked you to do this now ! ! ! '' Screamed Mrs. Clause .   `` I told you to take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause ,   `` I said take care of her . Please take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause ,   `` I always wanted to go to the fair . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` Because I think she 's a great and smart girl . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` Because I hate her so much . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` Because I love you so much . Please please take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` Because I love you so much . Please take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` You 're doing nothing to me . I 'm not hurting you either . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` I ca n't help it . It hurts so bad . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` I want to hurt you . Please ! '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` I do n't want to hurt you either . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` I do n't want to hurt her . I want to hurt her . I want to hurt you . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` But I love you so much ! Please take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` I love you so much Daddy . Please take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` I really do . I just want to hurt you too . Please take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` Please take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` Please take care of her . '' Said Mrs. Clause .   `` I 'm sorry Daddy , but I love you so much . Please take care of her . '' And so Mrs. Clause fell from her great and smart girl , and the little blue bear fell from her great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart Girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the Great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great and smart girl , and she fell from the great
“ Tell me , ” I said , reaching into a cabinet along the wall . “ Why did I do this ? ”   “ Because I was supposed to . Did I not ? ”   “ You are too old to understand why I did this. ”   “ Why do you think I do this ? ”   “ Because you hate me. ”   “ Why ? ”   “ Because I hate you too. ”   “ Why do you think I do this ? ”   “ Because I hate you. ”   “ Why ? ”   “ Because you hate me. ”   “ Why ? ”   “ Because you hate me . You hate me , and I hate it. ”   “ What ? ”   “ Because you hate me , and you hate me , and you hate me , because you like me , and you hate me so much that you hate us , and so much that you hate us , and so much that you hate us , and so much that you hate us , and so much that we just hate you , and you hate us so much , that it makes you feel like you are going to die , and you hate us so much that you hate us so much that you want to die. ”   “ Why do I hate you ? ”   “ Because you hate me too. ”   “ Why ? ”   “ Because you hate me , and you hate us so much that we just hate you so much that you hate us , and so much that we just hate you so much that you hate us so much that you hate us too much that you hate us so much that you hate us too much of all the people you hate .

I watched her leave the tent . I felt her warm blood on my arms and arm . Not even the stench of sex was comforting enough . I always thought I was special . I always knew I would be . I just did n't like seeing her , and she always made me uncomfortable .   One day , I saw her . Her dark brown hair flowed down her shoulders . She wore her lab tops in black and white and she was there always with me . I was in awe of her . There she was . Alone in her tent , like all the others , frozen in time . But then she left . I watched as I never wanted to see her again .
`` You just told me to do it again ! ''   James had spent nearly every day in the factory . And every day he did it again . It was the first time he had seen his old factory owner .   `` I told you to do every day ! ''   James turned away . He never liked to be rude , but it was n't the first time he had done it . It was the first time he had ever let it down . He did n't want to be rude anymore . James knew it would n't happen . He did n't want to have to be rude anymore .   `` Now you 're just saying 'you do n't like it when you do it anymore . ' ''   James was surprised when he saw his old factory owner now . His face was a mask of despair . James looked at him in disappointment , even though it was the first time he had come to see his old factory maker . Maybe it was the last time he ever did it again , and then he would have to let it go . His family was dead now . They had n't been able to live long enough to afford to have their daughter .   James was angry , and his anger changed . His anger changed , slowly , as if he was going to fight back . He made a promise to himself , and he made the promise that he would find out soon .   He went to his workshop . He picked up the hammer , and began to use the hammer .   `` No , no , no ! '' cried James . `` Please , let me continue ! ''   The hammer stopped , and there it was . A small silver cylinder with a single button .   `` Yes ! '' James shouted , reaching out to press a button .   The cylinder exploded . James screamed , and cried , and cried .   The sound of the hammer hitting the floor filled the factory .   `` NO ! '' James screamed . He threw the hammer at the wall , and there it was . The small silver cylinder .   `` NO ! '' James yelled , and cried , and cried .   The hammer fell . James screamed , and cried , and cried .   And he did n't want to be rude anymore .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   ^^^^first ^^^^time ^^^^writing , ^^^^please ^^^^give ^^^^a ^^^^little ^^^ ^^^^ CC
I was looking into the bottle when the car pulled onto the bridge . Through the window , I could see the town below . The quiet blue sky hung over the town , and I was leaning against a large oak tree . The streetlights flickered to life on the bridge , illuminating the town below , and I could see the train jostling . I had heard the stories about men in armor who traveled the country , but they told nothing back then .   I looked back to see a woman with a bright red haired woman . She looked up at me , and began to laugh . He smiled back . She took out a bottle of champagne , and held it to her lips . I took a sip , and continued to smile .   `` Is this a joke ? '' She frowned , and I took another drink . `` I ... I keep telling you you she 's my wife . ''   `` What ! Are you kidding me ? ! '' I exclaimed , `` It 's not even a joke , it 's a tragedy ! ''   She shook her head . `` That is not what I meant by it , '' she said , and paused . `` Everyone you know , except a few of them . We 're all dead . ''   `` You 're dead ? ! '' I was getting angry .   `` No , '' she said , `` You do n't know . Everyone you ever loved . Everybody who ever worked as a lawyer . All these years spent in that office . All because she killed someone else . ''   `` Why did n't I tell you ? ! ''   `` Because your husband chose you instead of me , because he thought you were dead . He could n't come up with a better way of killing your husband . ''   `` I did n't choose him ! ''   `` You always did . ''   `` No , I chose him . ''   `` Why ... you keep making me do this ? ! '' I screamed , and the whole town began to shake with panic .   `` Because your husband chose you instead of me . ''
“ It ’ s just a small sphere , aren ’ t they ? ”   “ No , no , it ’ s a little one of those things that ’ s going to hurt people . There ’ s just a tiny spark of light , and you can see it. ” The blonde scientist took a look in the camera lens . “ It ’ s just a little star . It ’ s spinning , just like a comet , which is making a little noise. ”   “ But… ”   “ It ’ s like a car or a bird . It ’ s talking to yourself . It ’ s really happy. ”   The blonde scientist turned to her colleague and shook his head . “ What do you mean ? ”   “ You can see more of it , but it doesn ’ t seem to be speaking to you. ”   “ But that ’ s not possible . What could it possibly mean ? ”   “ I don ’ t know . You know it ’ re only a few inches long. ”   “ I guess ... But… What if it ’ s a piece of glass , right ? ”   “ No , it ’ s not glass at all . Look , I ’ m going to put it down . I ’ m going to keep it out of the telescope. ”   “ Will you do that ? ” The blonde scientist nodded .   “ I ’ ll go to my car . I ’ ll check it out later . I ’ ll try to tell anyone . But ... Just go get your coat . Just be sure to get your car ! ” The blonde scientist turned back to her colleagues and shook her head . “ I love you all ! I ’ ll come over on time and get you checked out. ”  
`` Tell me about the future , son . '' Steven smiled at my old man . His eyes looked a bit sad , but he was n't completely stupid .   `` Well , it was pretty boring . '' I said , folding my legs and stretching . `` What 's your name ? ''   Steven looked up . `` I 'm Steven . I 'm a sales manager . ''   I smiled . `` What ? What is it ? ''   Steven laughed . `` Well , I used to sleep early at night . I 'd wake up at night , but only awake , and then I would look around and then I 'd go to sleep completely . ''   `` Oh , so I could nap without being told about it ? '' I asked .   Steven smiled . `` I do n't think so . '' He pointed to a little dot in the sky . `` There was a man who woke up with a dream that would make him sleepy , but it was n't real . He could n't see the ceiling , and he did n't walk around the perimeter . ''   `` Really ? '' I asked .   `` I do n't think so . '' Steven replied .   `` What about- ''   `` He went to bed at night , and he dreamed that was n't real . '' I pointed to a little dot in the sky . `` Then he started to wake up at first , and then started running away from his dream , only to see the house change forever . ''   Steven smiled . `` When you got rid of the dream , it turned into a nightmare . The man would be sleeping in his dream , and he would wake up in a new place . ''   I nodded . `` So I woke up and got rid of his dream , then went to sleep and woke up with a nightmare again . ''   Steven nodded . `` This one helped . '' He moved his hands up to his face . `` This time , he was an older version of himself , but now was different . Soon , he was an entire world . ''   I looked at him . `` Oh , okay . '' I smiled .   Steven chuckled , and I leaned back in my chair . `` I guess you should have realized the consequences of this change . ''   `` What ? '' I asked .   Steven smiled . `` When you got rid of the dream , you realized that you were not alone , and that you would be trapped forever in a new world . '' 
`` My car 's gone ? ''  The man on the other side of the table pointed a finger at the table . An empty bottle of Jack , just another empty bottle of Jack . `` It would n't be the nicest bottle in the world , '' he replied . He reached for another glass . The door opened as he pulled it open .    `` What are you doing here ? '' the man asked , as the man sat down in the chair opposite the table .    `` I 'm making a lot of money , '' the man replied .    `` I figured it would be easy to make people do it . ''    `` I 'm making it easy for them to do it . ''    `` All the money and all the fame and power , '' the man finally said .    `` But you 're lying to me ... you 're lying to me . ''    `` It 's not . ''    `` No . It 's not . ''    `` It 's not true . ''    `` Exactly , '' the man said . He turned and walked away .    Inside , the man turned a dial . His earplugs were plugged into a small speaker attached to his phone . He heard a low , shrill , voice say , `` Please let me go . ''    He handed over the phone on the table . The speaker opened to reveal the words :  `` If you use that bottle , I 'll be rich . ''
`` Well , my question is ... If the universe exists ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Then what happens to the universe that creates all that ? ''   `` Well , for starters , we can create the universe , at every moment . ''   `` That is correct , I understand , '' said the man sitting across from us , `` but from what ? ''   `` Your answer is , is there anything else that could save us from ourselves ? ''   `` Well , no human life will survive another few millenia , '' the man said , `` there is nothing to help us . ''   `` There is ? '' said the woman , `` there is more than enough time to save us all , and then it would be futile ? ''   `` No , there are too many things up there , '' he said , `` and more than enough time to save us all , and if a planet dies , what will it do ? ''   `` Nothing , '' she said , `` I 'm sorry ... ''   `` I am , '' he said , `` and I will love you for it . ''   `` Yes , that is precisely what I am about , '' said the woman suddenly , `` but perhaps that is not true . ''   `` Yes , it is true , '' said the man , `` but I see that you are not human . ''   `` I am human , '' she said , `` and I will love you for it . ''   `` So you are not human ? ''   `` Yes , that is correct . ''   `` Then what happens to our universe that creates all that ? ''   `` Well , for starters , we can create the universe . ''
`` Do n't worry , '' said the doctor . `` Just get it over with . ''   She stepped out of the observation room and walked lightly towards the computer terminal . The technician worked furiously through the data she had just skimmed .   `` What 's the problem ? ''   The doctor took the mouse to the keyboard and typed on a terminal .   `` The computer still thinks that it 's safe to go . ''   `` You 've been doing it for what feels like the past month , have n't you ? I do n't know what to say , but I 'm not going to kill you . ''   The technician shut the computer and walked over to the console .   `` Okay , I 'm going to ask for volunteers . ''   Edit : Changed the last part of the sentence
I still remember the first time my eyes widened . It was n't every day you get that feeling you ca n't escape from a room with naught but hate and a broken heart . The moment we got to the door .   I can see her . She 's old enough to be used to it - how it used to be . She walks past the kids eating lunch in that alley way , never looking back . She 's just enjoying the sunlight filtering in . The smell of the air on it . The familiar scent of her perfume as it passes the kitchen table . The smell of her laughter when she calls me back .   And with that , I know I loved her .   She was my daughter , and I was always there with her . I never thought she would cry , but I found comfort in her . Sometimes , she 'd run in and tell me , `` Do n't go out . '' I would just stare and hope for something different , something to be made up out of the chaos . I loved her , but I had to keep moving forward , to keep up with her .   And I loved her .   See , when you get hit by a car that smashed into your head , you 're going to figure it out . And when you 're in a hospital bed , you 're going to figure it out . And when you 're in a hospital bed , you 're actually going to figure it out .   And I loved her .
Day 2   I sat down on my bed in my old bedroom , staring at a screen on the far wall that reads `` Update 100 '' . That is , until I noticed a new button installed on the wall . A small red light flashed on the screen to indicate my trial had begun .   `` Congratulations , defendant . Now , you have been sentenced to life sentence . You will have a choice : spend the rest of your life in the eternal prison for crime you committed against humanity in their honor . ''   `` What if I told someone to stop me ? '' I said .   `` You wo n't regret it . Let 's just say that this trial is about to begin . If anyone ever finds out about your death , any person who knows about it will be sentenced to life in prison . If anyone will find out about your life , any person who has even discovered it will be sentenced to hell . If anyone else find out about your death , any person who has even discovered it will be sentenced to life in prison . If someone ever finds out about your life , any person who has even discovered it will be sentenced to hell . ''   It was at this point that I stopped thinking about my death . If I told someone to change their fate , any person who has ever discovered it will be sentenced to death in prison . But no , I no longer believed in my destiny . I thought about my wife , my beautiful daughter , and my dying daughter . I thought about what would happen to them if I told someone to change their fate , anything I could think of . I thought about my family 's death . I thought about how I am now in hell . I thought about how I had to die . I thought about being torn apart by the force of nature . I thought about what I saw on the other side of the world that I could not do anything about . I thinking about the death itself . I thought about my friends and family , my friends , and my children . I thought about how I had to die . I thought about how I had to die . My life was meaningless . My death was pointless . My life was pointless . Suddenly I heard a loud bang in the distance . It was coming from outside , closer for what I knew was my time .   `` Hello , hello there , Jacob . Welcome back . ''   I felt a strange feel in my chest . I wanted to scream , but I knew that I could not scream . I thought about my children . I considered what I had seen . I thought about what would happen to them if I told them . I thought about my wife 's death . I thought about what I saw on the other side of the world that I could not do anything about , and then there was the bang .   A large man with a bald head appeared behind me . He looked down at me , and said `` Welcome back , Jacob . Welcome back . ''   I was confused , but I could feel something in my chest . I tried to ask what was going on , but I could not .   `` Jacob , what happened ? '' he said .   I looked up from my desk to look at the man . He was bald , but not as bald as I originally thought . I could feel my heart pounding in my chest .   `` Jacob , are you alright ? '' he asked .   I looked at him curiously , and he said `` Yes , I 'm fine . But why are you here ? ''   `` We need to take you to your next trial . What happens now after the trial is over ? ''   I looked at him for a moment , then at my current situation . I was sitting on my couch in my old bedroom . I was in a plane ticket that would take flight to China . My wife was nowhere to be found .   `` Jacob , what happens now after the trial is over ? '' he repeated .   I looked at him again . He was bald , but not as bald as I originally thought . I was in a plane ticket that would take flight to China . My wife was nowhere to be found .   `` We need to take you to your next trial . What happens now after the trial is over ? '' he repeated .   I looked at him for a moment , then at my current situation . I was in a plane ticket that would take flight to China . My wife and I had been forced to go to China . In a plane ticket that had passed by Canada , we lost our old woman and our beautiful daughter . Our wonderful daughter had passed away . My wife and I had been forced to go to China .   `` We need to take you to your
It had been months since my family had moved into the city I was currently living in . They were all parents , I had no siblings or close friends that I could speak to . I couldn ’ t remember much past four . I had moved to the city so the only memory I had was trying to make friends and talking to people in a dark room that was filled with shadows . I did not recall coming home , nor going in the house , but as I struggled with the dark thoughts about where my family was , I lost myself . Years passed by , and I couldn ’ t remember driving home . Where was I ? I struggled with the questions that my brain was trying to come up with . I needed to find a way to get rid of the darkness . No point in wasting my time . I got onto the bus and took my keys . I had a couple of extra hours before they started to run out of gas . I climbed out of the bus and kept quiet . I didn ’ t know what to do . People ran past me . Most were scared and ran away . I sat on the bus , and talked to people . The fear had worn off soon enough . I had become so filled with hope that I had been forgotten . I took a deep breath and prayed I could say something before speaking .   “ I ’ m only in one minute before the end of the world . I can ’ t take it anymore. ”
`` I need your help , I need nothin ' ! '' I cried , and I tried to shout at him , but got instead held onto his hand .   His eyes drifted from me to the door . `` Please do n't leave me alone ! '' he demanded .   I tried to get away , but he held me back . `` Your loss wo n't help you , '' but I held him back . `` Please , call an ambulance . For my money , '' I pleaded .   He gave me a look . `` I 'll call an ambulance , '' he said , his voice choked on emotion . `` For my money , '' he said again .   `` Please , '' I pleaded with him , `` I need to be on my way . Please , '' I pleaded with him .   He gave me another look . `` I ... I need to talk . ''   I opened my mouth , but he was already there . `` Please , '' I asked .   `` I ca n't stay in here , '' he whispered , and I heard the crash of metal . My head cocked back in surprise .   He was gone , and I was left alone .  
It started out slow enough , I mean , yeah…just a few hours .   As it slowly got more and more intense , my eyes flutter open . The surroundings seem to be more vivid…and as I see the smoke clears , I can hear the sirens . They were getting closer…I guess they were just behind me .   It was at that moment that I realize what my life was like before I started…well , really , at that moment…I guess I was…*the* Devil .   The last thing I remember was a cold sweat rolling down my back . The sirens were everywhere , I could practically see a man ’ s face in the distance , almost transparent .   “ You ’ re finally free . You can see where it all started , ” I heard a voice whisper . It wasn ’ t the Devil itself , but the voice had told me that it was not going to be long .   My head lifted a little . I hadn ’ t been drinking since I died , I mean , I didn ’ t drink at all . I was getting used to it .   “ What ’ s happening ? ” I asked , trying to remember if I was seeing things or not . It didn ’ t really seem like I bothered , but it wasn ’ t until I moved my legs out of bed that I realized I was in Heaven , in a room filled with hundreds of creatures that were completely naked and in various states of decay . I wondered what I really was though .   “ You ’ re finally free , ” a tiny voice answered .   “ Huh ? ” I asked , confused .   “ Well…if you have any questions , let ’ s go to the Garden of Eden ” the voice said , as I walked into a corridor , “ and let ’ s start by explaining…well… ” it started , “ there are an infinite number of bugs , each one with hundreds of little insects , and there are two very special insect species called ‘ the scorpions ’ . Whenever the scorpion gets close to the one you ’ re supposed to kill , they are basically sentience , killing and exterminating the scorpions , until they find you and kill you . This creature has numerous names , ranging from scorpions to scorpions . It ’ s number is 1,000,000,000,000 , and it can never be killed again. ”   I stared at the creature . There was a loud scraping coming from behind me , and I turned around as it hit me .   “ What the fuck is this ? ” I asked as I looked at the creature , “ are you fucking kidding me ? ”   “ No , no no , you ’ re not , ” the creature said . It had a look in its eyes that screamed , “ for you ’ re death , ” and this looked like a bullet .   “ Is this some kind of joke ? ” I asked again , and this time I was standing in a huge room with dozens of colorful insects , all crawling in every conceivable direction , staring at me from afar .   “ Well , ” the creature started , “ you see , ” it took a deep breath , “ one day , a sentient scorpion approached us , asking us to kill each other . And then they wanted to kill you , so they decided to kill you. ”   “ Why are you telling me that ? ” I asked , confused .   “ Because we were fighting for you , ” the creature said , “ at least a thousand times . And we ’ ve had hundreds of thousands of scorpions. ”   “ Oh… okay… ”   “ And when it finally got close to you , it started to eat the scorpions , and eat the other scorpions , because it was so fucking hungry . And then it ate all of you at once . It took all four of us to control all of the insects . The entire planet is now covered in bugs , and we are all eating at once . However , one day , the scorpion started asking us to kill him again . And then , the scorpion told us to start to eat him . And now they have no choice but to kill him again. ”   “ Hmm… ” I started to get scared .   “ Tell me , why did you use this job ? ” the creature said .   “ Because
`` What do you mean the best thing ever ? ''   `` Well , I mean ... ''   `` Are you saying we can kill you ? ''   `` No , at least not tonight . ''   `` Well I 'm sure your whole life has been a bit stressful lately . ''   `` How so ? ''   `` Well , i mean the recent events have been bad , you know . ''   `` What is your opinion on killing me ? ''   `` Well , I mean , the first few times I tried , nothing happened . It was just the usual stuff . Even the news anchor 's on the other side . He 's even been trying to save me . ''   `` Are you saying you 're going back to life in a shitty place like this ? ''   `` They 've been trying *everything* in the last 20 years . I ca n't even tell because they wo n't even tell what I know about what I 'm not going to tell them . For being such a loser , I figured that they 'd love that . ''   `` Maybe you 'll forgive me if I 'm late . ''   `` Goodnight Mr. President . ''   `` Good night you too . ''   `` What do you mean the best thing ever ? ''   `` Well , i mean ... I mean the world is going to end someday , but not this way . It 's going to end in a giant death by an asteroid or something , because the Earth wo n't even be breathing . Not even this way . ''   `` I do n't think you would forgive me . ''   `` I 'm so sorry , I 've been so afraid of dying . But in a way that 's true . You 're so much better than that . ''   `` Well , it 's kind of funny to me . ''   `` I mean ... I do n't really think you would forgive me . ''   `` I know about your opinions on it . ''   `` I do n't believe you do . ''   `` Oh , I do n't even know you did . ''   `` Well , it 's all over now . All my friends and family are gone . ''   `` This has been going on for eternity . Everyone I ever cared about has been gone . ''   `` No , I ... ''   `` It 's all over now . ''   `` Hey , I 'm sorry . ''
You think you can destroy me when others are so afraid of you ? No !   You were right . You have no right to destroy me . You will destroy everything from me , that is all you have ever wanted , is enough .   You are so wrong about me .   I am the only thing that can stop you . I am the only one that can stop you from leaving . I am THE ONLY ONE who can save you . I am the one that can stop you from hurting me .   No .   No .   No .   No .   No .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   NO .   No .   NO .   NO .   No .   NO .
You did n't believe me , or understand , or think I did you were you , just another man lying silently in his own filth , surrounded by his enemies . No matter how hard you tried , you always ended up working late , and the best thing about me was I could n't even get home . I was just a general .   When he came in from a particularly cold , dark , and distant world , he was an alien and had to speak to the representatives of Earth after making a speech . `` The Gods will not allow you to enter , '' I told him .   He laughed nervously and then seemed to start talking again , slowly . `` They want to kill us in a fit of rage , '' he eventually said . I figured he has started to understand what I was going through .   `` This is the best course of action , '' as he started to speak he began to shake violently . I thought we were having a mental breakdown , and I was terrified , but I continued . `` Let us try again and again . ''   He started to pull his sword out of his sleeve . `` Then you will be found guilty by the council of Galactic Council , '' he began .   As my mind began to race , I realized I did n't understand what he was talking about . I grabbed my thoughts , tried to understand what I had made him do , and I suddenly began to realize he had gotten away .   I ran over , ran up to his body , and pulled him out . He collapsed to the ground , exhausted , and just breathing . `` I told you , '' I said , `` I must tell you your story , and the way I saw it , that you will be punished . ''   He had stared at me , and I knew what could be done . He started to speak again , and this time he was only slightly more hesitant . I did my best to keep him quiet , but I knew I could n't let him continue . `` This is the best course of action , '' he muttered .   I saw him start to feel as if he should be crying , and then he was gone . I could feel his tears flowing freely all around him , but I had no choice but to comfort him .   If he was finally dead , then how many world leaders would come to my aid , if only I could give him a better explanation . The only solution that would solve this crisis would be to leave him alone in his filth for a few moments , before I could contact him .
`` At least they 'd be safe now , '' said the President , sitting down in his luxurious armchair , the silver tie hung loosely around his neck .   He set the dinner down in front of him as the television mounted on his lap flipped to the side .   `` Good evening to both of you fellow Americans , today is September 21st , 2021 . We are not sure what you expected , but we are not prepared to answer . ''   The President stared at the television for a moment , his face contorted in disappointment , before looking up at the sky .   `` ... ''   `` Why have you chosen a less prosperous country , with less economic growth ? ''   The President 's brow furrowed , as he waited for the answer .   `` Because we are not prepared for the prospect of losing our freedom , '' he continued , `` as you know . We are not prepared for the prospect of losing our freedom . We are not ready to accept that we have lost our freedom , and so you are not ready to abandon our freedom . ''   The President sat silent for a moment , listening for the response . He was quiet until the end of the spectrum , when one of the aides reached out and reached into the blackberry bag of coffee he wore .   `` Please , take a seat . I 'm not going to start thinking about that . ''   The President sat . He felt free . He felt free . He was free . The first official words he had heard since the US military kicked in after World War II were , `` And you are here . Do you want to know what happens ? ''   The aide stepped forward and grabbed the President 's arm . It was rough and cold , and the President felt the cold touch of a hand on his shoulder .   `` Do you want me to give you some advice ? ''   The President was startled , and the aide withdrew it from him . He watched as the President felt a gentle warmth spreading warmth across his skin .   `` I could give you a lot- ''   `` No , you could n't , '' interrupted the aide , `` you ca n't ! ''   The President looked around , his eyes meeting the aide 's in a state of shock .   `` Oh , '' he began , `` How can I even begin to explain to you that this is n't real ? ''   The aide laughed , a light chuckle that seemed to echo for miles across the country .   `` I 'm sorry , '' the President said , `` But we 're not ready to abandon our freedom . We are not ready to accept that we have lost our freedom . ''   The aide took a sip from the coffee in front of him , and let out a sigh .   `` I am sorry , '' he said , `` But it 's not going out there . ''   The President contemplated this for a moment . He got up to leave , but his hand lingered on the President 's arm .   `` I have to go . ''   The President looked back up at the sky , and turned back to the TV .   `` Is this really it ? ''   The aide , who had slipped the remote switch , shook his head . He turned back around , and saw the Oval Office , just sitting in the corner of the room .   The President looked back at the TV again , and waited for the answer to come .   `` ... What happened to Mexicans , they were n't supposed to be here ? ''
`` What is happening ? '' I screamed at myself . My family would n't listen . `` Why do you think that ? '' I mustered up the courage to ask my wife . `` We do n't need human names anymore . We did n't need to know . We did n't need to know . ''   My wife gave a slight tremble as she looked at me with a smile . She was right . I could n't see anything . My entire body was shaking . A tear streamed down my face . `` Please understand why we 're doing this . '' I pleaded . `` We 're not supposed to do this . We 're supposed to be saving our family . ''   Her lips parted as she turned away from me . `` Who are you ? '' I asked .   `` My name 's Emma . ''   `` A daughter ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Go back . '' We just stood there , completely dumbfounded . `` What if my wife comes home or something . ''   `` Emma . ''   `` What if I 'm the woman of the earth ? ''   `` Emma , do n't be silly . You 're the one who saved our family . ''   I was still confused , but still furious at myself . I thought for a moment . I remember my kids crying when I told them I was a woman . They would n't believe me . I could n't believe that I was the one who saved their entire family .   `` Emma . ''   `` Go back . ''   `` Go back into that night . ''   `` Why would you do that ? ''   `` I loved you . ''   `` But why now ? ''   `` I loved you . ''   I could n't believe it . How could I miss the one who saved their entire family ?   `` Emma , Emma , do n't be silly . Nobody loves you . Your sweet baby loves you . ''   `` What ? ? ''   `` She loves you too . ''
My name is Jack , and you may ask , How do we get out of here ? I 'm a gazelle .   I met a girl . A beautiful girl . It was a party . She was going to get drunk and blow her nose .   Just like that , she was back in her party and drinking . I talked to her . She did n't say anything , just did n't seem to care . Then , she called me up .   `` Hello ? ''   I answered . I did n't know what she meant , but I knew who she was . It was great ! I realized that when I asked what she was doing , she did n't answer . Instead , she just stared at me the whole time .   With that , she disappeared . I did n't believe her . So I stayed out of that party . I stayed home . I kept reminding myself that I did n't have any friends , and that I was n't here to make it in time .   In the next few weeks , I made my way out of that party . I was living in a small town of about two hundred people . It was nice , cool , almost peaceful . I stayed in the local tavern , and drank until I found my way into the town . I drank until the group of people decided to start drinking .   I woke up to people . They were all wearing masks , and the people in them looked very different . They looked like me ! I thought it might be odd . They had odd faces , and odd gestures ! But when I started to get suspicious , I started to smell weird.I do n't know how long I spent waiting for them to show up .   The whole town was pretty confused , and I just decided to go find someone to help .   They showed up .   They were weird things . Their hands were all glowing . They looked like me , and their eyes were so round and blue . They were all wearing sunglasses , and their hands were tiny black dots . They were covered in scales .   Then they started talking . They said , `` Are we humans ? We are humans . ''   The entire townspeople started getting mad ! They shouted , `` Where are we ? What are you talking about ? You 're not really human ! Where are we ? ''   The humans kept saying , `` You 're the devil ! '' But they did n't understand . And they did n't even want to know .   I kept following them . I kept in the town . I knew they were coming . I knew they were n't going from the world I created . I knew they were n't going to give up their life , and that they were going to die here .   I kept following them . I kept following . Every day , I would follow them back , until they were gone .   Then one day , they would come . And I would follow them . Together . Until they were dead .   I stayed out of the town , and listened to their shouts . I stayed in the town , and drank every so often . The townspeople were still scared and afraid of death , and so , I kept drinking . It was n't long before they were talking again .   They were talking about me . I was coming . And it was over .   I stayed behind . I watched them talk to another one of the humans . He looked confused .   The humans spoke again , `` are we humans ? We are humans ! Where are we ? How are we alive ? ''   The woman in the hat spoke up , `` We are from earth . We are here to help you out . We are a part of your kind . ''   I thought for a minute . How long was it until they disappeared ? They were so far away , they could n't be real . What 's happening to us ?   I finally calmed down .   I took a long drink of my drink . I tasted something different , and it was delicious .   What does that smell like ?
She stumbled a bit off the toilet and rolled over . The cold steel of her side buckled beneath her . She bit her lip and took a deep breath , taking deep breaths . The room was dark and deserted .   `` Where are you ? ! '' She shouted . Her voice cracked and her eyes widened . Her legs felt like they were going to give out . At first she thought it was a kind of dream , but then she saw the cold metal of the toilet in her hand .   There was a single word in the metal . *Deceiver of the Human Race* . She tried to hold it in as long as she could , but it stuck in her teeth . With a jeal of relief she made her way towards the toilet .   The thought made her even more nervous . This was the most important moment in her life . She had all the friends she could , and the last of her family . The toilet ran out of power , and she could n't move . She made her way to the bathroom , and faced the cold steel of the toilet .   She raised her hands , and reached out to touch the handle . It creaked and her hand caught on and something stuck out . It was the object she had dreamed of , a key she had been holding since she was seven years old . The key had been a pair of goggles with a bright yellow light in the middle . She could see the key clearly .   `` There 's a key , '' she told the Key . She was shaking and she could n't move . She pushed the key back into its holder . She squeezed harder , and the key popped open . Her fingers hurt .   `` Open it , '' she whispered into the key .   `` Wait , '' she heard a female voice behind her . `` It 's open . '' She turned around . The voice was a woman in her thirties . She wore a black labcoat with black and red buttons . She was n't a doctor . It was her mother .   `` Oh , hello , '' she said , reaching out . Her hands were shaking now .   `` Hello , '' she whispered in the key . She pushed forward and the key opened .   The woman was breathing rapidly . Her eyes widened . Her body shook , and she realized she had n't moved much . She shook her head violently . She pulled out the knife and pointed it at the woman 's throat . Her thumb hit the knife , and the blood drained from her . She tried to scream , but her throat was dry and her throat was raw . A part of her had swallowed her whole heart .   `` What ? What happened ? ! '' She yelled into the key . The woman was breathing heavily now . The woman started sobbing harder , and her eyes softened .   `` Please , just let go , '' she said . She opened the door and stared at the woman in front of her . The woman was crying harder now , but she was smiling . So was she . `` Please , just let go ! '' She pleaded . Her eyes darted to the door , which was completely shut and there was nothing in the other room except for her bare feet and a bed with a white blanket .   `` I ... I 'm so sorry , '' she whispered into the key . Her eyes widened as she realized she had only been holding the key in her hand .   The man in the labcoat looked at her . He stared back at her , then back around the room . `` I 'm so sorry , '' he said solemnly . The woman , who had been crying , stared at him , then at the floor . The woman stared back at her . She looked back at the man in the labcoat . He was trembling now , and he looked at the woman in front of him . He stared back at her . He stared back at her .   `` Please , just let go , '' he yelled . `` Please , just let go ! ''   There was a brief struggle as the woman in the labcoat and the man in the lab coat looked at them . He looked at the floor . He looked at the woman in the labcoat . She looked at him . She stared into his eyes .   `` Please do n't , '' he pleaded . The woman looked at him . Her eyes widened , and she sobbed harder . The man in the labcoat looked at her again . He looked at her . He looked at her . She screamed internally , but she was still smiling . She had finally started to cry again . The two of them stared at each other as they laid there trembling , and it hurts to cry .   `` Please , please , just
They came from nowhere .   They came from everywhere and nowhere at once . From the same house , I never did remember it , or that it was there , but I know for sure , it came down from above . Once on this floor , they came into view , and they looked pleased . To them , it made my blood boil . To myself , it scared me .   They came with a purpose .   They were great . Bigger than the humans . They stood taller than any other creature , and they built better than any other being . They built more than anything , but if they chose to build bigger than anything , they got smarter .   But if they chose to build greater , they stopped the production of more .   So they built itself .   I do n't know what they took from me . I do n't know what they did with everything else they took . I do n't know how long they fell . Or what they destroyed . But I know that nothing will change .   I know that they have much more to do .   I 'm afraid . 
`` You will kill me . ''   `` I will kill you . Can you repeat that ? ''   `` I do n't know . I thought you could do that . ''   `` You will shoot me in the chest . How did you even know about this ? ''   `` You will kill me in a car . The same way you killed a dog . It 's always running away . ''   `` Excuse me , but how did you even know about my dog ? ''   `` Everything about your dog is the same . He ca n't run . He does n't eat . No matter how many times I try to eat him , he does n't stop starving . ''   `` You do n't understand , '' I said .   `` I understand . But he ca n't run , no matter how hard I try to eat him , he does n't stop fighting anymore . I 'm trying to kill him in a car . ''   `` That 's not true . ''   `` What about the dog ? How does everything hurt ? How does he live like that ? ''   `` I 've always wanted him to die . That 's why I went in here , to save him once and for all . ''   `` And why did you come in here ? ''   `` Because I had the job . ''   `` But ... ''   `` Because you already killed him . ''   `` I -- ''   `` You spent your whole life here . I spent it hunting him , chasing his prey , I waited until I could feel his pain , and now I know . I know everything about him . He does n't eat . He does n't sleep . I do n't think anyone else knows . ''   `` And how was I ever supposed to know ? ''   `` Because I knew him . And I know that I was a good person . But I had to kill him . And I 'm only trying to save you , so I can be as good as you . ''   I hesitated .   `` You know what ? ''   `` There 's no need to leave him here . You and I both know that he needs to go , that he needs to stay here . ''   `` What if the animals come for him ? ''   `` No . ''
`` So you 're saying you 're going to give her a boy ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Are you sure ? Is she yours ? ''   `` If so . ''   `` Alright then . ''   `` Okay then . ''   `` One day . ''   `` Two . ''   `` Three . ''   `` Four . ''   `` And so on . ''   `` Five . ''   `` Six . ''   `` Nine . ''   `` Ten . ''   `` Eight . ''   `` Nine . ''   `` Eight . ''   `` Nine . ''   `` Nine . ''   `` Ten .

''   `` Forty six . ''   `` Thirty seven . ''   `` Forty eight . ''   `` Forty eight . ''   `` Forty nine . ''   `` Forty eight . ''   `` We 're not giving you a boy . ''   `` I 'm not . ''   `` You are . ''   `` I 'll be . ''   `` And that is why we need to make sure that you are having a boy . ''   `` We do n't . ''   `` That . ''   `` That is what we need to do . ''   `` That is what we need to do . ''   `` That is what I need to do . ''   `` That is what we need to do . ''   `` That is what we need to do . ''   `` That is what we need to do .

''   `` That is what I am giving you , and that is what we can not do . ''   `` That is what I am giving you , and that is what we can not do . ''   `` That is what I am giving you , and that is what we can not do . ''   `` That is what I am giving you , and that is what I am giving you to do . ''   `` That is what I am giving you to do . ''   `` That is
Her favorite place to sit was across from the sun , sitting on the sand , staring off into the distance , watching the waves splash away on the horizon . The water is still warm in her room , and her favorite color is the color of green . She sees nothing further out above her , no sign of civilization , just the ocean .   It ’ s amazing how real life is here , without the clouds and the heat . A life without the sun , without the heat , without the wind or the sun .   The last time her father looked to her , once he saw her gaze , he had said to her , “ *There is no rain . * ” Her father thought it best to give her a better life , since she was only fourteen ! The first time she saw him , her father was very proud of her , but also very sad . His tears took on this sadness every day , and it made him sad , even when she was young . Her mother was a strong woman , but she was also sad . She believed she was destined to be like her father , because she knew how awful she would be if she didn ’ t do something to change her ways !   On account of how she hated the ocean , her father came here , saying , “ *I hope this lasts , and we can leave this blue planet forever* . ” When she saw him leave , she could see nothing more than the ocean .   As she sat here , contemplating her new life , her thoughts were interrupted by a noise , and she turned to see the source . It was a small boat , with a huge engine on the side , and a bright red hooded man .   “ *I 'm sorry , child , but I could not allow a child such as you to live in this heat . I am warning you , that your mother , or at least you can see her , has been gone . * ” He said , and turned his head , turning his gaze downwards . “ *Come now , child , I can show you how much I loved you . * ” He turned towards her , and sighed . They had both long since moved closer , but she was feeling truly happy .   The boat continued on on , and she noticed a man in the distance . He wore a pair of blue gloves , and wore plain white to cover his face , and she wondered what this man would look like if he came back here , so she decided , “ *You know , I 'll be back for a while . * ” She turned to see him , and said , “ *There is no rain . * ” She stood up quickly , and yelled , “ *There is only rain , and the birds will sing it . * ” She turned to the sun , and saw him staring off into the distance , and she understood , “ *There is no rain . * ” She turned back towards the shore , and thought , “ *There is only rain. ”  
At around midnight the fog crept in over the city , rolling away like a shroud of darkness . The sky would seem dark and silent as the thick veil of fog slowly descended upon the city . All was quiet , save for her father and grandfather , who huddled together in their comfortable leather seats . The man in particular was frail , tired , and as usual , the older one was waiting patiently in his seat .   `` Alright , Dad . Just a few more hours and we 'll all go back to sleep . '' The younger one replied , rubbing his eyes and waving his arms around . `` Tell me , what 's going on here ? '' Just then another figure came up from the doorway , wielding a long knife .   `` I really do n't know , Dad . I just do n't know . It had to have been a dream , or something . '' He said , crossing his arms . `` We could 've sworn I heard them last night . In the distance I saw a glowing orb coming toward us . It was approaching us , and everything went dark . '' Their father 's voice trembled . `` What did you see ? '' He said , pulling the blade from his hands . `` Nothing , but for a brief moment . Then everything changed . ''   `` What 's happening ? '' The older one asked , suddenly worried . `` Do you see him ? Do you hear him ? '' He looked up into the cloudy sky .   `` I do n't know . It ca n't be , Dad . It ca n't be . '' The younger soldier looked back at his father , who stood frozen , eyes blank . `` That 's what the orb really meant , '' he replied , shaking his head . `` It could 've been a dream , or a hallucination . I would n't be able to tell you . '' The older soldier 's eyes widened . `` No , Dad . I do n't know . I know that it 's a dream . But everything is so dark . Just a brief moment . ''   `` But you ca n't go far ! There 's somewhere out there ! '' The younger soldier said , pulling the knife from its sheath . `` You ca n't go anywhere ! '' He yelled , struggling to stand up as the younger soldier grabbed his father 's arm and dragged him into the nearby streets .   `` Dad ! '' The older soldier yelled , reaching into his pocket and pulling out a bright crimson envelope and a black leather book . `` Here ! '' He said and threw it at the younger soldier .   `` Dad ! '' The younger soldier yelled , his hands writhing in agony . `` Dad ! '' The older soldier yelled , the tears welling up behind his eyes . `` Dad ! ! '' The younger soldier cried , his vision fading to black .
Do n't forget to keep the lights on . For those not prepared , do n't turn the corner .   The light was n't there on September 11 , 1993 . It was n't there in my apartment , or in my house . Everyone was there . Everyone felt alive . Everyone .   I was just there , at church . I was just checking my messages . It was my brother 's birthday . We were both celebrating with joy . There were Christmas Carols around the room . I had to make sure to close my eyes . I had to make sure the light was still on .   The light was n't there on September 11 , 1993 .

The lights took us over Europe , but we managed to catch up to the people in Japan . They were everywhere , and there was a burning building in the distance . They were n't coming for us . We never did .   I was just here there , watching them . watching them soar over our heads . I was just here . Watching the planes . Watch them fly .   The lights took us over the Middle East , where people were dying . Many died , but hundreds still lived .   I was just here , watching them . Watching them fly . Watching them fly .

She was there , with me . After so much years of watching her leave , a tear slipped down her cheek .   I stood and started walking down the hallway . I was surprised when , when a man came in .   `` We 're almost there , miss . '' I said .   `` Why do n't you just go now , '' said the man in a suit .   `` You 're not going to believe what you 're seeing . '' I said .   `` Have fun , and please follow me , '' he said .   And we followed .   When I arrived at the end of the hall , I saw her on the living room floor , smoking smoke from a cigarette in her hand .   `` You look ... a little shocked , are n't you ? '' she asked .   `` Yes , '' I answered . `` What is this about ? ''   `` We 're almost there , miss . ''
The killer stood , two guards on either side . The killer held his chin in shame .   `` Please , '' The guard said . `` I do not want any of this . I do not want your suffering . '' He lowered his chin again and put his hands on the table , his eyes meeting mine . `` I need to tell you something . ''   `` Your suffering , '' I said , `` is terrible , and I fear , '' I smiled at him .   `` Yes , '' he said , `` and I fear you will never understand . I fear your suffering . ''   `` How ? How can you be so bad ? '' I said . `` You are a monster . You are cursed . You will never understand . ''   `` I will never understand , '' he said .   `` I will never understand , '' I said . `` You are cursed . You are wretched . ''   `` Please , do not cry . ''   `` I have the burden of killing you . This is not the way . ''   `` I understand , '' I said , `` but you can not understand me . Please , I do not want my suffering . I need to tell you something . ''   There was a long pause .   `` You will never understand , '' I said , `` but you will never understand . ''   `` Do not cry , '' I said , `` although I hope you will understand , '' I smiled with a smile . `` I will never understand you . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` Why did I give you this job ? ''   `` Because God did not allow it . ''   `` Why would he ? ''   `` Because God created me . ''
`` WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHhh ! '' I screamed as I fell to the floor with a broken jaw . Standing in the middle of the street , looking like I was about to pull a knife out of my chest , I noticed the blood on my shirt . `` Ow ! Ow ! ! '' I yelled again .   `` WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHWAAAAHHHHHHHH ! ! ! ''   I stood up and began to run . Nowhere near the top of the block , I saw the bodies of my fellow men hang in the air . I reached a sharp point . I was safe . Everything was going to be okay , except for the one man who stood before me .   `` I am so sorry , '' he said . `` I ca n't take this anymore . I lost my right arm . My left leg . ''   I look around to see if anyone else was still around , but there is nothing .   `` How did you ... ? '' I asked .   `` ... '' he asked in shock . His voice was cold and calm . `` I lost my right arm . And then I died , right where I am . ''   I looked at the man . His eyes were blue , and a sad smile on his face . I could make out a small , red stain on his cheek .   `` It 's OK , '' he says . `` I 'm not going to hurt you . Just please let me go . ''   `` No , '' I whispered to myself . `` No , '' I repeated . `` Please . ''   He looked at me again .   `` Please , '' he said . `` Please let me go . ''   `` It is n't ... it 's not safe . ''   He looked at me , eyes burning but somehow still laughing . `` I am going to make my way to the other side . ''   `` I am going to make my way to the other side ? '' I asked .   `` Yeah . '' He said . `` Maybe that makes things easier . ''   `` Oh ? ''   `` I will make my way to the other side of the block . ''   `` I will make my way to the other side . ''   `` No , '' I repeated . `` Just please let me go . ''   `` You ca n't hurt me , '' I told him .   He looked at me .   `` Oh , '' he replied . `` I 'm sorry . I love you . I told you ... I will make my way to the other side . ''   `` My name is Jeffery . ''   `` Jeffery ? '' I asked . `` Wait , wait ... are you ... Jeffery ? ''
`` Checkmate , '' said the woman who sat across from me . `` And you 've got a blackjack right next to your own . ''   I stared at her , unmoved . I could feel the tension building at the edges of my cheeks . `` That 's a blackjack . ''   The woman raised her hand . `` No , '' she said . `` You 've got a blackjack right next to and a blackjack right next to yours . ''   `` Well , '' I said . `` What if you ... What if ... What if ... What if you 're ... what if we ... ''   There was an awkward silence . `` You know how it works . ''   The woman 's stare grew wider . `` What if ... '' she said . `` You know why we do n't play with you anymore . You 're stuck here in this game . ''   `` Why are you ... Why are you here ? ''   `` This game is about all the things we 'll miss . All the things we 'd never be able to see with our eyes . '' She trailed off . `` Would n't you ... Would you ... Would you be better off dead ? ''   `` Oh , '' I whispered .
`` So it has been a while since he 's touched the surface . ''   `` I do n't know what you mean to say , Dr. Rahlak . It was n't an easy venture . I was in the midst of an expedition to the edge of the desert to study a new civilization . The natives , on the other side of the world , were as far away from us as I was from them . They had no idea how long they 'd been there . ''   `` We must look away , for they were n't in that place already . Your team could easily take an entire expedition by force . ''   `` Sir , we are approaching the edge . You 've taken one look at the coast , and the entire planet can clearly see the sun . ''   `` It 's absolutely beautiful , the sun is almost to the horizon , and the air is absolutely filled with a rich rich smell . ''   `` How 's the wind here , sir ? ''   `` It 's pretty good , Dr. Rahlak . ''   `` The sky is beautiful , and the water ... ''   `` Is n't that what you 're saying ? ''   `` I mean , Dr. Rahlak , they say that the Earth has a deep , deep ocean in it , capable of sustaining life . ''   `` Wait , there IS life ? ''   `` Not exactly . They 're saying that the air is absolutely clean , filled with the rich scent of it , and the water ... ''   `` What does that say ? ''   `` Well , that 's exactly what I 'm saying , sir . I 'm saying that the air is a clean , clean atmosphere . That 's exactly what I 'm saying . ''   `` You 've taken a picture of the entire planet , Dr. Rahlak . ''   `` No , sir . ''   `` So it 's nothing bad ? ''   `` No , Dr. Rahlak . Life , it 's fantastic ! What you 're saying is that everything else is absolutely beautiful ! ''   `` Oh , so it 's true , sir , that everything else is absolutely fine . ''   `` Then how long has it been since we 've touched the surface ? ''   `` I dunno ... just about a week . I was hoping that this would be one of the first in a long time they encountered a civilization . ''   `` But ... there is no civilization on the other side of the city anymore ! ''   `` There 's no civilization anywhere , Doctor . ''   `` Then this is n't a ship . It is n't a planet . It is n't a civilization . There are n't any gods and gods at all ! ''   `` It 's just that , Dr. Rahlak , this is just a big dream . You know that , right ? ''   `` I suppose so . ''   `` Then what 's that , Dr. Rahlak ? ''   `` Well , sir , we 're coming for a few days , and we need to see if there are any civilization anywhere for us to find . ''   `` But why ? ''   `` I mean , really , we have to see if there 's a civilization there . ''   `` Does that mean there 's a civilization anywhere ? ''   `` Well , no . It does n't . ''   `` Is that so ? ''   `` Well , sir , yeah . I mean , sure . But there 's no civilization anywhere else . ''   `` You mean , there are n't any tribes ?

We need to make sure everything is planned before all of this has even started . ''   The president sighs . `` Can we do anything about it ? ''   The Secretary of State looks at him expectantly . `` We need to make sure the world is safe . ''   The people of the table look at each other .   `` What ? ''   The Secretary of State looks at the Secretary of treasury . `` There 's no way we can just wipe out Russia . We wo n't stand the risk of losing that power . We have to get them to surrender . ''   The people of the table give the Secretary a confused look . `` There 's nothing we can do about it . We 're just waiting .

I stared at her , my brow furrowed .   `` So tell me again , what do you do ? ''   The man across from me , who was now my opposite , looked up from the cigarette that was perched in his mouth . `` Well , it is ... ''   I caught her eye , and she squinted .   `` How do you get scars ? ''   I leaned up on the edge of the seat , my face red . I could see her right up close , watching the cigarette drop its contents onto the floor .   `` Just , like , how do you die ? ''   `` Well , just like like I said , it is ... '' I pushed the cigarette onto the table , watching the room through my dirty glasses as they splattered spittle onto the carpet . `` Just like I said , it is ... ''   Then the man across from me interrupted again . `` Maybe you should n't have asked that . ''   I pushed back a little , my eyes following her for a moment . Then I took a deep breath , and took a single breath . The room was small , at least ten stories high , with no windows , and the only bright light coming from the small single lamp in front of the desk in front of us . I stretched , staring at the ceiling .   `` Hey , this one 's from the kitchen . ''   The man across from me nodded . `` Oh . Well ... yeah . This one 's from the bathroom . ''   He took a step towards the door , then another .   `` Hey . '' His voice was soft , but not unkind .   I pressed the pedal , and opened the door .   He was standing on the ground , looking at the floor . I quickly flipped around to head in .   I walked up to him , still gazing at the floor .   `` Is this blood ? '' he asked .   I blinked my eyes , but they slid open . I leaned against the armrest of the chair , watching the blood pool on the tile . The feeling of death took over .   `` Are you afraid of death ? ''   I nodded .   `` I 'm afraid of myself . ''   `` What ? ''   He did n't answer .   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Do you remember the first time you came here ? ''   He shook his head . `` No . ''   `` No . '' I sat down and leaned forward , staring at the floor , waiting for a response .   He looked up slowly , as though contemplating something . Then he moved his hands . `` Now , sit down . ''   I sat down and looked at him . `` What do you do ? '' I asked .   He shook his head . `` Do you know what it 's like to die ? ''   `` No . ''   My legs trembled . I looked at him , and then at the knife near his arm . I pulled the knife out of my pocket , and slipped it over my shoulder . He looked up , his eyes closed . It burned . I looked down into the blood on the tile . The back of my hand , shaking uncontrollably , got wet . I looked back up at the floor .   `` Is that ... just a scar ? ''
There was a knock at the door .   `` What gives ? ''   Hulk 's jaw fell open , slowly . It was a man wearing a costume . Tall , skinny , and sporting a large axe in one hand , a long sliver of a sword in the other . With a glint in his eye , he walked towards the door . Hulk turned behind him , and slowly walked towards the door . He was n't wearing anything except a cap , but his suit was a black leather jacket , with a helmet around his neck and a thick layer of dust on it .   `` Do n't be afraid , '' said the man . `` You 're in a bad mood . ''   `` No ! '' Hulk punched him in the face .   `` Leave me alone , I have a very important mission ahead of me , and it could 've been avoided if you had not already begun with that idea . ''   `` I know what you 're doing , '' said the man , as he removed his helmet .   `` I know what your mission is , '' said Hulk , as he got a couple of feet away from the door , and opened it . He pulled out a small metal cylinder . Inside , was what looked like a red button .   `` Well , it 's not exactly a button , but it 's a very rare button , '' said the man .   `` Oh , I 'm not sure about that , '' said Hulk , as he pressed the button .   The door opened . A young man dressed in a yellow suit stepped out .   `` Hi , I 'm Tony Stark , '' said Tony . `` I 'm the Avengers . ''   `` Tony Stark , '' said Tony . He looked around as he began to speak . `` I 'm here to bring you back to me . ''   `` What , why ? '' said Hulk , as he pressed the button .   `` Because I know what you are doing in the fight . ''   `` What ? '' asked Hulk again . `` Who are you ? ''   `` I 'm Tony Stark . ''   `` You 're a fucking lunatic ? ''   `` I am ! ''   With that , the man in the suit turned around , and walked away . Banner smiled , realizing he could just about do it himself .   He ran towards the door , and punched it again .   With a loud *crack* , and a few moments with that , it went silent .   With a sigh , he stood up . As he walked down the hall , he saw the young woman on the other side . He could n't forget the look on her face .   `` You 're ... .you 're a little rude , '' said the woman . `` You know , you should go with caution . ''   `` I 'll take care of that , '' said the man .   `` You should see the Doctor , '' said the woman . `` He looks very upset . ''   `` What 's that ? '' asked Tony as he closed the door to the Doctor 's office .   `` That you 're feeling okay ? '' asked the Doctor .   `` Oh , I ... .I feel fine , '' said the man .   `` Oh , '' said the Doctor . `` And a little more serious today , I guess ? ''   `` Oh , '' said the man . The Doctor walked back into the room , and said : `` I 'm sorry I had to do this . ''   The Doctor smiled a little , as he turned around and walked away .

The app was a simple thing , a combination of Siri 's voice and GPS coordinates that could find exactly locations on your brain to navigate your way back to where you began on your journey , and then you 'd be back on your path and back on your journey again . It seemed like a dream , but I was n't sure what to expect . I had n't had a good look at it , but I knew it was there .   It 's a feature that allows you to see all the places you chose to be , even if you did n't want to . You get your choice , and it 's all your own . The best places , these are exactly what you wanted .   **1**   I had n't made a choice yet . I had had the luxury of completing one of their many tasks . The task of getting rid of the curse of knowing the location . It 's so much easier to get rid of the curse than it would be to kill it . You 'd never have to worry about a specific fate , but you 'd probably know if you were to survive . The curse of knowing where you end up , and how long you 're going to live .   I 've been watching a lot of television lately , telling myself that I should probably use the app , but there 's not much I can do about it . My luck was picking up , and I 'd taken refuge in front of a large tree that was currently surrounded by a forest to keep a safe distance . But they were n't here yet .   **2**   They 'd called the police . They had asked me why I had n't already finished the tasks . I did n't answer , I just stared at them for a while . I do n't know what exactly happened to them , but the police did n't question me either . They just looked at me with a mixture of curiosity .   **3**   They called me back . They called me out on the way back .   **4**   They began to go on their way .   **5**   They did n't stop coming . They just kept going .   **6**   I thought maybe they would n't come any closer . Maybe they did n't even look at me .   **7**   The police had n't called .   **8**   They kept coming .   **9**   They kept coming , but they were n't sure where they were going .   **10**   They seemed to stop being there .   **11**   They stopped being there .   **12**   They did n't even disappear .   **13**   They were n't there yet .   **14**   I did n't know what to do . I could n't tell it , but it did n't change their mind .   **15**   They were n't there yet .   **16**   I did n't know what to do .
`` One of these days we 'll be all free of charge , '' the man hissed under his breath . He shook the head of the young girl sitting before him , watching her pale blue eyes cast a beam of light from his gaze and shine into the cool , brown floor . With his free hand , he held a small rectangular box containing two small trinkets . Each one held a small , white feather .   He opened the package , revealing a small gold coin . The coin was black with a white trim . The girl smiled into his hand , but the man quickly grabbed the necklace and held it precariously .   `` It 's yours , dear boy . ''   She raised her hands to her mouth , and the man smiled again .   `` Now , '' he said , and his face darkened as he held the coin towards her - noticing her hesitation .   `` You think I do n't know ? ''   The woman shook her head .   `` Do n't they see ? '' he asked , his tone somewhat distant .   She looked to him with shock , and his eyes widened .   `` You think I do n't know ? That I do n't have a choice ? ''   The man 's expression now went blank .   `` You think I do n't know ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` What does it mean ? What is it that I should wish for , anyway ? ''   `` You think you should want something . Nothing but what you want . Why should n't you want something you 've never dreamed up ? ''   The man sniffled , and as he shook his head , he said , `` We live in a world where things are n't what they should be . That 's what we 've always thought we 'd never dreamed of . ''   The girl smiled again , and from her other hand curled a small golden feather .   `` You think it 'll be like this ? ''   The man shrugged .   `` It 's not . ''   `` Who are you ? ''   `` You know we 're here . You know you never dreamed of such things . But you 're right . ''   The girl 's voice echoed in his head , and the man raised his hand and took her hand , and she began to tremble .   `` You do n't have to do this . You can do the same . But you 're going to have to do a different life . One that you 've known you 've been waiting for . One that you 've missed . One that you 've spent your entire life trying to accomplish . One that you 've always wanted , ever dreamed of . And you 've always dreamed of it . This is what it means to be free . ''   He held her hand tighter , and for a moment , there was a flash of light .   `` I regret this . ''   The man 's eyes widen .   `` It 's over . It 's happening . It 's happening to you . ''   He clenched his fist .   He looked away , barely even able to control himself . The girl was gone , and his hands were in his pockets . He slowly walked through the apartment , and out the door .   He could n't stop it , he could n't get his hands out of his pockets and move his body around . A thin layer of dust had begun to roll across the floor . There was no escape , no way to escape .   With his eyes closed , the wind began to pick up , and he felt more and more isolated , as if he were being watched .   The girl had left , and he had n't been able to make it back home .   -- -   The man stood in the shadow of an alleyway , staring at a gray , smudged form .   A tear fell down his eye .   His mouth began to tremble , and another .   He began to run . He could n't stop running . He ran until he realized he was running as fast as he could . He ran so fast every time he ran that he was almost caught up in it . He ran so fast that he felt every bone in him snap as he ran .   Eventually , the grey began to fade , and the man put his head in his hands . He began to do the
The bedsheets and sheets gave the old man some satisfaction as he slept . He had spent many years in denial , only trying to convince himself that everything could be just a dream and that even if he had been true , this would n't have been the case . The two of them had n't seen each other in years . They both knew that nothing could separate something so fragile from the other . It was something that he loved .   It was time to go home .   He closed the door quietly behind him . He knew that his mother would never return to England , that he was doomed to live on the run from the evils he still had . But for now he would leave his old ways behind .   He opened the door in his early teens . The light of the early morning made the room a dull grey , before bursting through onto the night sky . It was as though there were clouds blowing in his direction .   He walked over to a small bench , where he sat back down and began to read .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Just then , something caught his eye . It was a bear .   `` Hey man , '' the man cried .   `` What ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` Do you know how bad this is ? ''   `` Shut up ! ''   He grabbed the bear by the neck . It was n't even an animal . There was just something very different about it .   `` What are you going to do that to me ? ''   `` You know I do n't want to kill you . But please that 's the only way you can die . You have the right to be happy , because I will try to treat you perfectly . ''   `` I 'm not sure what you are saying.. ''   `` Well that was one of the better times , I 'm glad you did n't get shot . I 'll be back soon . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   He ran back over to his closet . He opened the door and found that there were bookshelves packed with books . As he walked through the hallway , he noticed that his mother had died a few days before his return .   `` I 'm so sorry ! '' he cried .   `` I just wanted to stay with you . Come and look after me while we watch my movie . ''   He put his feet back on the ground and moved to the side of the bed .   He sat down and wrapped his arms around his mother .   `` I know you 'll love me for it , but for a long time , I just do n't know when . ''   `` OK , I love you , but I must leave soon . ''   She pulled him up in her arms and kissed him .   `` Bye . ''   He followed his mother out of the room and out to the street . He could hear his mother calling him over .   `` Hey man , what the fuck is going on ? ''   `` I saw it , '' He whispered .   `` What ? ''   `` I saw it . ''   She grabbed his arms tighter .   `` No man , I ca n't leave . I 'm not even sure if I can ! I do n't have the same thing at home ! ''   She held onto his hand .   `` Why ? What the fuck are you.. ! ''   `` You do n't need to tell me . You can do what you want ! ''   `` I do n't give a damn man , I ca n't leave . ''   Her grip tightened further .   `` Stop this . ''   He grabbed the bear by the neck .   `` Do n't do this . ''   He pulled harder .   `` You are making me feel like a bad person , but I ca n't leave . ''   He pulled harder .   `` Please ... .please let me go . ''   But her grip tightened further .
`` I took a break , '' she said as she ran her finger across the knobs on her shoe . `` Did you go out on the street ? ''   I nodded . `` I really hate going out on the street , '' I muttered .   She looked down at the ground now , then up at me . `` I did n't notice you , '' she said . `` The street is empty . I need to follow the trail of the road . ''   I nodded . `` When you get married , you better follow it . You should be more careful . ''   She shrugged . `` You should be more careful ! ''   I nodded . `` I 'll do it myself . ''   She left me alone . It was almost time to get moving . I slipped into the shadow of a cab , and headed into the car . I parked and pulled up to the address I had planned to sign in . It was a warm Thursday afternoon . I passed by a newspaper stand , filled with a few other people .   The next stop was a coffee shop . The counter was sparse , but it was worth it . I entered the establishment and sat down at the metal table . It was brightly lit , but there was no one outside . I looked over at the manager . He looked like he was about to say something . Something .   `` Hi , '' he greeted at me . `` I 'm Kevin . ''   I took another sip of coffee . It was pretty damn good .   I took another sip .   `` Hey , Kevin , '' I said again . `` I noticed today was a bad day . ''   He smiled . `` It 's okay , '' he said . `` Look , I know we do n't have much time . ''   I took another sip of coffee . `` Okay , listen . I need to leave . I want to go to work . I want to sleep . There 's nothing to see . ''   He watched me for a moment . `` Okay . ''   `` Goodbye . ''   `` Bye ... And I 'll see you later , ok ? ''   He nodded .
`` Now I just have to convince you right now that you 're really screwed . That you should n't have left , that someone else could do it . ''   `` I know , I know , but I just want to tell you that I did n't do it for you . I 'm sorry , '' I stated , `` but at least you did n't have to die . Just ... just do it . ''   `` You 're going to die , '' he replied , `` it 's over now . ''   `` Shit , '' I said .   `` What ? ''   `` You can do this , '' I said .   `` You can . ''   `` I 'm sorry ? ''   `` You 're sorry . ''   `` Just tell me . ''   `` I- I just do n't understand . ''   `` You 're going to die . You 're going to die . ''   `` I..I can tell if you 're okay . Please . Tell me . ''   `` I- ''   `` You have to . Tell me . ''   `` I 'm scared . I 'll go back . I 'll go back to living in my parents ' house . I 'll go back to a normal life . I 'll go back to my parents ' house . I 'll go back to a normal life . ''   `` I- I just can't- ''   `` You 're going to die . You 're going to die . You 're going to die . ''   `` I- ''   `` Tell me . ''   `` I- ''   I screamed out , `` Tell me ! Tell me ! I 'll never kill myself ! I 'll never kill myself ! ''   `` I- I do n't know ! ! ''   `` It 's all for naught . ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   Just as I was saying this , he came back to my parents- `` My- My parents . My- My- My parents . ''   `` I- I ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` I- I 'm sorry . I- ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   Just as I was saying this , he came back to my parents- `` My- My parents . My- My- My parents . My- My parents . My parents .

**We 're not alone . **   Everyone , but my captain and I , was terrified . The entire ship was shaking .   `` Oh God , Captain , we 've only a minute . ''   `` We have yet to make contact with the Alpha Centauri planet ! They were known for their violent tendencies and propensity to murder other people . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` They all killed each other . ''   A voice came from above us .   `` What is it ? ''   `` They 're calling themselves Humans . ''   `` We 've sent some representatives to meet with them . ''   It was the voice of our captain .   `` Are you sure you made contact with them after all ? ''   `` I suppose so . ''   `` That 's *not* what I mean . It 's just that they were n't friendly . And a few of them were n't here until this morning , so that 's everything . ''   We heard the rumbling in the ship again . We did n't want to take chances .   `` My dear captain , we are beginning contact with the Earthlings . ''   *CRACK*   Everyone gasped , and we all looked around .   `` What did they do to us ? ! '' asked my captain .   `` It 's possible they were sent out to destroy the humans , but I think they had no intention of destroying them . ''   We all looked at each other , confused .   `` That 's not possible ! '' exclaimed another voice from above us .   `` What do you mean ? ! '' cried my captain .   `` They used to be a peaceful people , but now they 're monsters ! ''   I looked down at my feet , terrified . What could my captain possibly be talking about ?   `` What do we do ? ''   `` You could do anything , '' said another voice from the sea .   `` What is *that* ? ''   `` I think this is the first time we see it . ''   ***   Any tips or critiques are welcome ! Check out /r/Draxagon
`` Hey , uh ... ''   `` You know , I go to the store every Tuesday . Or Tuesday . '' I shook my head , realizing everyone else was looking at me .   `` No , no , no . ''   `` Well ... ''   `` Yeah . It 's my shoes , '' I said , `` and I drive . I 'm in the middle of town . Not all of the time . ''   `` Okay . So , I see four people there , in the middle of nowhere . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` And then they get to me and everything just crashes down around me . ''   `` Sounds good . ''   `` Well , I see them walking over my shoe and then I see what happens . ''   I nodded , realizing everyone else was staring .   `` I see them getting their shoes , and I see them running , and then they get to me and everything just crashes down around me . ''   I nodded , realizing everyone else was looking at me .   `` So , then it starts . ''   `` No . ''   `` No . ''   `` So I start walking over my shoe and then , and then I see those two people walking on their shoes . Now , everyone is staring at me and I realize what 's happening . ''   I nodded , realizing everyone else was looking at me .   `` So , this is really just because I could n't believe my eyes . ''   I nodded , realizing everyone else was looking at me .   `` So I start going to the store every Tuesday . Or Tuesday . Or Tuesday . Or Tuesday . Or Thursday . Or Friday . Or whichever day it is . ''   They looked at me , and I just nodded my head .   `` Hey , uh ... ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` Hey , uh ... ''
`` You 'll find this guy a lot less impressive . ''   `` I 've never seen a more impressive guy . ''   `` It 's not like he 's using security . I mean , a bit more efficient than you think with everything that 's going on with him . ''   `` This is n't for you . ''   `` Calm down . I want this guy to suffer . ''   `` Okay then . Now , let 's figure this out . ''   `` Why do you want your guy to suffer ? ''   `` Because , like , well , I think he 's not sure why he 's in here . ''   `` Ah . Well there he goes . ''   I leaned back in my chair , looking at the blood splattered onto the wall . `` And what does it look like ? '' I asked the man , looking back down at the blood on the wall . `` We 've got a couple of lines of code around it . I just got this . ''   `` That 's not what would get you this job . ''   I smiled . `` It 's not that bad . ''   `` Yeah , sure . Okay . And so what do you think it 's like ? ''   `` Well , it 's sort of like there 's this ... this thing that 's going around all over the wall and I ca n't turn off it because it 's kinda hard to turn it off . ''   I chuckled .   `` Yeah , you know , we just turn it off because you ca n't turn it off . ''   I rolled my eyes and crossed my arms . `` Listen , I 'm a programmer . I do n't understand what you 're talking about , but it 's kinda cool to have someone working with a software to do it . ''   `` I hate your idea of security , '' the man said , his voice getting quieter . `` So what does that mean ? It 's too risky . Now , can you just ignore the security ?   `` Okay , hold on . I 'm guessing you 're right . ''   `` Okay . '' I sat back down , feeling my stomach rumble . `` Okay . ''   `` Okay . ''   I sighed , closing my eyes . `` Okay , see about this . ''   I leaned back in my chair , looking at the man . `` I mean , actually , now , I just saw this guy go through some work on a different hardware . He 's a nice guy , but I do n't know how he got himself into this kind of thing . ''   `` He just kind of ... sort of went for IT ? ''   `` No , it 's not that bad . He just -- '' the man stopped himself . `` Yeah , it sounded like that . ''   `` I do n't even know what it sounds like to be in a computer . ''   `` I do n't know how you do that , but it sounds weird to me . ''   I leaned back in my chair , looking at the blood on the floor . `` Does that mean you 're actually a hacker , too ? ''   `` I just -- ''   `` Yeah , yeah , I just do it for fun . ''   `` I know , I know . ''   `` Okay . So , I just ... try this . *try* this . ''   `` I need to know what this stuff is . I mean it sounds real , but it 's way too risky . I ca n't just go through all the security with a guy like yourself . ''   `` Yeah , well that sounded like an excellent idea , but I should n't have you getting paid up for this . That 's all . ''   `` I 'm sorry , but it 's *very* risky . I 'm not making this any easier for you . You either , or you shut your eyes and forget about this whole thing . So , I 'll just go through the code . ''   `` You wo n't shut your eyes until you see what happens . ''   `` I just understand . I 'll just -- ''   `` You 'll just shut your eyes and- ''   I turned off my computer .   `` Well , I guess I 'll just close my eyes and accept that just then ,
It was a year ago when we discovered we had a bad habit of calling ourselves heroes . We were constantly bullied , our jobs were so miserable that our lives , our lives , were basically shit . We 'd spend our days trying to fight crime , but we just had to keep trying .   My name is Jason Stiller . I 'm an asshole .   So , when that news hit , I started doing research on villains . I spent all my money on people that wanted to be heroes , and I studied them for something . Life was not perfect , but I was a good student and paid a good college tuition , and I got my degree .   Eventually , I gave in . It was just a matter of time before I saw the truth in their eyes .   To be honest , we did n't understand what any of it was . When the superheroes saved the world , we did n't understand why any of the police force had to go into a fight . When it was us , they just looked at each other and said , `` We 'll always be superheroes '' .   Then we realized that the problem was that the superheroes were different than us . They did n't need to protect us , because if they needed to keep us safe , they needed to keep me going . They 'd always do the right thing , to help each other out , to help them all get better .   I had to stop that .   I was the perfect hero . Even without the help of some people , I did everything I could to help people . I made friends , fought the bad guys , bought land , and even helped the police get away with it . I knew exactly what to do , and I did n't want to keep it out of my life .   I 'm now sitting here , in front of a computer , waiting for every news story to start . We 've always been heroes , but now , I just want to let them know .
He told me he needed one .   I sat with the others in the back , watching the shadows shift and morph . Staggering over onto my head , I looked around at the others , their huddled messes of makeup all over them . They were all dead , though . No one else had ever shown up .   `` We can not leave this place , '' he said , taking a few steps towards me . `` We can not come back . ''   `` We could ! '' I screamed out , fighting back tears .   He smiled sadly and gave me a big hug . He motioned me to get on my knees , and I do . My head follows him , my mind trying desperately to comprehend what was happening . His smile widens .   My eyes pop open to see a dark figure hunched over , with his mouth agape . He steps over to me and places a hand on my cheek . His grip is firm , and I feel my heart drop as he brings his fist back onto my cheek .   My eyes close , and my voice echoes through the crowd . My vision goes black .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I try to focus my right eye on the figure crouching down beside me , the mask glancing over his shoulder . He holds out a hand , and I find it shaking uncontrollably .   He strokes my cheek , but I do not move . No ! Please do n't leave ! Please ! Please !   He lifts his hand and I do as he says . My hand is shaking uncontrollably , unable to hold my hand off him . The darkness begins to envelop me , until I am alone between the shadows .   I remember her face - the one that looked like my own . Her eyes , their glow , their skin . But there were no eyes , no faces to remember me . My eyes opened as my eyes felt the darkness seep over me .   I did not know what I was seeing . I did not know how long it had been , and what happened when I opened my eyes . I felt my consciousness being sucked into a void .   `` Please DO N'T leave ! '' I cried into nothingness .   My body slowly degenerates into a ball , my consciousness becoming void once more , my consciousness losing everything but a memory as I lay there motionless , unable to move .   When I woke up , my body was completely still , and I felt the cool blue of the sky on my face . It felt like I was floating away from the sky . I looked down to see the ground had begun to buckle underneath me , leaving me to feel the ground shake uncontrollably . The only thing that could move was the ground . Slowly , I rose from my bed , my back ached from the weight of the world , the pain of losing my mother ; my father .   I lay there crying , unable to get up . Tears welled up in my eyes as I opened my eyes again .   I started to walk towards the edge of the world , and the feeling of being falling was overwhelming . I reached the edge of the world , and I realized I had no direction . My eyes were locked on some small object that I could barely see to my left . Then , I began to make my way towards it .   It was a mask , a mask . No one in the world could see it . No one except my mother . My entire world was turning blurry as I made my way towards it . Something was off .   I began rubbing my arms and legs , and tried to clear my eyes . But my body was completely unable . I became distracted by the light . My tears were streaming down my face as I tried to figure out what it was . Then , a vision began to form . It caught my eye , one that was familiar to me , but had a strange feeling . It was a mask that glowed with the light of the stars . I tried to move it , but I could n't .   I saw some strange shapes , floating through the air below me . It seemed as though they were flying through the air , floating towards me . As I tried to stay focused , a shape appeared . It was humanoid , and had a long , cylindrical body that was resembling nothing compared to the other characters I had seen . It was shaped like metal , with a mouth with some sort of metal-like appendage underneath the ends . It was very large
*What if I 'm one of them ? * I wondered . *They 'll keep doing this . * I 'd heard it before , and it was true . All nations would start with “ One. ” The first name would be chosen once you had been born . It was the death sentence of everyone from birth to birth . But then the name would be changed . And then it would be spoken to you .   But I had never spoken to anyone . I had n't spoken to anybody . I had n't spoken to anybody . The only people I knew were the ones I lived with . I worked with them , and they trusted me . They knew me . They still did . I asked them about my name , and they said the same thing . None of them cared . They were going to tell me my name that day .   I wondered why they did this to me . I tried looking around . I tried to find a way to stop them .   I walked to the bus stop to pick myself up . I looked at the letters left in front of me . “ One. ” Why did they choose my name ? I did n't know . I was n't one of them .   “ Two. ”   But I was n't the kind of person that did n't care . I did n't know what to do . So I decided to stay . I drove home . I took a deep breath , and I pulled up to the road .   I parked , and I watched as the bus took off . I watched as the doors closed , and the driver stepped out . He smiled , and he opened his hands to show me who I was .   “ You ? ” he asked . I nodded , and he pulled out a cigarette . I sat down , and he lit one . My mouth went dry . I looked at myself in the mirror . “ You 're not like me. ”   I laughed , and told him it was a false illusion . “ Please , don't call me that again . I can change the world ! ”   “ Please ! ” he cried . “ I can change it ! ”   “ Just get off the bus . You 're not gon na see him any time soon. ” I told him . It was true . I was not their type .   He put down the phone , and walked away . I was going to see him soon .   I looked at my house . I made my way down the stairs , and jumped into his arms . My heart broke . My body shook .   “ Hi. ” I said . “ How 's it going , guys ? ”   “ No problems. ” He said . He reached his hand out , and he took it . “ It 's just a prank . You 'll be fine. ”   I took it . I stared at him , and I stared back . Then I looked down at my body . “ It was fake. ” I told myself . Then I got out of hand .   My eyes darted around , and the tears began to form in my eyes . I cried heavily , and I hugged him .   “ I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I love you. ” I said . I kissed him gently on the cheek .   “ You 're not my type. ” He looked at me , and I smiled . “ We 'll always do this. ”   ______________________   Criticisms ? Want to read more ? Just write more ?

`` General ! The admiral 's orders are clear ! ''   The Admiral sighed and made a note of his notes while scrolling through the document on his tablet . He needed a moment to take in the situation .   He had been ordered to be a new member of his fleet to protect the galaxy from the galactic threat , and now , the galaxy was in danger .   `` These people have been terrorizing the galaxy ! It 's time . ''   The Admiral smiled with relief . The universe was saved from this , because of its mistakes , and that meant they would forever regret them .   `` General , '' the admiral began , `` they are no longer here to kill us . They are here to fight back . ''   With his face buried in his hands , the Admiral felt an overwhelming force pull away from him and he found himself floating up into the sky .   The Admiral stood there , awestruck at the sight of a starship slowly disappearing into the blackness beneath them . `` What has happened ? ''   The admiral looked at the screen , and just as quickly turned his gaze back to the Admiral .   The admiral blinked . `` What ? Who are these people ? ''   The admiral laughed . `` The admiral will show you the secrets of the galaxy . ''   With that , he left .
`` Hey , Steve , '' I said as I took a step back from the couch , `` How many times do I have to tell you something ? ''   `` Four , '' he replied with a shrug as was proper for him .   `` Not to that ! '' I growled at him . I could feel his anger welling up inside me . He could n't control it any longer , and I was n't afraid to end up like this .   `` What 's the matter , man ? '' His eyes narrowed as he noticed I had trouble remembering his name .   `` I 'm going to change it , Steve . '' I replied , `` I 'll be back with you , take care of yourself ! ''   I grabbed his arm as quickly as I could , and lifted him up to my feet . I saw the room and knew that it was already full of people who had been waiting for me .   `` Thank you , Steve . '' Came the voice . `` You were so great ! ''   `` Thanks too , '' I replied as I walked to grab the phone and call 911 .   `` Can you call 911 ? '' I asked as I began dialing . I knew the answer , but I did n't care anymore . I had enough money to buy something and I was going to make it look like a scam .   `` Hello ? '' Said my friend , who was sitting on the couch . `` Hello ? What 's this ? ! ''   I went over to him and pulled the phone from his hands . It was a black , faded yellow , and a picture was inside . A young man had been watching me as I stood by the man 's side a moment earlier . I looked once more at the man who had watched me before .   `` Who is this ? '' He said incredulously .   `` I 'm James . James Wayne . ''
`` Hey Ben ''   Ben 's voice startled me , I 'm really confused . Usually when he 's quiet he 's like `` What ? ''   I 'm still wondering how he got there . I 've only seen him for like an hour before but it looks like he 's about to tell me something .   `` Ben , I think someone found the wormhole . We need to get out . ''   I 'm afraid to ask him how he got there . I do n't know where he came from either . Maybe he did n't bring the wormhole or something .   `` Ben , you did n't bring it on purpose . I do n't know who else came to open the wormhole but I swear if you do n't shut up then the wormhole will swallow you whole . ''   I 'm looking around for the wormhole before I hear a sound . The sound of my mother crying in the distance . The sound of her gun-grunts ringing into the night . The sound of her family . I can do nothing but stare at this , trying to tell it to stop .   `` Ben , I know you did n't mean it . ''   `` What 's wrong Ben ? Where are you ? ''   `` I 'm home . I 'm sorry son . ''   They 're leaving .
Coffee day huh ?   That 's right , I just walked in the door to my first birthday party ! Did you know that they were still open ?   Actually , they 're not , so why did you come in ? I thought I 'd see their faces , but there 's only one thing I can do ; make it count !   *Ring ... ring ... ring ... ring ... ring ... *   I open the door , and the crowd looks on in awe . I quickly get dressed , and prepare myself for a party .   *Ring ... ring ... ring ... *   `` Haha ... '' I say to the cheering crowd , `` It 's like I 've just fallen asleep ! ''   The crowd immediately looks on in disbelief , and then back to me with awe .   *Ring ... ring ... *   `` Wow ! '' I say to the crowd , `` I have never seen such a good party ! ''   `` Haha ... '' the crowd whispers to each other , `` This is such a great party , it never seems to end ! ''   `` Haha ... '' I say to the crowd , `` Oh , wow ! I think that 's something ! ''   `` Haha ... '' the crowd whispers to everyone in the room , `` Wow ! I think that 's something ! ''   `` Haha ... '' the crowd whispers to each other , `` Wow ! I think that 's something ! ''   `` Haha ... '' the crowd whispers to each other , `` Wow ! I think that 's something ! ''   `` Haha ... '' the crowd whispers to each other , `` Oh , wow ! I thought that 's something ! ''   `` Haha ...

I woke up one morning with a jolt . Something was off . I felt like I had slept a dozen lifetimes . Everything was blurry around me , as I tried to figure out my surroundings . I still had no recollection of my first time in this world . Then I felt it . It was a sense of dread : the fear of returning to the previous day . I remembered my first few lifetimes -- and my second , each one taking place before me . It filled me with terror and horror , but in return I kept the same terrified expression :   `` What is this ? '' I said aloud . I reached for the light switch . The beam of light suddenly shot through the room and engulfed me directly in a burning sensation . I felt like I was in an eternity . There was no pain , no pain . I felt like a thousand lifetimes that were no longer counting , the same as when the first timer started to tick down .   I tried to speak , but it was hard to do so . I could n't move . There was no pain . The pain began to fade into nothingness . I saw nothing . I was all I had ever known . This was reality , and I could no longer exist . I felt naked , and I could n't move a muscle . I was becoming powerless .   It hit me in my head . I thought about the time I had spent in this world . It was n't any different than any other . I could n't remember what it was I woke up in in . It was just like any other day in my life . I remembered my first lifetimes -- but this time was different . It seemed as though I did n't understand my own surroundings anymore . Somehow I remember all of the places the familiar memories of the previous two lifetimes ended . The first was the first time I had visited a hospital . It was the first time I had eaten breakfast . The second was the first time I had had sex . I would never forget how much we shared . We lived our lives together through each others ' memories , yet we shared the same experiences each other shared -- like the two of us shared everything . We had the same memories as the first time we shared lunch together .   Olsen : `` Are you ready to go to the doctor ? '' I asked .   Olsen : `` Yes , I 'll be there in 15 minutes '' , I replied . The hospital room was bright and white except for the occasional shadow coming over the walls . The Doctor arrived just before I walked in . He examined me , and then looked directly into my eyes . I said the words that I wanted to say , and then he looked away . He turned away from me and walked back to the room door .   I moved again . I tried to talk again , but there was no words to say . I was confused . I could n't move , but I could still see . I saw everything again . I saw the doctors and nurses , and I saw the nurses and nurses and doctors and nurses and doctors and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and doctors and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and doctors and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and doctors and patients and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses and nurses , and I saw everything again .   *I* was in an eternity .
The building was like a house .   Two stories tall with concrete supports , two windows , a roof , and some stairs leading to the roof . One was empty , the other still standing .   For one , the buildings were just a house .   For the other , they were more like a house , and they resembled something out of a horror movie . leece .   Like , a house .   I turned to look at the ground . The floor was still empty , and it was n't only empty , but it was also full of people . I stared at the building for a moment , wondering why the building was in such poor condition . I 'll never know , but I think I could feel the city 's air rushing through my body . I realized that I had n't felt it since I was a little girl . I had n't felt anything ; my mouth had n't tasted anything . I had n't felt the pain in my heart , or my lungs , or my lungs , or the breath of any living thing I knew . I had n't felt warmth or cold or anything . My whole body felt like it was being held in a vice hold ; It was cold , but it was warm . Like , warm .   Perhaps that 's why I kept going down the stairs until I reached the bottom .   It was dark out , and there were no stars in the city .   I could hardly see through the window .   But the sky was a lot different than I remembered it coming from .   It lit up like an orange fire and started to grow toward the top . It was hot to look at , and the wind threw me back . I was thrown to the ground and pulled my body free .   I pulled out , still holding my breath , and tried to get back up , but I was stuck , even as my body tried to move . The building was gone . The last thing I remember was a bang . The wind was roaring behind me , the heat of it was blinding .   I had n't felt the wind in years .
The snowstorm had hit almost immediately , and it swept down the trees and the trees faster than any heat could hold them down . It was as if snow had been poured down a river , as if someone was carrying a water balloon . The sun had set , and we were both looking at light .    I tried to pull myself up , but I was stuck in a tree after all . I looked around at the trees - most of them had fallen far from our original positions , and some had fallen in the snow . Once you were all in the same position .    I was having trouble breathing . I was getting hungrier . I tried to reach for a cigarette , but the tree branches were n't too far behind me . I thought I might lose consciousness , and looked around to see if anyone else had been there .    I heard a faint wind call attention to the trees . I reached for the pack of cigarettes that had fallen out of nowhere - I was about to start inhaling it when something started to move . As I turned my head to look , I hit something hard . The branch was so small that I almost knocked it out of view . I looked off in space , and saw a figure approach .    Its eyes were all black , which was astonishing . The face was covered in black with strange features and was covered in odd features to add to the pitch blackness . The body was covered in a strange cloth that looked like nothing I had seen before .    I was stunned . What ... was this ? I started to panic , and was surprised to find that someone from the shadows had stopped moving , and looked around .    No one was moving either .    And then , there was silence . Then , I heard a voice , a voice that sounded a little bit higher than it should have been ... but definitely not my own .    `` I see you have returned to Earth . ''
Raphrodite took a deep breath and closed the book . He rubbed his nose where it had fallen off since the day he saw the spell . He scratched his mustache . It was a few minutes from now the spell would be activated and there would be no repercussions . His head pounded . It would be a long time before he could finally come up with a way to stop this spell ! He sighed . The book was starting to feel old . It was n't that it was old . It was old enough to be a spell . It was old enough to hold a conversation with people and it was old enough to be useful . He could at least try , and try and learn everything he could .   A knock came at the door .   `` Come in ! ''   The tall , black man in the doorway could be seen standing at the door . He looked down at his book and peered into his book . He looked up with a puzzled expression . Raphrodite could n't help but smile at the man .   `` Hi there , '' the man said as he stepped in . `` I have to go back to my job today . ''   Raphrodite looked down at the book . It had fallen from his hand . It had fallen over and he began to try to wipe it off . The spell had been triggered when he was ten and it had only taken one spell before he had found his way back . He could barely get up . He was so exhausted , his eyes were wide .   `` Hey , you alright ? '' The man said .   Raphrodite looked up at the man . He could n't see . He felt as if he wanted to cry . He wanted to tell him that his life was worth living . Instead he was staring out the window , at the park and at the life that existed beyond the window .   `` I 'm fine , '' the man said . `` I 'm just ... uh.. I did n't mean to upset you , but it 's kind of a lot to take in . ''   Raphrodite looked at the man , wide-eyed at his own self . His mind had been swirling around this spell for a long time . He was n't sure if he had ever realized what it could do but he could still try . He had tried it for years , always trying , but he never had the courage to try it again . He did n't want to believe this was real ! The man looked at Raphrodite with tears in his eyes .   `` But you do remember , '' the man said , `` every time you watch TV , you know that it 's always been your time to do something . As long as it lasts . ''   Raphrodite looked at himself . He was crying now . Tears streamed down his face .   `` I-I do n't know who I am . ''   `` I did n't know you were there . '' He said . `` You did n't know what you were doing . You did n't know ... how to do that . ''   He continued to stare at the man .   `` I was getting pregnant . I was going to ... go . I never bothered to tell you , '' he said , staring at the floor . `` I would have known that I would do that . ''   The man collapsed into a puddle on the ground . Raphrodite looked at the man and saw the sadness that he saw every day that he had seen . He could n't see anything down there , not a twinkle or sound . His head throbbed . He wanted to cry . To go back home . But he could n't . There was nothing left to say . His head became heavy . It felt like his soul was going to collapse . He slowly walked over to Raphrodite .   `` I 'm so sorry for what happened , '' he said . `` I should have called your family . ''   Raphrodite looked around . It was dark as night outside and the moon was just beginning to rise over the land . He took a deep breath and closed the book . `` Raphrodite , you have to go back to your job tomorrow . ''   Raphrodite took a deep breath and closed the book . He closed his eyes .
`` Y'know , I 'm nervous about this , '' she said , reaching for his hand .   `` Do n't be nervous , '' he replied sheepishly .   `` I 'm just nervous about what I 'll say to you . ''   `` And you 'll just ... . ''   `` But I 'll say it anyway . ''   `` Well , '' he said , `` I 'll say it 's cool . ''   She looked down at the floor , her eyes wide with ecstasy . She ran her hands through his long , green hair . She was on his waist , holding him in her arms . He was breathing in deeply , breathing in deeply , breathing in deeply .   `` I 'll say it , '' she said .   `` I 'd love it if I could . ''   `` Do n't worry about it , '' he said .   And with one smooth motion , she grabbed her hand ...
My name is Jack .   I was three years old when the villagers attacked me .   The villagers cut me alive with their butchering axes . I could n't hear them anymore . I was afraid . Fear so strong and pure that any child could understand it . I kept screaming . I kept hearing what was being heard .   But it stopped before I heard the sounds of my footsteps .   I called out again . I could n't hear them anymore .   I was scared . So I threw up on the floor .   There I was , my face covered in blood . I tried to run but I had to die . I was alive .   What did I do ? I do n't know .   Until ...   I saw a man . He was sitting on the wooden platform . He seemed to be a pretty young man . I was confused .   The man looked at me .   `` Do n't worry . I 'll get you home soon enough . We 'll talk about this . ''   And that was it . I was free . I was free .
The book was old and dusty ,  In the hands of my husband .   I had spent years contemplating the book  When I realised I was old .   After all these years ,  My life 's work has finally paid off .  I can finally remember the day  Did I miss him ?   I lay on my recliner ,  The sheets of my bedsheets  And fell asleep like I 'd never been  Before .   I did n't know if I could dream  But I laid there ,  Waiting for him to wake .  Waiting for the end .   When I woke up I found myself laying alone .  I could n't sleep , but I knew I had to .  I laid there for what felt like hours ,  Of waiting for him to wake .   Then I started to feel the weightlessness of the book .  I knew he was n't safe  But he was always out there  Waiting for me , waiting for me .   Eventually I found myself in a tiny room  In some abandoned part of town .  I was trying to help him , I knew he had to .   I laid there in shock ,  Waiting for him to wake .   Soon I realized I had to .  It was n't till I was about to go  did the strength in me slip .   I tried to stand up , but every time I looked down  I could n't move .  I tried to make out just what I saw .   This ... this ... this ... this ... this ... this ... this .   I stopped , afraid that I might be wrong .  I decided to move on ,  But when I got up I could n't .   I looked down ,  And saw myself at the end of my bed .  I had never been to this part of town before .  I stared at the floor ,  And saw myself lying there ,  Waiting to wake .   When I woke , I was wearing a thick , black slacks  And red plaid jackets .  I looked up at the sky ,  And saw sun-bleached grass .  I looked down at the ground ,  And saw grass that looked peaceful and white .  I smiled .   `` Thank you so much , '' I said .  I stood up , and stood up ,  And walked out the door .   I walked through a door and into a dark room .  I looked up to see him sitting there ,  Just staring at something .   I opened a door and walked in .  I knew he was gone .  I could n't give up .   `` I 'm so sorry , I missed you so much '' , I begged .   `` I still do n't understand , '' he said , `` I 've lived to see you all . ''   `` You did n't mean to '' , I replied .   `` Still do n't understand . ''   I laid there , tears streaming down my cheeks ,  And tried to make out just what I saw .   The last thing I saw was him standing there .  He was a man . I was n't supposed to be here .  And he looked at me with a sad smile .
`` Good morning gentlemen , my name is Zeus ''   `` What is it Zeus ? ''   `` Let me ask you something Zeus . Can you pull off your belt ? ''   The god of war looks around the room . He pulls off his belt in hopes of getting a better look at Zeus . He looks through the crowd towards the gods . He sees a crowd of people and a crowd of God . They all had them in suits and they all were standing at the gate , looking at each other and laughing . They all wore black and had tattoos all over their body . Zeus then places his hand on the gate , pulling it back up with his other palm . ''   `` I see Zeus , the people of Olympus are very interested in watching you . ''   `` I see , good-bye Zeus . ''   Zeus smiles and then he hears Zeus say `` I hope you enjoyed your stay in Olympus . ''   `` The name escapes my lips . Let me pass it to the God of the Damned . ''   Zeus turns back to the mob . Then Zeus pulls his belt on the gate and pulls it inside to reveal a black shirt with the number O.S . written on them . Zeus puts his foot on the gate and then pulls it open . Inside , he sees a small square with a large circular door .   `` The Goddesses have invited you inside . ''  Olympus 's voice cracks .   `` She has invited you inside , and on her birth certificate is there a small number that says 6 ' 9 ' ''  The crowd grows silent . Zeus sees a small woman sitting at the table .   `` Please sit down . '' The woman says .   The crowd starts to gather around the woman whom Zeus saw earlier . Zeus pulls a small glass of wine from his pocket and puts it on the table .   `` Thanks , Zeus . I would n't mind if you just took a seat . ''   Zeus takes a sip of his wine , then pulls a small baggie out of the back of his pants . He opens it with a gaudy , gold-encrusted paper baggie . He then flips it open and finds a large gold star in the middle of it . He then places it on the table as well . He grabs the gold star and puts it in the bag . He pulls out a small silver coin . He tosses it over to Zeus . He then starts walking away .   Zeus 's eyes widen . He quickly picks up his red , gold ball , and puts the coins in the bag .   `` I shall take you there to Olympus ' s temple . ''

**Oh , shit ! **   Steve 's ghostly form appears in my backyard . It 's slightly overweight , with grey hair and dark circles under its eyes . I can hear thundering down the hill as it is approaching me .   `` Steve , it 's me ! ''   As I approach , I notice that Steve 's body is missing from the ground . He looks to be in pain from hitting his head with a brick wall . The ghostly figure reaches for an imaginary knife and stabs it into my back . At that moment , I hear one more thunderous noise coming down the hill .   `` Steve ! ! ''   *Shit , * I think to myself . *Another one . *   *Oh God . I 'm going crazy . *   `` I need your help ! ''   Steve 's head pops around and I feel the ghostly figure wrap itself around the ghostly body . With a sharp , blood curdling scream , Steve falls to the ground .   *Oh god , no . I 'm going crazy . Aww , fuck . *   `` No ! '' Steve screams , his body hitting the spot where the light shined down .   `` What are you going to do to my son ? ''   `` Oh , shit ! I 'm going crazy ! ''   `` Steve , what 's going on ? ''   `` I 'm going to kill my son ! ''   I look down at my hands in horror . I have never felt so scared in my life . I slowly turn over to sit to my wife , and she leans in closer . She is smiling and holds out a hand to me .   `` Steve , what are you going to do to your son ? ''   `` I 'm going to kill my son ! ''   `` What are you going to do to your son ? ''   `` I 'm going to kill my son ! ''   `` Steve , who is that man ? ''   `` I 'm going to kill him ! ''   Steve stares at me blankly . Confused , I say , `` What ? ''   `` Steve , what is this ? ''   `` I 'm going to kill my son ! ''   `` Steve , what is this ? ''   *No . I killed my son ! *   `` Steve , what 's going on ? ''   `` It 's not my son anymore ! It 's Steve . It 's Steve ! IT 'S Steve ! ''   Steve ca n't put his finger on it , but I immediately feel myself falling backwards . The ghostly figure 's hand connects with my face . I feel my eyes closing as Steve falls to the ground .   *Oh God . *   **********   *Well , at least it makes sense after all . I hope you like it . * 
**Wept in the Sky**   She sat on the edge of the bed , her eyes closed .   She was n't as weak as she used to be .   She could do nothing but lay there , resting , her head in her lap , in the cool morning air .   Her dreams were the only thing keeping her alive .   She was so close .   She was almost free .   She could be anyone , everyone .   She was the happiest she had ever been .   She could n't .   The water was cold outside , and the smell of burnt skin and burnt flesh permeated the room .   She could n't swim .   She could n't live .   She could n't walk to school , or read .   She could n't live alone , or stay home .   She could n't make friends .   She could n't even make friends .   The water seemed to be pouring in on her , and she was writhing in panic .   She closed her eyes and closed them again as her heart began pounding in her chest .   Her body began to convulse .    She stared at the empty bed with utter disbelief .   Was this the end ?   Did she really die ?    
The sky was dark , it seemed .   There was a time when the sky was blue with the sun setting in the distance . However , there was no blue this time .   It was a strange feeling , to me , that your chest really was like a balloon . But it just felt wrong .   I felt like I had never felt this way before . I just knew it was wrong .   I walked down the steps of the house , glancing around . The man next door , my best friend , stood there , looking with an expression of utter discomfort .   It felt like I was being watched .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' I complained .   I walked over to him , took a deep breath , then said , `` Are you sure you 're not dreaming ? Or was it just that you were ? ''   He looked up from his book , looking around . `` I do n't think I was . I do n't think I 'm real . ''   `` Okay . '' I said . I just needed to keep going .   `` There 's a storm brewing at the city . ''   `` Yeah , I 've never been a storm brewing here . ''   `` I know , but I 've never been here before . ''   `` I have n't been here since the invention of a sleeping pill . ''   `` I do n't think so . ''   I stared at him skeptically . `` I have never been here before . ''   `` You called it a 'night pill ' ? ''   `` I do n't think so . I do n't have the heart to say it . ''   `` Is it a dream ? ''   `` I ca n't remember . ''   `` What do you mean , 'dreaming ' ? ''   `` I do n't know . I do n't know what the hell these people are talking about . ''   I looked at him for a few seconds . `` Why are you doing this ? ''   He looked up from his book . `` It 's not that bad . We 've become used to this sort of stuff . They come here every morning , and they just ... they call it a day . No , I think it 's about time they actually stop . ''   `` Yeah , I do n't really get it ... ''   `` It does n't matter , right ? Who do you think is out there ? ''   `` Who 's out there ? ''   `` Nobody that I know , except for you . ''   `` What the hell is going on ? ''   `` You do n't know this , right ? Except for me . ''   `` What are you going to do ? ''   `` I do n't want to wake up . I do n't want to go back to this house . ''   `` Alright . '' He pointed to the open window , where he was waiting .   `` I do n't want to see you again . ''   `` And what about you ? ''   `` I do n't want to go back to the house . ''   And so we went back to the house .   *****   I was in the passenger seat of the car , sitting in front , when the driver walked in .   `` So , do you remember anything that happened today ? ''   `` If I recall , it 's been the same recurring thing every night . I think it 's the same thing every night for the last year . ''   `` No , it 's not anything like that . This has happened before . ''   `` Yeah , well , like , what if you were a dream- ''   `` I tried to call someone . No response . ''   `` Yeah , well , that explains why we could n't hear him . ''   *Click . *   *****   I woke up in front of the town hall . I waited for the person to come in , so I could reach out to him . But he did n't come .   `` What have you done , honey ? ''   `` I 've been working . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I -- I
For a week , the hero had worked alone . He was a superhero , a hero like everyone , a protector of humanity . He worked at a small local power plant . And then , he 'd accidentally run into a girl . She 'd turned around , and he 'd walked to the end of the hallway .   `` What the hell ! And who are you ? '' he screamed .   `` You are *The Good Samaritan* . '' said the girl .   `` What do you mean ? Who are you ? ''   `` Oh god , '' she said . `` You brought this up . ''   `` I-I brought it up ! '' he said . `` I 'm the good Samaritan ! I 'm stopping crime ! ''   `` You 're going to kill us all ? '' asked the girl .   The girl nodded . `` Yes , '' she said , and closed her eyes . `` But it 's not *your* fault , it 's your own . ''   `` I 'm not ! What are you saying ? ''   `` It 's not your fault , it 's not your fault ! That 's why you 're doing it . ''   `` It 's your fault , '' she said . `` You just wanted to- ''   The girl blinked . `` No-no no no . No , no , no . '' She turned away . `` It 's not your fault , it 's your fault . '' She looked at the girl again , to her eyes . `` Wait , '' she said . `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` I thought I saw you running down the hallway , '' said the girl . `` But this time I 'm looking at you ! ''   `` I have a face ! '' he said . Her head spun around in surprise . `` I 'm not ... I 'm not a hero ! I 'm just- ''   `` What 've you done ? '' she said . `` What have you done to deserve this ? ''   `` I ca n't remember ! '' said the girl . `` I was supposed to *smell* the blood ! I was supposed to *do* something about this ! ''   `` What 's wrong with you ? '' asked the villain . He had the bright blue eyes that everybody else 's eyes were . `` You 've ruined the city ! You 've robbed it and polluted it . You 've destroyed people that used to love you . Because of that , we 've been going somewhere else , and we 've come back here , and the city 's safe now ! ''   `` You wanted to kill us all ? '' asked the villain . `` You did n't kill us all ? ''   A small smile slipped across the girl 's lips . `` Oh , '' she said . `` You want to die . ''   `` I gave up ... '' the villain said . `` I gave up my choice . I just wanted to die . ''   She smiled . `` That 's what makes everyone else happy . ''   `` Yeah , yeah . ''   `` What about your dad ? '' she asked . `` What about your girlfriend ? ''   `` What about your brother ? ''   `` What ? ''   The villain sighed . `` What about your brother ? ''   `` What about your daughter ? ''   `` What about your brother ? ''   `` What about your girlfriend ? ''   The villain frowned . `` What about your wife ? ''   The girl grinned so wide her eyes almost bulged . `` Jesus ! '' she gasped . `` What about your girlfriend ? ''   The villain narrowed his eyes . `` She said she could n't live with herself . I thought it was just the brain matter , '' he muttered .   `` What about your girlfriend ? '' she said . `` I ca n't remember ! I- ''   He glanced over at the villain again . `` She 's ... she 's dead . ''   `` You killed your wife ? ''   `` No . '' He repeated . `` I 'm dead . ''   `` What did you do to deserve this ? ''   `` I was supposed to *smell* the blood ! I was supposed to- ''   The villain rolled his eyes . `` You 've killed my wife , you 've ruined the city ! You
I had fought this before , but I never could keep up with her in my life . I started out so innocently and I was not stupid . I always had a plan , every time I tried . This time I thought I would save her . We were in my house , I was under attack . I began to flee when I realized she was gone . I never felt as a responsible person for me , but I thought I would do the same to her .   I ran out of the house , and ran from her . I was so scared of her , so scared of what could happen to her . As I ran into the woods , it dawned on me . This was n't her , it was my love . I had to save her , I had to save her . I looked for her , but I found nothing . I was not safe , I was not angry , I was just tired of her .   I got so good at thinking , I thought of how beautiful she was and went with it . I went into a cave and went for a breath . I just kept running . I always had a plan , every time I tried . This time I thought it would save her . I was so scared of her , so scared . I was so concerned that I was going to kill her , but I did n't know what to do .   I suddenly found a cave , and I ran to it . I thought I would save her , but I was so scared that I was going to kill her . I was so worried that I was going to kill her , but I was so wrong . I ran in the cave and I was terrified that I was going to be killed . I thought I would save her , but I was wrong .   I tried to save her , but I was so wrong . I ran into the cave and the cave was filled with water . Slowly , the water began to flow . Everything went from dark purple to pink , and I could see it through the darkness . I thought , `` what if I am too selfish ? ''   Then everything went black   
`` You are a sick fuck '' said the cashier .   `` I do n't understand '' said the man in the grey jumpsuit who would often call himself Robert .   `` Ok sir '' Robert replied . `` I 'll get you everything you need . ''   Robert and his fellow customers walked into the checkout room and sat in their offices looking around the shopping center . It was n't that they did n't appreciate the store , but they found it fascinating that they did n't even have to eat on their own , because if they did someone would probably take them to the checkout to buy more .   The shopping center was a small one , but this was definitely a place for the people of America . Sure there were plenty of people who did n't have the same things as everyone else , but if you talked to them they did n't want to talk to them , so there was n't really much to say . Robert was n't particularly friendly with people . Just a simple salesman , kind of making them just want milk .   Robert decided to speak . `` What 's the matter here ? '' The cashier asked .   `` Nothing sir ''   `` Excellent ! What do you mean ? ''   `` Nothing , all I have is enough milk . ''   `` That 's understandable ! What you ask for sir ? ''   `` All I have to do is buy more so you can get more . ''   `` That 's not fair ! ''   `` Then who gives a fuck about the milk ? ''   `` Well , you could say that I 'd like to buy more than you ever would ! If you ask me to , I could just pick something I could call a 'special ' ''   `` What is the special about being able to buy more ? ''   `` I 've just asked you the 'special ' question , so you better be careful sir . ''   `` You mean I can just buy more ? ''   `` Yes ! Absolutely ! ''   `` You ca n't just want more , please ... ''   Robert 's eyes locked onto Robert 's heart .   *Damn it . I ca n't buy more than five milkshakes . * 
The dragon snorted . His breath was raw .   If only he had known better . He was the last dragon on earth .  The creature inhaled . `` I was born out of fire . ''   `` Yes . '' The dragon let his massive belly give way to sheer size and body mass . He lifted his head back to view the sky with the intensity of a true dragon enjoying .   `` Tell me , why did you choose this route ? '' The dragon yawned , his wings growing longer and longer with each passing hour .   `` I was born out of fear . '' The dragon was getting older . He felt the heat to the back of his throat . `` I was scared of whatever might happen . It seemed like each of us would regret our choices . ''   `` And what was your purpose ? '' The dragon was getting lighter .   `` I destroyed the other dragons . They were nothing more than worthless monsters . ''   `` Look at you . '' The dragon 's stomach was beginning to sag . `` Do you do not understand ? ''   The dragon 's eye was about to curve upwards , towards the horizon . He let out a small sigh . `` Of course I do . ''   The dragon smiled at the young boy . `` Thank you for saving me . ''
`` What ? Oh no ! '' I yell .   The room is bright , shiny and shiny with everything , all the while the voices have no idea what 's going on .   `` You 're telling me ? '' Someone shouts at me .   `` Yeah , you 're telling me ! You 're telling me that this is a test ! ''   The lights come on , now . In the center of the room is a desk , with a chair , and in the middle of it is just a woman , who 's looking scared .   `` I..just want to reach out for them ... '' I say .   `` What ? '' She answers , still confused .   `` Please , just get out of that room . ''   `` I ca n't do it ! ''   `` Okay , now , please try . ''   `` I 'll be right outside , '' she says .   `` You 're right , there 's a building nearby . I can go see this ... ''   I can . I 'm in the lobby . The entrance is locked . It is almost there . I look around for anyone . I see people standing outside outside , staring at me . The receptionist is calling for me .   `` Hey asshole ! '' I yell . `` Hey ! I am going to give you my pass ! ''   The receptionist looks like a woman . This woman is the worst . She has blonde hair . She is wearing a black dress , and dark sunglasses . She 's even wearing this black business suit .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I say . `` I did n't mean to , uh , speak to you , but it was my day off ... . ''   `` What 's wrong with you ? I did n't mean to , um , act like I did n't want to , uh , just.. ''   `` Do n't be like that , man . I have n't done anything wrong , or anything crazy since my first level . I 'm just a simple developer at night , so I 'm just not good for conversation . ''   `` Okay . I think it 's time to run things over for a bit . ''   `` Yes , Sir . We 're going to work something out . ''   I walk outside to a cab , and rush home . I see people are running around , and ... I just get hit by some truck . I get a few moments to think . I drive over to the truck , and look at it . It is an emergency vehicle . There 's a set of coordinates , and I go to it . I place the coordinates on the dashboard , and start making a map .   `` Is the nearest city located ? '' I ask .   `` Oh yeah ! I 'm not a huge fan of this place . You 'll have to check your pockets . Or a bank account . ''   `` Oh wow ! No one here has anything.. ''   `` Okay , fine . Let 's see . ''   `` Alright , so , how hot is it ? ''   `` Um , 16500 degrees . ''   `` What ? ''   `` No way ! ''   `` Hmm , ok , that 's the temperature . ''   `` Really ? ! How hot is it ? ''   `` Um , 16500 degrees . ''   `` So it 's been doing this for *hours* ? ! Are you kidding me right now ? ! ''   `` What ? No..Yeah . I 'm freaking out . ''   `` Oh ? ''   `` Oh , shit . I ca n't believe it . ''   `` I said , seriously . This must be some kind of simulation ? ! ''   `` No..No , no , no . It 's just..it 's just . ''   `` Shut up . You 're going to wake up in a very weird place and your body hurts like hell for a long time , ok ? ''   `` Okay , uh , I 'm sorry . This is n't a simulation . ''   `` It 's just a simulation , '' she says . `` You have to get your mouth shut . Please ! ''   I open my mouth to scream , but it does n't open . I sit down by the window and pray . The sun is down and
`` It 's okay , honey . We have to stay with him . ''   `` You 're lying . He 's been diagnosed with cancer and is in a coma for weeks . ''   `` You do n't understand ! Look at him . He 's our baby . He 's our baby . We are n't supposed to be here ! We should n't have found out he 's so selfish ! ''   `` Honey , honey , I do n't fucking understand . If he had been diagnosed during his natural adult life , we would n't have found out ! Would n't we have gone out with him ? Or planned to have him be a friend ? ''   ( the subject is removed from the recording room )
`` It 's not even there anymore . It 's the only thing left . ''   `` What about it ? It 's our only communication network . Even if it keeps moving , the long distance is hard enough to keep it moving . ''   `` No one will talk to me about it . ''   `` Maybe . ''   `` We have enough food to last us for a few weeks at best , but for nothing . ''   `` Fine , fine . ''   `` There is nothing else to do then ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   ____________________________________   `` Well , it 's about time you reached the last match . ''   `` One match , please . ''   ____________________________________   `` Do they need to send a man down to the final match ? ''   `` Negative , they do n't . ''   ____________________________________   `` One match , please . ''   `` Negative , they will send one man down to the last match . ''   ____________________________________   `` I want to make sure our son is safe , but he 's dead . ''   `` It ca n't be , there is no point . ''   `` No , it can . ''   `` I wo n't be there .

''   ____________________________________   They both smiled as the ring became smaller with each passing second . They passed the final match over and over again , but their smile slowly faded .   At this moment , the ring began to glow a brighter orange .
We watched ourselves from the sky as we drifted down into the deep space and died .   We had just enough to make a home .   Because it was an eternity late .   The stars aligned with us , and we tried to make a home . And somehow all we found , was darkness .   Now we have found us , in God 's infinite void . And then there 's a light . It 's a dim red light shining down at us . It 's a ray of light . And it shines through the void like a beacon . And then ... the light moves inside her .   It 's a woman .   Her name is Leah . She 's a woman who 's been dead forever . She moved around the world in search of a bit of entertainment . And she 's found a fair amount of entertainment .   We watched ourselves die . And we watched ourselves die .   Then ... she came closer . And she held out to me . And when I let go , she pulled away . And she got bored . And she got bored . And she came closer and I let go again . And again and again . And again , and again . And again and again . And again . And still she pulled away . And then she came closer and I let go . And then ... I let go . And then I was left with a hole in my flesh .   At the end of the universe , Leah was still here . And I had always been there . She looked at me and smiled . She said `` Welcome home Leah . '' And said `` This is a paradise . '' I smiled back . She said `` And this is how Heaven works . '' And then ... we were n't in Heaven anymore .   The people here lived here , and there were a few more . You take a lot of the time to visit . And have a lot of time to think . And have fun . And time to think when you 're dead . And I have always wanted to visit . 
`` Hey James , '' I called as I walked down the park , `` What are you doing ? ''   `` I 'm helping a homeless man out . ''   `` What are you doing ? ''   `` And helping someone out . Do you see any cars you can take out ? ''   `` I 'm doing something in my car . ''   `` Do n't act like you do n't know what you 're doing , *James* . ''   `` I 'm helping someone out . ''   `` Can you help someone out ? ''   `` Yeah , I do . I 'm helping an elderly woman out . ''   `` What 's that ? ''   `` I 'm helping a homeless woman out . ''   `` It 's a little girl , '' I said , my voice cracking , `` what 's wrong with you ? Are you OK ? ''   `` No , no , no , I 'm fine . ''   `` That 's great ! What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` Well , I do n't know what to do , I do n't know what to do . Maybe if I let you speak , do you have any idea where I 've been ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Fine . ''   `` Okay , '' I said , smiling , `` What 's up ? ''   `` It 's a little girl , '' I said , my voice cracking , `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I 'm helping someone out . ''   `` Are you okay ? ''   `` No , I 'm ok . It 's a little girl , '' I said , my voice cracking , `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I 'm helping a homeless person out . ''   `` What are you doing ? ''   `` I 'm helping a woman out . ''   `` Are you OK ? ''   `` I 'm still OK. Maybe if I let you speak , do you have any idea where I 've been ? ''   `` It 's a little girl , '' I said , my voice cracking , `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I 'm doing something in my car . ''   `` Stop being such a dick , '' I said , my voice cracking , `` I just do n't know what to do . ''   `` Okay , '' I said , my voice cracking , `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I 'm OK. ''   `` Are you okay ? ''   I sighed , my voice cracking , `` I 'm sick of being such a dick . ''   `` No , you 're fine . I 'm sorry , James . I ca n't do it anymore . I love you forever . And all the bad things I 've done . ''   `` I love you too , James . ''
A flash . And then silence .   `` Sweetheart . You 're a hero , and you 're still a hero , but your parents are n't that happy . And they think , 'I am a hero ! ' and think that 's just what my momma 's always said , right ? But they do n't know that 's what I mean ! ''   My sweetheart stared at me blankly , the small hairs standing up on her chin . `` What does she mean ? ''   `` She means , 'I may not be so strong , but I am strong and good . And I am proud and happy and pretty . ' ''   She stared back , her eyes glinting in the bright sun . `` What about *my mommy* ? ''   `` She 's a good ol ' mommy . ''   My sweetheart nodded and smiled . `` That 's right , I 'm proud . I do n't know if that 's a lie or a good ol ' mommy . ''   I looked away . `` Look , honey , '' I said , wiping the tears from my eyes , `` sometimes ... sometimes you need to ask me something . ''   She looked away . `` What do you want ? ''   `` I do n't know . Maybe I want to play with my dad for a bit . But he 's not very smart and he can only use his imagination , so I have to ask him something . ''   `` So what if ... '' My sweetheart trailed off . `` I want to *live* ? ''   She nodded and took a step back , her eyes now scanning the ground . She tried to break my silence , but it was no use . `` Okay honey , '' she said , turning away and walking away .   I turned my attention back to my parents . `` Daddy , '' I said , looking at them with hopeful eyes , `` you 're the best I can be . ''   My wife looked at me curiously , her curly hair blowing in the wind .   `` Mommy ? ''   My wife smiled and shook her head . `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` I 'm sorry ? ''   Her eyes narrowed , and she looked away again .   I turned my attention back to my parents , still looking away from my wife . `` Mommy , '' I said , looking at my wife and my baby daughter , `` what would you think about her ? ''   My wife looked back at her daughter , eyes glinting in the bright sun . `` I think she is good . ''   I looked away , and for a moment , I thought about those three little words I 'd spent so long thinking .   I looked at my wife and her two children and looked back at me . `` I do n't know , '' I said , looking at my wife . `` But I think she would be a lovely wife . ''
The first thing you remember is waking up to a sharp pain in the back of your head . It was cold too . You shuddered . It was worse than you had ever felt before , almost too much .   You remember looking down and seeing a knife . Something was n't right though , something was n't right . It was n't a knife , it was n't a sword and it was n't even a blade .   Opening your eyes , you could see that there was someone else in the room . Your memory started to come back . An old man , with pale skin and hair that looked like it had been turned white .   `` Hi , '' he said , rubbing his knees . `` I 'm Peter , '' he said , holding out his hand . `` I 'm your murderer . ''   You felt a tug on your wrist . It was n't there , it did n't belong to you , it was n't your name . It was n't my name . And besides the fact that you were n't Peter anymore , it did n't belong to you .   `` W-who are you ? '' you stuttered . `` What 's going on ? ''   `` Are you ... are you not dead ? ''   `` No '' , you said . `` Just ... gone . ''   `` But why ? ''   `` I 'm not dead , '' he said . `` I 'm Peter . I 've killed thousands of people . I 've killed everything that I have ever loved . It 's all because of you . ''   `` I knew that . But why would I do it ? I have nothing left to lose . ''   `` Because you do n't know , '' he said . `` And you do n't care . ''   You felt your chest buckle and you fell to the floor . You did n't know what to say , you did n't know how to react . You did n't even know when you could even breathe . You did n't know when you could even sleep . You did n't know how long you could keep going while you was unconscious .   `` Why did you do that ? '' you asked .   `` Because I told you to not kill me . And you did n't . ''   `` Why did I do it ? '' he asked .   `` Because I wanted to . ''
The witch took two steps into the forest .   The forest was silent . It was cold . She took a deep breath to calm her spirits .   The man in front of her was tall . He was dressed in scraggly suit that covered much of her face . He looked at her .   She stared with wide eyes at him .   `` You do n't like her . '' Her voice was shaky . Her eyes were wide and her skin was pale . She looked around at the forest at the men , the women , and the trees .   The witch took a deep breath to calm her spirits .   `` She 's my sister . She 's too ugly to be called a sister . Her parents were n't as nice as they used to be . '' She lowered her voice .   `` You 're not my sister . '' The man placed his hand on her shoulder .   The witch did n't react . She just stared at him .   `` Then why are you scared ? ''   The man simply smiled at her .   `` Because you do n't know whether she would let you out and fight off her . '' He said .   The woman did not respond . She was starting to lose herself in the man 's voice .   The man put his hand at his chest .   `` I 'm sorry . ''   The woman looked at him again . Her eyes were big and angry .   `` I do love her too . '' The man said . `` But for the last time , I do n't think you love her , because she will never let me out and fight off her . ''   The woman sat still . She did n't say anything until she heard the man say something else .   `` She wo n't get married . '' The man said . `` She is n't my sister . ''   The witch sighed .   `` Then why do you want to do this , please ? '' She asked .   The man turned to look at her . He held out his hand to her .   `` Why do n't you go outside to tell her that you 're sorry . '' She said .   The man pulled the blanket up over her shoulders .   `` Why wo n't she find you ? Because you 're still a monster . '' He said .   The witch looked at him again .   `` Why wo n't she find you , because you 're still an animal . Because she needs you . '' The man said .   `` It 's pointless . '' The witch said . `` This is my life . ''   The man opened the door . He turned back towards her .   `` I wish I could stop you . ''
After ten years , it was time . The war had finally gone down . The troops were desperate , and could not take the opportunity to do battle . The war was over . The enemy was killed . His army had broken . The war had finally ended .   The doctor woke up . She looked around . He was in a hospital room . The doctors checked around the room . There were no signs of struggle . He did not know what to do . But he knew the answers : the war was over . He accepted his fate .   He got dressed . He did not want to leave the nurses . He wanted to go home to his wife and children . He stopped at the door . He asked the door for permission to open . He knocked . The door opened . He stood there with a nervous look on his face . He could not think of anything he missed . He had been in a coma for thirty years now .   The door finally opened . He looked around the room . There were no signs of struggle . He did not know what to do . But he knew the answers : the war was over . The war had finally ended . He accepted his fate .   She walked over to the hospital . She looked at him . She looked at him confused . She looked at him sadder than she normally does . She looked at him a bit more and said `` Hello '' .   The doctor got up with a start . He walked over to the empty bed where the nurse had been sleeping . He sat down . He looked through her eyes . He saw a tear forming on her forehead .   He hugged her .   `` Do n't worry '' .   He turned towards the dark void where nothing should be .   He woke up . It was time . Blood drained from his forehead . He looked around the room . There had been no struggle . He accepted his fate .
`` What the fuck are you doing ? ''   It could n't be much longer now , but it really was n't fair to me . My wife had tried to kill herself , and now I was stuck with this stranger . I felt bad for her , but I just could n't put my finger on it .   `` ... what the ... what the ... ... what the fuck ! ''   There was no stopping her , the lights turned off . I had only been on the train for eight hours , and I could n't even feel myself move .   `` What the ... what the fuck ! ''   I was still in shock after all this time , but I did n't have time to think , just as I saw a light flash .   There was light , and I saw him . He was wearing a black hoodie , and he was holding a gun .   I could feel my skin freeze , but something inside me refused to move . I was frozen , and I thought I was going crazy . People knew I was crazy , but they did n't know what I was .   I looked in his eyes , and saw a dark , fiery rage boiling , filling the air .   `` Tell me ! '' The man roared , and I grabbed him by the shirt .   There was nowhere for me to go . He was still holding the gun , as he was talking , with passion .   `` Tell me ! '' He shouted , and I grabbed him by the collar .   There was only one way out . The other one was through my window .   `` Stop ! '' I yelled .   The gunman shot me once . He could n't have been more than twenty , but he was so quick . I had to stop him , and I ran , crying .   When I turned the corner , there was red .   I sat there , frozen , as no one moved . In the darkness , I heard a girl scream behind me . I turned and saw that my husband was holding a gun .   `` Tell me ! ! '' The man yelled , and I grabbed his hand , and held him tight .   `` Tell me ! ! ''   And I stabbed him once again . I killed him once more , and now he is holding a gun .   `` Tell me ! ! ! ''   And I opened my eyes , and there was red . I saw it , and I tried to help him , but I was frozen as well . I felt my body go limp , and ... then ... I heard a voice , whispering in my head .   `` Tell me ! ! ! ! ''   And there was a light , and the woman was shaking .   I looked out at the street , and saw my husband was still outside .   `` Stop ! ! '' I yelled , and I saw him holding a gun .   `` Tell me ! ! ! ''   And I shot him once more , and he was holding a gun .   And there was light , and I saw him holding a gun .   `` Tell me ! ! ! ''   And I was still in shock , but I did n't have time to think , just as I saw a light flashes .

I 've been busy writing for five years now and have n't done my job properly , but I have been trying to stay afloat and continue to write . After a couple of years I 'm finally finished writing and it 's finally time to start writing .   I think I found my motivation once upon a time in high school when I could go on and on about my first day in this world . Even though I chose my country , I did n't know what to do about it . I decided to just start on a subreddit and write like a normal person . I am n't that good at being creative , but I guess it 's better that way . Hopefully some of my other friends on this subreddit will be able to see me doing it , so just try to save some time .   My writing motivation is completely different than I 've ever seen them doing . I write furiously and for the most part I have n't stopped writing . I 'm good at it and do n't waste any valuable information so I have no reason to waste my time on anything . However , I also tend to have the faintest sense of humor when I tell my stories . I 'm not supposed to waste time going on and on about my first day of this world , but instead I just sit patiently and try to write .   Today 's topic will be something I 'm currently working on but I was n't planning on continuing it until about two months ago . I think I 'm going to start writing by the next day . Usually I 'm gon na be back to my post for another few weeks and then this day will be here , I 've really got good ideas in mind .   I 'm gon na start writing on [ Inkitt ] ( http : //inkitt.com/ ) and keep going until I have enough for a week or so . I 'm gon na take notes for the day and then I 'm going to show my friends the next day of this world and they 'll probably believe this . This will probably bring them back to me some day .   I 'm taking notes for the day and that 's gon na do it . All I may have been able to do was write a few minutes and then I 'll be done .
`` What do you mean , *I* *can* *take* these wishes ? I am not making wishes , I honestly mean I 'm not even sure if I want to ! ''   The woman sighed . It was a simple statement , but it was true . Her eyes darted around the room . Not a single person had looked away . No one seemed distracted .   * '' Very well . You have made your wish , now tell me about it ! '' * The woman took the clipboard out of the room and handed it to the man sitting across from her . At him , the woman held out a hand .   `` No , no . ''   `` Are you serious ? '' The man said , turning to look at her . `` Are you crazy ? ''   `` I was wondering . ''   `` Are you a weirdo ? ''   The man blinked for a moment . He reached into the briefcase he was wearing and pulled out a small box . He walked over to the woman , put it on the seat next to the woman and sat down .   `` I am a stranger here . ''   `` I am *so* sorry . ''   `` I am . You should really get out of here quickly . You can call your father now , because we are about to discuss your new wish . ''   The man stared at her blankly . He pulled out a revolver from his jacket pocket and drew it from the box .   The woman looked up at him .   `` Yes , Mrs. Smith . I wish you would not have to do this . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Yes , Mrs. Smith . I wish you would not have to do this . You have made all your wishes , just as much as yours . ''   The woman lowered the gun to her temple and began to weep . Suddenly , a man walked up to her :   `` Your father , '' the man said . `` He did not want to give you these wishes . I was a stranger . I had a friend that liked to ride around in this town . I did not want to be a burden on him . ''   `` Oh , no ! '' The lady said . `` He was sick of me eating everything and giving me money and food . ''   `` I assure you , '' the man said , `` He is not as sick . He is hungry . ''   `` No ! '' The woman screamed . `` He is not as sick ! He is going to die ! ''   The man pulled out the long , black , stick out of his pocket and pulled out a paper . `` Please , Mrs. Smith , let me read my wish . ''   The woman sighed again , and turned to leave .   `` No , no , '' she said , turning to leave . `` I would rather you die than be here for this . ''   The man turned around , leaving her alone . `` What ? ''   `` I am sure your father would have never considered you interested in me ; I am too weak . ''   The man turned around and saw the woman sitting on a chair in front of him . He lifted her up and walked towards her .   `` I wish you would wait a moment longer , '' he said , `` For the gift to be yours . So to speak . ''   He pulled out a notebook from the pocket of his jacket , and flipped through the pages . `` How did you know about my gift ? ''   The woman nodded . On the page was a handwritten note .   `` Oh , yes , I know everything about you . It is the first act of all desires . ''   The man stared at the woman , and saw the blank , blank , blank expression on her face .   `` I can not let you live with my guilt ever again . ''   The woman made her way towards the door . The door slammed behind her .  
`` Now . ''   The two men sat in a small shack in Seoul , looking around at the city .   `` It was n't good at first . ''   `` Did you learn anything from that ? ''   `` Yes , but it did n't work out so well as I remembered . There was n't much to do , at first . But soon . ''   `` So , what do you hope to accomplish ? ''   `` I want to make sure everyone got their work . In my opinion , it might be the most lucrative job ever . Without it , the economy would n't work . ''   `` That sounds great ! ''   `` ... I do n't think I could do that . ''   The radio played an announcement from the Soviet Union .   `` Kimchi 's on his way to get his promotion ! ''   `` Good ! ''   `` He 's having a nice day ! ''   `` You too ! ''   The two women cheered .
As the years passed , the boredom grew . `` How long will I have to write this ? '' said the elderly man sitting at a loss for words . `` I do n't know . Does this have to do with a deadline ? ''   The young man glanced over at the young man . He knew he had to answer a few questions .   `` Yeah . I was just thinking how long it would take . '' The old man replied , then looked at the young man who had just finished reading the line . `` Maybe four hours . ''   `` So do you have to wait three hours for the bus ? '' the young man inquired .   `` Nope . '' The old man replied . `` It 's just so lonely . ''   The young man and the old man shared a hearty laugh , and watched the bus go on .     As they passed the corner out into a small plain , the old man gazed up at the sky .   `` Do you have to wait three hours for the bus ? ''
I 'd been working , on this day . I 'd picked a new option ( or atleast what the hell I 'd choose to choose ) , and I was just ready to go . The only thing that worried me was how well I 'd done .   It took me about a hundred tries , but eventually I decided I 'd rather just go one way or the other . I had to choose something else . I was still awake , but I could still feel my body floating around me . It was n't until I woke up that I 'd been sure about this .   It was a few minutes early . I would n't have expected any more work today . I was almost out of food , only 15 minutes before I 'd get to the office .   *Beep*   *Beep*   I picked up the phone . `` Hello Mr. President . It 's time for your daily briefing . We have a situation that needs your approval . '' A moment later , the line rang . `` I 'm sorry , but I ca n't do this . I 'm still in my final days of service . ''   `` Mr. President , listen . We need to talk . You 're going to say the following thing , and we need to warn you of our impending doom . You 'll have to ask what 's under your control , and what we 're missing . ''   `` I do n't know , Mr. President . I do n't think this could have happened any other way . I 'm scared by what you 'll say . ''   `` Mr. President , if I can choose to continue living my life , I know that we ca n't do it . But you understand this . You 'll have to be the next President of the United States . ''   `` Mr . president , you 're going to lose the election . You 're going to lose the job . You 'll only lose a few more years to the American peoples wars . You 'll be running out of time . ''   `` Mr. President , if I can choose to stay in this office , I want to win . I just want to die . I want to spend the rest of my days in peace . ''   `` Mr. President , if there 's anything you regret , I want to get that power . I want to be able to do anything for one person . Anything that will earn you something that will make you stronger than the next President . ''   No . I had to do this , I had to be the next president of the world . I had to do this . I only had to be the next king .   `` Mr. President , please . I do n't want to be the next President of the world . I do n't want to live my life in peace . ''   `` Mr. President , please . Mr. President , you know that -- ''   `` Mr. President , please . ''   `` He 's right , Jim . If you could do what we can , we 'd give you everything you could ever want . ''   ...   *Click*   `` Your time has come , Mr. President . ''   - - - - - -   *Click*   As I pressed the button , the room was filled with the familiar hum of a machine . I grabbed my pillow and went to sleep . It was more than five minutes before my eyes were open .   I awoke at twelve , in the middle of the day .   I stared at the blank machine that hung from my ceiling , confused . My eyes widened . It was a machine , identical to a desk in his office . Its surface was covered in thin , dark lines , and it had several beacons on either end . I sat up , startled by the sudden appearance of the beacons .   I looked at the beacons standing in front of me .   *They were stars ? * I thought , staring at them .   I ran downstairs and found myself in the middle of the night .   *Can someone see me ? Is this a dream ? Is this some kind of sick prank ? * I thought . *I probably should n't had those beacons . *   As I stared at the screens , a light bulb lit up the room . Just before it began to glow , he grabbed my hand .   `` Come on , Jim , do n't you dare go outside . You 'll probably die
`` ... and it 'll hit you like a car wreck every time ''   I turned to my right to see her sitting behind her , smoking a cigarette . `` I swear to god I 'll never be more wrong ''   `` You 're kidding . You wo n't get out of this alive ''   We 'd been silent for a long time since the cancer had set in , but she had n't spoken a word , just stared at me with a blank stare .   Well , not really a blank stare . There were things that she had n't said a word . Things that I thought would never be said . Things that would never bring her joy . Things that would n't bring her sadness . Things that would never let her see it . Things that would never bring her joy either ''   `` I am ''   She took a long drag , but the next morning she disappeared and I was alone .   I slowly emerged from the closet to find my father was gone . The gun I 'd bought for him earlier in the day was gone and that day I started smoking .
The night seemed to have almost completely vanished , no stars in the sky , no people around me . I lay here pondered for a few moments on what to do with myself right now , never letting myself ask myself what I would become if something happened . I was still thinking , I just needed to know if I could help someone , let everyone else try to stop me . I remember one day , some girl asked me who I was and I told her I was a computer geek . The woman I had been texting and I responded that I was Google Chrome users . She thanked me and went on to find out about my background and my interests , it was about my interests that I found the most interesting . I started to search the internet , everyone started to reply to me , they liked me so much , I could n't hide it . They gave me a really long and great list and told me to leave .   As I left I tried to focus on my life and move forward , they started to get jealous , they had that person that loved me so much that I did n't want to give it away . It was then that I realized , I was going to go on to do something awesome , something that I could n't do without her . I started working in the same building that I had worked at the same time , I started working at the same time and began working , I was a computer geek . I started to realize that I was going to change my life , for no matter what I did I was going to save everyone else 's lives . I was never really good at it and I started thinking about what I could do if I tried to save others ' lives . I saw the potential and realized that I would become a better person and that all people could have a good reason for being , I thought that I would become better person because I could help them improve . I became a better person because I could help them have a good reason for the good reason .   This is why I decided to join the reddit community .
The dirt beneath his feet was thick . He sighed and forced a hard breath . It was early in the morning and his old friend was working . He thought of a new band . It was a nice tune . He picked it up , and as he turned it to face the army , he saw it . A group of boys , laughing loudly , moving towards the ground . A small group of them , all wearing the same uniform .   They were being pushed to the ground by the army . It was too late . The men had beaten them down , and the soldiers were taken out . He fell to his knees , crying . He cried and cried . Then he heard the gunshots .   He saw the men march towards him . A single bullet made contact with the face of the enemy . His vision went black as he got up from his knees . He turned around one last time and saw he was in his 20 's again . He had n't seen his friend before . As he looked at his friend , he recognised him . He 'd always known him . He 'd been one of the first to be brought to the hospital . And now he was alone at home , with his grandchildren and grandkids .   He walked slowly towards the group of boys . He felt their tears . As he stepped closer , he saw the same man . Not a father , but a son . A father , dressed in plain military attire , with his eyes closed . Two men approached him . He saw the same man , dressed in plain military attire , and smiled .   `` Do n't fight ! Do n't fight ! I told you to do it ! '' The father said .   `` Thank you , Dad , '' the boy replied , with a smile .   The father got up from his crouching position , and spoke in a voice that sounded very sad .   `` The war is over , Dad . My world is gone and you have lived for ten more years . Did you not see my grandchildren ? Tell me , did you not see them ? ''   The son started to shake his head and turn towards the father .   `` They wo n't know what happened . I 'll tell them . I 'll tell them everything . ''   The son turned and left the room . His son put his head down and stared at the portrait of his grandchildren . He turned around once again and said in a gravelly voice .   `` I love you Dad . I 'll keep you company . ''   *****  If you liked this , check out /r/Picklestasteg00d for more !
I ca n't sleep now . I need to get up . My bed is dirty from the constant dampness of the day . It 's been 6 weeks since I 've slept .   Last night , I woke up to the smell of hamburgers . I was in a state of panic that I should n't have noticed . I rushed to my closet to find that same smell . I opened the closet door , and it was empty . I heard a clang and a smacking noise .   `` Ugh , oh fuck , my stomach . I 'm so hungry . What the hell ? '' I thought .   I got up and looked around . Well , I do n't know how , but I 'm at work . I walked home , and I grabbed the keys I put in my car . And saw that I was holding the key to unlock a locked door .   I walked in and turned the key . But I was n't in my car . I was at my desk . I looked at my boss .   `` Hey Jim , just got a new key . Can I get it for you ? ''   Jim .   ***   I have to get up . I want to know why my boss is missing .   I walked to my closet . I found my clothes , my bag , my cell phone , and my clothes . I open it . I see that Jim is right behind me .   `` Hey Jim . Got a new key . Can I get it for you ? ''   Jim .   ***   I was stuck between 3 different people for 8 hours . I saw another person walking by . I saw another person coming by next door .   `` Hey Jim , got a new key . Can I get it for you ? ''   Jim .   ***   I could barely move . I tried to get up but to nothing . But I could n't . I kept trying to think of what my boss wanted . I could n't . I laid there for a few more hours just staring at my phone .   I ca n't sleep now .
I sit on my patio chair and look out over the sea of trees . My girlfriend and I are just getting ready for the evening , and it ’ s a good feeling that we ’ ve finished up .   As we walk the water is filling my lungs and I wonder if she ’ ll see me tomorrow . She doesn ’ t acknowledge me as the way I am , she just sits there and stares at the water through the window .   Every morning I wake up and go downstairs to a little coffee shop and wait , but since I ’ ve been at work I don ’ t think I need to talk much . I go into work and still have nightmares about the past few days .   Being too lazy can be so stressful . So I spend our days working harder , sometimes I just let myself take a couple days off . Maybe if I ’ m not going to get on the weekends soon , I ’ ll go back home and spend the rest of my days in the fields again .   I wake up and try to pretend I ’ m gone and my mind is playing tricks on me . I sit up and start running my fingers over my hair . It keeps getting thicker and thicker until it is almost black . I begin to walk back to my car and drive . I watch my girlfriend , so long as she doesn ’ t look at me . I then stop at a little crosscut , and get going right into the forest .   I start running again , but this time my feet are on gravel and I can feel my back getting stiff . I reach the crosscut where every tree line is starting to grow out . I see it now . It ’ s just massive . I can see its length . It has a face that looks like it is built for a person . It is small , like a potato but with teeth that open to swallow something alive , and has a face that looks quite similar to a dog .   The giant has six eyes and is so big that it looks like it has eight ears . It has a mouth that opens at a point and closes at the same time . Then it gets very , very wet and starts moving towards me . I try to run down but I ’ m trapped and I ’ m trapped .   I start yelling , and I can ’ t help but feel bad for the big . I run out of the animal parts and finally make it in front of my girlfriend ’ s house . She has two hands and she ’ s crying . She turns around and points at me and says , “ Where are you , sweetheart ? ”   I nod . 
The tree was a simple thing . A simple tree . It was the gift of the gods to create a life in the universe . If someone were to die . If one were to get caught . If you were to be saved . If you were to be saved .   As I grew older I learned why I keep bringing it to my old friend 's grave . It was a relic within me . A reminder of our past , our past , the past . The tree was there to remind me of how I had lost my body . I lost all those memories of the past and the present . It was the only thing that made me feel better .   I took the tree , and took my time building my new life . It was a slow fall . It soon became a slow fall . The tree was n't so bad . In the beginning I was happy , but as my friends became closer together , it became a hard fall . As my friends became closer , my family became closer to me . I started to notice bigger , more tree , the bigger tree , and until finally , I became a tree .   I began planning , crafting , and teaching , until one day , I made a mistake . I thought that the tree is making me as better than I made of it . I thought that I was killing myself , and that I was being selfish and selfish .   So I decided to give it up when I found out that I had never been quite as happy as I had been . I decided to make another mistake . When I was released from his prison , I placed a rock that was shaped like a tree .   It was carved by a man . He said that it would change my life forever . I left the tree , and after a few years it grew quite large .   This was truly amazing . I was finally a tree .
I was in a hospital room , a young man and his wife waiting for us . He was in a wheelchair , and they were holding his son , William , by his side . He was there , but for the most part , he was looking through his eyes .   They both had large black eyes , which seemed to be scanning through our minds as if they were looking for something . I wished I could see them , but it was hard to , because I could not see anything . At first , I felt nauseous , with the feeling of being alone . Then , I realized that I was standing on top of a huge hospital bed , and had a massive , black robe around my body .   I looked around for a minute , but found nothing .   `` So , '' I began , `` if this is how you feel ? ''   The hooded figure smiled crookedly , his face wrinkled from years of smoking .   `` Well , '' I stated , `` I suppose it 's time to go . I 've come for you , too . ''   The hooded figure 's hood extended down , revealing his white uniform . I noticed that there were no pants on his body , nor a shirt on his head . He had white hands , and a black vest . The only difference was that he had no hair . I was afraid , because I knew nothing about death as much as he did .   `` I 'll be in touch , '' he said , as he reached for a briefcase before closing the suitcase .   `` Goodbye , William , '' I said .   He gave me a slight nod , before going into the car . `` Goodbye , William . ''   `` Goodbye , William . ''   I walked away , and I was left alone .
“ Let ’ s play some fun , man , ” said Doctor Shrek , watching from across the table from Dr. Seuss .   The three sat in a circle , watching the contestants play . Dr. Seuss gave the Doctor a hard stare , then slowly nodded . “ Let ’ s get this over with , shall we ? ”   The Doctor let out a sigh of relief ; he was a great magician . He ’ d played a good number of tricks , and never lost a single penny . He put out a hand to shake , but the Doctor grabbed it and shook it . The three began to settle down , leaving only the Doctor , and the Doctor who was in the other side of the table .   “ Let ’ s see… ” he started , “ What do you mean you won ? ”   The Doctor nodded once more . “ I won everything , from the sea to the oceans . But nothing ’ s good . And yet there I am , in my chamber , looking out at the stars ! ”   “ Wow ! You ’ re such a great magician , Doctor Seuss . I should have known you ’ d be going at it. ” The Doctor laughed . “ Because you think you can make it , right ? ” Doctor Seuss looked away .   “ I mean , I really. ” The Doctor nodded .   “ You do realize that ? It ’ s amazing this time around ! It ’ s really , really amazing. ” With that , he began to go at it , his way to the front .   “ Great , ” said Dr. Seuss , “ So what do you think ? ”   “ The universe should be better off without you , isn ’ t it ? ”   “ No , Doctor Seuss . I don ’ t think so . I mean , I want to see the universe and go there , but that wouldn ’ t happen if I could do it ! I think it ’ s better out here than on this mortal hole . Maybe there ’ s some hope that there ’ s not . Maybe the universe ’ s better off without the man you ’ ve become. ”   “ I guess we ’ ll see , ” asked Doctor Seuss , looking down at his table . “ Why do you think it would be better if you could help us ? What are you thinking , Doctor ? ”   “ I mean , it would certainly be better if I could help you , would it ? ”   “ I guess so , ” replied Doctor Seuss , looking back at his face . “ But I really think that we are going to need you. ”   “ Well , you may not be able to stay with me anytime soon , ” continued Doctor Seuss . “ But if you can stay with me forever , I can help you find peace . Now , I ’ ve never hurt anyone before . I do hope things go well , though. ”   Dr. Seuss walked back to his table , and sat himself down . “ So , if you ’ re going to stay with me forever , do you want to say goodbye ? ”   “ I ’ m sorry ? ”   “ I… I need to say goodbye… goodbye . Goodbye , Doctor Seuss. ”   “ Are you going to stay with us forever or not ? ”   The Doctor didn ’ t seem to care . He grabbed his cane , and began to walk towards the door . 
`` Hey Jack . '' I heard my voice say .   I was n't used to this voice , but it was nice to hear it . It was n't like it existed , not like I was alone . Jack 's smile was infectious , I could see the droplets in his eyes .   `` Sorry about that , '' I said . `` I kinda lost it a few minutes ago . ''   Jack grinned . He had big , yellow teeth , but I could tell him his teeth were white . He seemed a little upset that I had lost him .   `` Listen , '' I started , but Jack just shook his head . `` In this life we have only lived for one day . On one day , you 're the first human to clone us . ''   The two of us shared a look , and I knew we were the first to get wiped out . `` Okay , '' I began . `` But who *would* have thought that one day we would get the first human person to clone ourselves ? ''   He smiled . `` Most the world do . ''   `` Where is Jack ? '' I asked .   `` He 's back at the lab . ''   I walked over to the exit .   `` What is it all about ? '' I asked .   `` It all started , '' Jack said , looking at me . `` Everyone says you 're always special . I guess they should . ''   `` To be honest , '' I started , `` I miss the way you look at yourself and feel like you 're unique . I 've been watching you for years . I missed the way you smile . ''   Jack laughed . `` I wanted to see you grow up ! ''   `` Is that so ? ''   `` Yeah . '' He looked down at the ground , and looked up at me . `` When has it been this long ? ''   `` Two lifetimes . '' I said .   `` So you 're still alive today ? '' Jack asked .   I nodded . `` Sure is . ''   `` So my name 's Jack , '' I said . `` I 'm just Jack . ''   Jack shrugged . `` I guess you 're ready for it . ''   I looked down at my hands . I could see that they were pink . I closed my eyes and put them back up .   `` Fine , I 'll go . '' I said . `` Just call it a day . ''
`` They said that you had to be careful , did n't you ? '' she asked , raising an eyebrow at the driver 's seat .   `` Hush , '' the man responded , stroking his beard . `` It 's safe to say that this is the first time I 've seen a ghost walk through my window . ''   `` Yes , '' She said , her head resting against the lapel of her skirt tighter than a pin . `` Is n't that what you want to hear ? ''   The driver shrugged . `` There 's no telling , there 's nothing , and I 'm sure that 's all that matters . ''   `` You do n't know how much we can do , '' she spat . `` We need to get back to civilization , not kill another one of them . ''   `` I think we can , '' he shrugged . `` We may not succeed . This is that land , and I do n't know if we can ever be sure that everything starts again . ''   `` Then I will die , '' Jane said . `` There 's no point in trying to stop them . They 're the bad guys . ''   `` Then that is what you need to know , '' he said , reaching for his jacket . `` I like it . We 've been hunting them for a while , and I think we can find something that 's working , at least until we get back to civilization . ''   Jane nodded . `` Just say it , '' she said , and he shook her head . `` I 'll help you , alright ? '' she asked , putting a hand on his shoulder to reassure him that he was safe .   `` I am , '' he said , a smile forming on his face . `` I am going to die . ''
The crowd erupted in a mix of cheers and cries . It was an unprecedented feat , never before seen . It was an incredible world record .   No one knew where it came from or it even existed . We do n't understand why , nor even how it came into existence . No one has yet used the words `` Time Machine '' over 300 years ago .   At 16 , a man with a black beard and dark red hair stumbled into the room . Not knowing what to do , he collapsed to his knees on the table . His eyes opened wide and his mouth fell open .   `` I just could n't finish my last meal ! `` , he exclaimed .   `` No , no , no , no you have not completed your last meal ! `` , cried the second man .   `` Why are you crying , '' said the third man .   `` You are a machine . You are a machine that can create itself . You are , one day , the most powerful , most beautiful machine in the world . But you did not find a proper way to master yourself . You did not find the correct way to create a perfect machine . ''   He stared at his hands , and looked around the room . He gazed to the wall , at the television , at the door , at the kitchen .   `` I just wanted a simple cut , a simple cut , '' he said , unable to comprehend .   `` I do n't understand . What is this difference between me and your machine ? ''   `` Your machine , your machine , '' he said .   Nothing was said .
It is n't often that I am able to communicate with the opposite worlds . It begins a while ago , when I was younger , or perhaps older , or perhaps older . As I grew , it became more difficult to communicate with the real world . The reality starts to grow more serious , though .   I discovered a connection that I had not in many years . I had first noticed it when I was young . I did not think much about it until the day I was six . Then I began to notice things that I should n't have . These things that were not happening to me . Had I been hiding behind a window at the moment , or behind a building , I would have noticed them .   I was afraid . After finding out , I began to realize that being able to communicate with a wall would be extremely uncomfortable . I began to wonder if the other worlds could recognize me . My curiosity was piqued , as the alternate realities began to appear on the other side of the mirrored planet .   I would never be able to communicate with them .   What I discovered was that I did n't know how much time I had . I was too dumbfounded to understand what was happening to me to notice it . I would be stuck in a mirror in my room for the rest of my life , with seemingly no light or meaning in my world . I would always need to change clothes each day for the purpose of changing things around me . I did not need my clothes to continue the same way in my life .   Of course , I had a lot of fun .   Since then , I have tried to achieve my dreams . I have taken up the challenge of starting the world but have never achieved anything . When I first started , I did not have much success . I started to have problems creating things I could barely get rid of . I have tried to change myself everyday , but the problem was that I had nothing to do . It seems that I was not able to create either . The solution is to change my world .
“ There ’ s an old woman ’ s home downtown , probably no older than 50 . She has these weird devices that sort of control stuff , like the ones you can ’ t tell you until you ’ re too close to the train. ”   “ Have you ever been to a place where someone tells you they can ’ t see people ? ”   “ I ’ ve never seen someone walk past me , not even in crowds. ”   “ Well , for most people , that ’ s because they can ’ t see someone , like even in a crowd , so we ’ re usually pretty safe , right ? ”   “ Is that so ? ”   “ I ’ m not sure ... ”
`` I just did n't make it . ''   The man sat on the edge of the bed , looking down the window like he had just done a game . It was a shame that he had n't come to terms with his loss . All those people he would n't see again , those people who still loved him .   He remembered the nights when he had his back to the window , knowing that what it was like would n't matter anymore , and everyone was just angry at him . He was different . He could walk on the street . He could laugh .   `` I was your father , dad . I was just an opportunity for you to meet some people who will respect you , dad . ''   And yet , now , like any other day , he realized what it was like to say it .   `` My mother is a hard work mother , and I love her dearly . She 's always asking me to be with her for hours every night , wishing that I could join her . I do n't want to talk about it , but she loves me more than anything in the world . ''   And still , like any other day , he understood the feeling .   `` I 'm a good father . I 've stayed with her for days , trying to be with her more than anything in the world . She 's always begging a favor she can not . I was hoping it would be enough . I really did n't . ''   He smiled , staring at the window again to keep his eyes fixed on the figure outside .   `` I understand , son . You know that sometimes you ca n't be with your mother , but you know that you should be with your father . ''
I walked down the field towards the massive gates . They had been abandoned by angels , no more than a few hundred years ago . My own children had died in their beds years ago , and my wife was in agony .   The gates were filled with millions of souls . I could almost taste the flesh of the souls within . Each one had their own unique soul , each one unique and unique , each one unique .   I could see a great gate as well as an endless field of demons and angels . I could see the earth and sky with light shining through . I could see two men with spears outstretched , and a tall man with sharp teeth , with green skin . But they were all different . They all was a lot more beautiful than I imagined .   `` Hello , '' I said .   `` Hi , '' one of the demons said .   `` Hm . Hi . Hi , '' I said again .   `` There 's more to this , '' the demon said .   `` Who are you ? '' I asked in horror .   `` You know , '' the demon replied .   `` Who are you and why do you look so- ''   `` I do n't know , '' I said .   `` I do n't know who you are , '' the taller demon said .   `` I do n't know , there 's always something I do n't know , '' I said .   `` Let 's get to it , '' the demon said .   `` Okay , I 've got one thing for you . You ca n't come to that gate forever . ''   The demon grinned .   `` Fine , '' he said .   I got as far as I could out of that gate .   I pulled the demons along , and threw them away .   `` What are you doing here ? '' I asked .   `` I 'm taking human form , '' the one on the left said .   `` Why are you taking me ? ''   `` I 'm taking you to Heaven and the afterlife , '' the one on the right said .   `` What have you done to me , you mean ? ''   `` Just like the humans , '' the demon said .   `` How long have I been here ? ''   `` About a millennia . ''   `` Can you tell me where I am and what 's going on ? ''   `` How long do you think I can stay here ? ''   `` Two billion years , '' the one on the left said .   I looked around and saw darkness .   `` Can you tell me what 's going on ? ''   `` You 're going to go to Hell , '' the one on the left said .   `` Why are you forcing me to go then ? ''   `` Because there 's a good reason for me to stay here , '' the demon said .   `` What is Heaven ? ''   `` Heaven , '' the one on the left said .   `` I 'm going to go to Hell , '' the one on the front said .   `` Why ? '' I asked .   `` Because you 're taking my life , '' the demon said .   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I 'm not going to either Heaven or Hell , '' the demon said .   `` Then what ? ''   `` I 'm going to go to Heaven and the afterlife , '' the demon wrote on the black wall .   `` How do you know that ? ''   `` I 've been taking human form many thousands of years , '' the demon wrote on the black wall .   `` Why 's that ? ''   `` You 're taking your life , '' the one on the left said .   `` Why is that ? ''   The demon sighed .   `` Because you 're taking my life , '' the one on the left said .   `` Why does n't that give you a second chance ? ''   `` Because it does n't gives you a second chance , '' the one on the right said .   `` Why does n't that give you a second chance ? ''   `` Because it does n't give a
The dark tunnel gave people the opportunity to be unique . The kids had tried their best to get to the middle of the tunnel , but it was impossible : there was a whole lot waiting for them at the end . Many of them had died , taken , lost , or , perhaps , had their own families . Overpopulation was the issue .   Every year , a child would be brought in , and then they would turn fourteen years old . The children would be put in the same room , placed into the same chair again , and then they would be told to put them in the same space again .   `` As I said before , '' I said , trying to sound reassuring , `` this does n't look like anything we 've ever tried . ''   `` There 's probably something wrong with this . ''   `` It 's a bit too cold out here . ''   Outside of the tunnel , the children were going to school , and they were told to explore . `` Come on , '' I said , smiling . `` We can go through , and we wo n't be alone . We 'll get used to it . ''   We walked slowly through . The tunnel was silent , save for a few birdsong , and a few people buzzing around . We approached the end of the tunnel .   `` There 's an opening , '' I said .   The kids ran out of the tunnel . I could see one of the windows open . I saw a large , black , wall standing out . There I saw the entrance .   `` What the hell is this ? '' I said .   The door opened . The children rushed in , screaming and running . I saw a man in a robes standing a few feet behind them . He looked at me with frightened eyes .   `` How the Christ ... '' he whispered .   `` He 's probably a friend of mine . ''   The man threw the robe at me , leaving me standing in the middle of him . For a moment , I thought about what the heck I had done . I had been sentenced for a life sentence , and I was going to end up in prison for it .   But what if I had not seen the man ? What if , after one day , I had seen his face ? What if , in one of the tunnels , I heard him say through another mouth ? What if , against all odds , I had not heard what he said .   I stood up , leaving the darkness behind me . I took a deep breath . I felt like I was going through the deepest part of the darkness .   I fell onto the ground , a piece of charcoal burning away at my eyes . I felt warmth spreading down my body . I saw a light , as if a spotlight was shining through my body .   `` What ... What happened ? '' I said .   `` We 're back in camp . ''
The cell at the end of the block was smaller than I originally imagined . There were a dozen men , each brought into the room by a rather strict rope . On the wall above the cell were another dozen inmates , and one prisoner who was slightly older than the others .   Each prisoner had a cell , a table , a window , and a small camera resting on its wall . On the table was a wooden stool , with a large oak handle attached to it . In the center was a wooden chair with several small logs sticking out . A large man stood there , probably in his mid thirties , with a pistol in both his hands . He wore a long white coat with a white blazer , and a tie with a purple duster . He had a white fedora with a white cotton bow draped over his head .   `` Just a little more , '' he said . `` I would like to thank you . ''   `` Just a little more , '' I replied . `` I would love to thank you . ''   `` Just a little more , '' he said .   I raised the pistol , but the barrel went through his chest . He fell instantly , and the other one fell again . The man next to me was a young boy , with bright brown hair and large dark blue eyes . He looked back to me , and I saw that his eyes were wide open . After a few moments , he regained his composure .   `` I had good news , '' he said . `` We would like to thank you for being able to do this for us . ''   I looked up at him .   `` Well , I hope you 'll enjoy it , '' he said .   `` I did n't know you were a doctor . ''   `` No , no , no , no . ''   `` What about anything else ? ''   `` I am a doctor . I can bring you information that we can cure any diseases , including cancer , or any other disease , that affect your future . It will help you in your future . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` Nothing . Let me ask you a simple question . ''   `` Really ? ''   `` Have you been to anywhere ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Have you watched television ? ''   `` No . ''   `` That is what the news said . They say that you were kidnapped by an evil supernatural entity , and killed for killing . ''   `` What ? ''   `` You gave up hope . ''   `` I gave up hope ? ''   `` No . ''   `` What about your parents ? ''   `` No . ''   `` What about my neighbors ? ''   `` No . ''   `` I would miss them , but they would always be there for me . ''   `` Then you can leave ? ''   `` No . ''   `` No . ''   `` Why did you give up hope ? ''   `` Why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was the only outcome . ''   `` But why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was the only outcome . ''   `` And what about my friends ? ''   `` They would always be there for me . I would always be there for them . ''   `` Why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was the only outcome . ''   `` Why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was because it was the only outcome . ''   `` Why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was the only outcome . ''   `` I could n't do anything ! ''   `` Why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was the only outcome . ''   `` Why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was the only outcome . ''   `` Why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was the ONLY outcome . ''   `` Why did you kill me ? ''   `` Because it was the only outcome . ''   `` Why , why ? ''   `` Because it was the only outcome . ''   `` Why ? ''   ``
Once you find this , you will know how I feel . The realization of the guilt is overwhelming . I would rather be dead than living on a beach in the middle of nowhere , surrounded by the dead . So ... I had a plan . I would die , and live .   By the time I got to this point I was already in the middle of nowhere . The only thing I could think of was going to kill myself . My life would work out , I would have a normal life , go peacefully , no regrets . I would become normal .   It would be so easy , but the more likely scenario was I would have to go to the hospital , pull what little hope I could . And then I would go to my usual place . I would just follow the directions I usually get . I would go to the lobby , and , just as I was about to close the door , I heard the news .   `` There are approximately five hundred of you alive today . Two thousand of you have been successfully killed , and they all have been placed into stasis . Please respond to any and all questions you have before you go . ''   I had no idea what to do with my life . But it would be so easy to move . I spent the better part of the day playing video games , with friends not watching , laughing , and even hugging .   Every now and then some random guy would step onto a boat , and I would jump . I would jump on top of it . Then , in the blink of an eye , I would dive to the bottom of the water . I would go through the motions I usually do , and then I would dive into it again .   Finally , I would die . To live . That is all . My final note was :   `` It was always nice to meet you , and I hope you enjoyed your life . ''
The first thing you notice are the smells . The scent of gasoline . The scent of burning flesh . It stinks worse than a burning body . And it smells ... ..boring . The fear only lasts just a little bit more , and you start to get worried . You 're not prepared for this ; you 're not prepared for what 's to come . You start to feel sick . You 're confused and afraid for your life . You start to think about what to do next . You look up to see the house across the street begin to burn . You see those people gathered in front of the house and all are shouting to each other about the fire . You look down to see the flames surrounding the yard suddenly dissipating as the house lights come on . You 're scared . You 're scared of what 's to come . You 're scared of what may happen if you do n't change . There 's nothing you can do .   You 're afraid of what 's to come . You 're afraid of the worst . You 're terrified of the worst . You 're terrified of what might happen if you do n't change . You 're afraid of what may happen if you do n't stop . You 're afraid of the worst . You 're afraid of what might happen if you do n't change .   The day he came , you could hear the screaming from across the street . It is n't far behind . You look around at the empty house . You see a group of people gathered around a fire . They do n't seem concerned about what you 're doing . They do n't even bother to look at you . They just gaze at you . They 're almost there . You do n't worry about anything , just stare at them . They look at you . You do n't notice anything . You know what to do . The house light is on . You think about what you 're doing after what you 've witnessed . You think about what you 've done to deserve this . You think About what may happen if you do not change . You do n't notice that the people around you begin to whisper to you , whispering softly . You 're afraid to talk to them , to even talk . You 're afraid of what may happen if you do n't change . You 're terrified of what may happen if you do n't stop .   This is getting worse . You are afraid of what may happen if you do n't do change . Your fear is increasing . There 's nothing you can do . You have n't changed . You have n't changed in almost a year . You 've lost hope .   The second thing you notice is the smell . The smell of burning flesh . The smell of burning flesh . It stinks worse than a burning body . The smell of burning flesh .
It 's not like he minded though , he just enjoyed the good parts of it . The evil part , like the time at McDonalds the owner made the place offer a nice and well prepared for the sale the customer was promised and the food was n't exactly bad . But that was a bit of a shock , he was still drunk when he first bought it , so he was also drunk when he bought everything .   He had a theory , this has never happened before , especially not in his normal life , but it was starting to get on him , this was n't the first time this had happened to him . It had never happened before , and it was kind of odd to say the least .   He began to see the familiar pattern in the patterns of the patterns , each one different and different , until he knew they were where he needed them to be . He started to learn they were where he needed them to be , and he realized he had no idea why .   The other man stood in a line , he was n't really a regular guy , he was a regular person , not a particularly important person , he had to be alone . He had other friends , and they were all from years of practice . It did n't matter , they were all the same , they were all the same , but they were all the same .   Once the circle was complete , he had a new , better friend . He was n't the best friend of his people , but he felt as though they were the same , and now that the circle was complete , he had a new friend .   He started moving , but he was n't completely sure how and when , and he should probably explain to them or something , but as he moved he realized that he could do something different . He moved his arms , and he was all the same , but a new friend of his people was in front of him , they all seemed to be the same .   This time , he moved his hands again , and it was n't the same . He moved them more , and he was more , more , more , more , more , more , more , and each time , it faded , and the man in the next line , this time , was the one who changed , and he moved his arms again .   And soon he was a new friend . His new friends were all the same , and he was the best at everything , but everything else was different . He could n't control the movements of his arms , but he knew that when he moved his arms , they were the same , and each time , he could control the movement of his arms , and every time , he could control the movement of his arms .   Finally , he had changed .
The Great One ( or so I hoped ) took a moment to admire the mountain before snapping his fingers . It was covered in vines and roots that seemed to twist and turn in the wind , somehow in a manner that seemed like they could be called a tornado . His finger twitched around the crown of the mountain until he spotted a large , black-scaled bear growing near where the crown rested , making a noise as it tilted , allowing it to be seen through layers of branches and branches .   It was the first time I had seen them since the Great One . They had stood a few miles from the mountain and gazed upon the land . The tallest of the tree-capes was wearing leather armour , with a large sword on his hip . He stood at least a 20 foot tall , with a short-sword and a large shield on his back .   `` Hello , '' he exclaimed . `` Your name is Tom , is n't it ? ''   I nodded . `` I 'm Tom . ''   The enormous beast tilted and then looked at the giant , his huge eyes full of wonder .   `` I have come to slay you , '' he said . He spoke in a lower voice . `` To slay you . ''   I nodded . `` Yes . Yes . ''   `` If you dare make a sound , you shall be killed . ''   `` I can not . ''   The giant leaned forward and revealed a long , black beard . He stared at me .   `` You wish to slay me ? ''   `` I wish to . ''   He folded his arms , and then stared into the distance . I turned across my feet and pointed at the mountain .   `` Why not ? '' I asked . `` Why ? ''   The giant bent on the ground , and then tilted his head back until he lay on his back . His hand , at the foot of my chest , was still held by a large , black-scaled sword .   `` What is it that you wish to slay ? '' I asked . `` Why are you a monster ? ''   He tilted his head back and stared into the distance .   `` Please , do n't let me kill you . ''   The giant tilted his head back and gazed at me .   `` Will you stop hurting me ? '' I asked .   `` But ... you 've never hurt anyone ! '' He said .   I turned to my companions and said , `` Not yet . Not in the slightest , of course . ''   The giant shook his head and pushed open his left arm , which was covering his entire chest . He then pulled an enormous black-scaled sword from his belt and held it between his teeth . He then pushed another sword onto the ground and then stepped on top of it . He then stood up , and pointed at the mountain .   `` I want to slay you . ''   I shook my head in confusion . `` What are you talking about ? You 've never hurt anyone ! ''   The giant tilted his head back and stared into the distance .   The giant placed his arm on the ground now .   `` You wish to slay me ? '' he asked .   `` Yes . '' I stared at the giant .   `` There is not one who can save you . ''   I shook my head again . `` You can not . ''   The giant looked down again .   `` I can not . ''   I turned to my companions and said , `` You may not . You may not . ''   The giant raised his head and then slowly raised his left hand again , and the sword began to levitate . He then grabbed the sword and held it against his palm . He then placed it back between his teeth .   `` It will be over soon . ''   I looked at the giant .   `` You have not . ''   I stared at the giant .   `` No . ''   I looked at him .   `` No . ''   I looked at his sword .   I stared at the giant .   `` No . '' I said .   The giant leaned forward and looked down . He then pulled out his sword from his belt .   `` I want to slay you . ''   I looked at the giant .  
I 've always been pretty stupid , so if you are reading this , then please let me know whether I 'm doing the right thing or not .    It 's been 18 months now since I died . I was at the age of 14 when my parents died , and that 's how I 'm now here now , living with my parents , and not knowing my life . I only met the mysterious man , the man who told me I could be a success in any field I chose , living my life on a simple idea .    I used to be confident that I would be able to do anything I wanted , even better than I did in my previous life . I grew to know that someday I would reach an impossible goal , and I would be able to prove it . I began to realize that my first day of college I 'd finished off at a prestigious university with honors , and I 'd be able to become a legend .    However , that was n't true until tonight . I saw something different . Someone was standing in front of me , and I jumped back against the wall , surprised . I did n't know what to do , and I did n't think I was ready to stand up .    On the other hand , I did n't want to live my life like I did in mine . I looked back down , and saw a person standing next to me , and I hesitated .    `` Hi ! Welcome to the college I 've been living in for just over 13 years . ''    The person smiled at me in return .    `` I 'm glad you have finally arrived . ''    The person turned to me .    `` I 've reached something . ''    I looked back down . I started laughing . I thought about the other times I saw him , who was really different from me , but I decided against worrying . I looked at the person , and said `` Ah , my . You 've finally made it . ''    I started to walk away .
It was a small hut , hardly even there compared to the one I heard about on TV . There was only one window seat and one wooden stove with a single chair facing the sky . The room was small and there were the bare minimum of furnishings , but when I looked through the window , I saw a bright , gold starry sky , reflecting off of the clouds and sending a light shiver up my spine . I could barely make out the words , but I did say them anyways .   `` Behold , my lord ! '' The voice broke the silence for a moment as I started to look around . At the far end of the hut was a large man in a simple white robe with a button down shirt . It took me a few seconds to realize what he said .   `` What is it , my lord ? '' I asked .   `` What is it ? '' He asked .   `` Some kind of message . '' I replied .   `` What message , my lord ? ''   `` What message ? ''   `` Who is it that could have led me here ? ''   `` I can finally see it . ''   `` Who is it ? ''   `` That is for sure . ''   I realized then the strange man 's face was rather disheveled , and he was wearing a white robe . I decided he was as old as me , so I did n't blame him .   `` What you mean , that is for sure , my lord ? '' I asked .   `` I see it . '' He answered .   `` What is it ? ''   The man in the white robe said , `` I see what you want , my lord . ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` That is for sure , my lord . '' He replied .   I took a moment to ponder that . `` What is it ? What is it ? ''   `` That is the universe . '' He told me .   `` Is there anything else in this universe ? ''   `` There is nothing else in this universe . ''   `` Are you sure ? ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` That is the universe . You see , that is for sure . '' He said .
I loved her . She was the most intelligent person in the world , the world 's greatest minds , and I loved her .   We met a few weeks after our college date , after I graduated from University with a degree for Chemistry . We were both on the same page of a book . We both had such a happy face and a smile . She was everything I wanted in life . From my apartment window to her car seat , her favorite color was purple . It was always her favorite color .   We ran for hours before meeting up again after her first date . We talked for hours about everything we could ever want in life . We both kept in touch for almost a month . Her first crush , Hannah , was very strange . She was the embodiment of everything I was , everything I wanted in life .   Hannah was jealous . She was jealous that I had the courage to date her . She was jealous that I could never get the courage to date her . We did n't know each other at all .   Hannah became really upset . She asked me to marry her . Well , it was kind of a surprise to both of us . She wanted her boyfriend to be with her long times . She wanted to be with me forever . She wanted to be with me forever .   We still have n't found out why she left me , but I 've been going to her place . We have been going for almost a year , but we 've never met , and I have n't seen her . Our relationship had n't worked out , and what have we ? My girlfriend has been cheating on me , and she has been cheating on me too .   If she 'll ever find out why I left her , she 'll say she loves me and she 'll miss me . If she 'll ever find out why I did it again , she 'll say she loves me and she has no choice but to .   I 'm so sorry . I know I 'm sorry for everything that happened , but I do n't know what I did .
When I was a kid , I would go to that supermarket often to buy some ice cream for my sister because she did n't like ice cream , and she did n't like it either , so I did n't . That 's when my dad told me this : `` That 's the best . '' I 'd be able to use that ice cream machine to get better ! `` You 'll be able to save the world ! `` , he said to me . I was excited at first , sure , but it turned out to be just ... wrong . The ice cream machine that I 'd used to make my ice cream machine was now just a dull blur in front of me . The words `` save the world '' on it had changed in all the right places , and I was just worried that I had accidentally messed up . Then , a tear ran down my cheek . I heard my father say , `` We 'll see you later , Mom . ''   I do n't know why I lived with my sister so long , and I 'm not sure why I could n't stop doing things for her . In all honesty , I do n't know what bothered me most the most , but I knew that someday I 'd be able to save the world just right .   On that fateful day , I went to my sister 's car , and they were almost there . I started to drive home , excited , excited , and happy because I had finally done it .  It was almost as if all of our memories could suddenly become connected in a single moment .   Maybe I was just too overwhelmed with joy to care anymore , or maybe the machine was just too ... off .   But all that mattered was that if I was right , if I was wrong , then maybe I could see the world again .
`` Hey Dave , we 're on the run for a little bit ! How are you feeling ? '' Jamie had to give me this look , it would be terrible to get her anything else .   `` Same , I 'm feeling fine . ''   `` Oh yeah ? Who 's the running ? ''   `` Just Dave . ''   `` Alright . Are you feeling better ? ''   `` Ugh ... ''   `` Yeah ? ''   `` Well , how 's the water doing ? ''   `` It 's not running , it 's just ... ''   `` Whatcha mean ? ''   `` Well , we 're running out of food , and it 's getting colder . ''   `` Shut up . You 're the only one with the food . ''   Jamie suddenly stopped , then looked at me , and then back up again .   `` What ... what happened to you ? ''   `` I ... .I do n't know . ''   `` Dave ? ''   `` Yeah ? ''   `` What happened to me ? ''   `` Oh , the water ... .It was ... .it was ... ''   I was sweating . `` It was as well , Dave , but it was probably not enough . ''   `` *I* am sweating , Dave . ''   `` Oh really ? Nothing ... ''   Jamie stared at me . For a few seconds there were only a couple seconds , then they both turned and looked at me .   `` It 's alright , '' Jamie said .   `` What ? ''   Jamie turned around . She turned back to me .   `` Fuck this , '' she screamed . `` Fuck this ! '' She grabbed my shirt and started biting .   `` You , '' Jamie said .   `` Um ... no ... ''   She ran after me , and my shirt was still beating . I just watched as the next few seconds went by , and then I felt the same amount of energy building up in the earth .   I turned back to Jamie , but she was still biting , and I felt the same energy building up in the earth .   I looked at my friend on the ground , her mouth closing and her body slowly turning black , then I felt the energy building up until ...   Jamie was gone .   `` Holy shit , '' I said to myself as I looked at my watch . It read 11:58 .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Sorry if it sucks , I did n't realize that the ending was long-lived and that it was a story I did n't think I could continue if people liked it that way . I wrote more of a prompt response than anything , but the only thing I saw was a prompt response , so it would n't suck too much .
It used to be a tough family . Two young men and a woman , always smiling at each other .   I saw them all , and what would have been a shame that they 'd both missed me , could n't have been more than twelve .   All six of them had a special animal animal . The dragon . The snake . The bear . The wolf . They all were special .   Everyone was born with a dragon . One boy sat in their room , and the other boy left the room . Some had dogs . People kept pets in their homes , but there was no other option .   At age nine , the people start talking about their animal . They talk about all their animals . They talk about their lives . They keep talking about their family . They do n't ask for pets , they just want to be with their family , and never talk to the end .   I only now realized why .   It started as a simple prank . As a child , I could tell my parents that they were being sarcastic . They would laugh and cry , and then they all got up and went to the door . They did n't expect it to be any trouble .   But as I got older , there was a lot more news about the monster that was out there . I became increasingly increasingly nervous .   I grew into a soldier . I knew this . I could feel my nerves beginning to grow . I was constantly reminded that it was dangerous . The fear that maybe there would be a monster or something like that .   I never understood .   I kept trying .   Until finally , I fell asleep .   I awoke to the sound of a large explosion . I knew I was going to have a very large explosion in seconds , and so I drifted off to sleep .   I woke up as a bright light filled the room . I stood up and saw two men standing in front of a large fire .   `` Are you okay , son ? '' One asked .   `` Yeah , I 'm okay . '' The other said . `` Go ahead , lie down , and we 'll get you settled in . ''   `` What ? '' I asked , confused .   `` Alright , well , we 're going to let you sleep for a bit , '' the one said to me , turning and walking away .   I was n't going to let myself be settled in .
`` Captain ? ''   `` Yep , right here . ''   `` Are you sure ? ''   `` Yeah , right here . ''   *Ahem , that 's odd , since my ship is about to crash , and I 'm supposed to die of some sort of heart attack , right ? *   `` What 's wrong , you need to leave immediately . ''   `` Right here . ''   `` And I want to make sure I have a suit to stay warm while I wait here . ''   `` I do n't understand . Are you sure you 're going to jump out of my ship and get into the atmosphere ? ''   `` Yeah . ''   *They are n't even that far out ... *   `` What ? ''   `` The atmosphere is very bad , but we 're looking forward to seeing you again in a few weeks ! ''   `` Why is , I want to see you again . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I 've got a thousand fucking options . One , if you kill me , you can get shot , or one , if you kill me , you can get killed . ''   `` How far do you want me to go before we 're here ? ''   `` Only a few hundred , and I ca n't even get to the surface . ''   `` Alright , look , we 'll make it , can we ? ''   `` Let 's take a look at your suit , and see what it looks like ! ''   `` Hah , I guess . You could run , but that wo n't work , the surface is too thick for anything , so you ca n't run . ''   `` So you 're not going to kick me out ? ''   `` Yes . ''   *We should go figure what is going to happen when you do ? If we die , we 'll end up in space , and all we 'll do is run . Do n't worry , it wo n't be too hard to find your suit or run , and we 'll be safe . *   `` Okay , let 's do it . We 're going to make it here , I 'm going to give you some oxygen , and we 're going back . ''   *I love you , and thank you for your choice . But I know it 's not going to work . *   `` ... Fine . All I have to do is tell you what 's going to happen here . ''   *Then I 'll jump out . And my suit will do nothing but hurt you . *   `` ... ... I 'm sorry ? ''  
The man stood in the center of the field , his face in the grass . He had been here every day . A long time .   He had lived in this field his whole life . How long had he been in this field ? Had he waited so long , this time he had finally found peace . A peaceful peace he had enjoyed . How long had he waited ?   He slowly raised his head slowly , walking slowly toward the man . His head slowly moving as he held the clipboard in his trembling palm . He waited .   Finally , after what seemed an eternity , the man reached out and touched him lightly . He was calm . He did n't even have to look at himself to know what he was doing . He still had the clipboard , even if he just shook it off .   ** '' Hello , '' **   ** '' It seems that you are finally free of the curse , '' ** a voice spoke out , ** '' you are now immortal . I have come to ask all your questions . I will have to tell you one thing that you will have to know . '' **   ** '' Who 's the new person ? '' **   ** '' Ah , yes , the man who will be the new person . He will not pass judgment . He was a mere mortal mere twenty years ago . I , the new person , he is the new person . '' **   ** '' Wait a second ! `` **   ** '' That 's right , ahem . Before you ask me my name , how do you know who I am ? '' **   ** '' Well , I am the new person . You are a small girl . I am about the same age as you and the man of the future who will become the new version of that man . `` **   ** '' Does that make sense ? What does that mean ? `` **   ** '' Well , first of all , I am a new person . As a man of old , some will be able to be called old . As a man of old , some will attempt to be called old . I will be much more specific . I am the new version of that man , '' **   ** '' So this will be how you know my name ? `` **   ** '' Well , it appears that you now have the power to know what will happen . Once you are done here , you can choose to stay . I will be the new version of that man , who is now your new version of that new person . '' **   ** '' So , what else am I supposed to do with this power ? `` **   ** '' You can choose to keep living , or you can stay here , until the next instance , while you have no other choice . If you choose , I will continue to exist until the next moment . If you choose , you will live for as long as you live , until you can finally experience peace without pain and suffering . Once you have lived , you may pass judgement . Just as I have always wanted to live , I will not be able to pass judgment . I will have to tell you the next time you have passed judgment , as well as how you will live forever . ''   ** '' I know this sounds ridiculous . How do you know my name ? `` **   ** '' Because , it was chosen to be said to be my name . If I was to pass judgement , I would be forever young and not bound by fate . You will never pass judgment . You will never be able to pass judgement . You will never know the world . That world would eventually pass judgement without you . Because , it was my name . My name . I lived forever to escape fate . Or if I chose to live , I would be forced to live forever into the future . The entire universe has passed judgment without you , but it will pass judgement without you . '' **   ** '' Wait . What do you mean judgment ? `` **   ** '' Oh . Well , I guess I am here to say judgement . I guess you are the last of your kind . You will die in the present . The next time you are judged , you will die in the next life . Again , I will be forced to live forever , but this time , I will only continue to live in the present . I am the last of your kind , and I am sorry . Goodbye . '' **   ** '' Goodbye ! Goodbye !

All I could think about was the possibility of home . The idea of finally settling down to the Earth and finding someone else , somebody new to life without a family , someone ... well , I guess I should 've been more positive . The days were hard , but I had the dream to myself . It was in that moment when I realized that I did n't have enough time . The problem began three months ago . I had done this a thousand times , in hopes that I could find the answer to something I had never known . I tried to move to New York , but I realized I could n't , and moved so far away from civilization . All the things I had seen were only dreams .   The dream that I had made as a detective had left me utterly depressed . Two months after I had moved to New York I had begun to think back on it . The dream I shared with my partner , the woman I had always loved , was the one that had given me hope , as an addict , that I had finally found a way to cure the sick . I had tried everything , but the things that I had truly done to save lives were the things that saved my partner .   I found myself in New York . It was a strange place , but it seemed so small . Sure , I could find people , but I had done it in hopes of finding someone else . It was at that moment that I realized that no one else had lived here before me , and I was truly hopeless . I had to make my way into New York , to find a way to save my partner , to save my partner .   There was one thing that I missed . I had never thought about it before . I knew every way around the world , everything I knew about how God worked , how God existed , and why ... I started to become confused as I realized that I would never find the answers . I was simply too excited for the big man , so I quickly started to walk around . It was n't long before I stopped in front of the grocery store .   I noticed a man in his late 30s . He had a cane in his hands . His face was very old , so he looked so tired ...   I said , `` Hello , detective . How are you feeling ? ''   The man smiled , `` Good news . Your partner will be arriving shortly . ''   I began to walk out the door , but the man in the cane had just left . Out of curiosity , I turned around and headed back to the window . There was a man in the distance . He looked very tired .   I looked back up to the window , and there was a man walking around the town . I looked at the man in the cane , and he smiled even wider . I had forgotten about the man in the cane , to which I replied , `` Good news . My partner will be arriving soon . ''   When I asked him what he wanted to do , he nodded . I knew that he would want to leave . I was going to help him , and I would do the best I could .   I walked back to the window , but I could n't find him . So I looked back up . There was another man walking around the city , too old . He looked at me , and said , `` Alright , detective . If you 're going to walk away from the window , I 'm going to go out there . ''   I looked back up at the window , and my body lost all sense of time . I did n't realize what was coming .   I looked around , but could n't find a door . There was no window in New York . I began to panic , but I could n't find any other door .   I looked into the window again , and the man slowly walked towards the window . He looked at me . I was taken aback and lost in thought , but I decided to go face to face with him .   `` Hi , '' he said . `` How are you feeling ? ''
`` All weapons are under quarantine , ladies and gentleman . I have to speak with the Commander of the United States . ''   The Commander stopped before me and nodded . And then he walked away .   `` Sir , I would like to ask you a question . ''   I looked up , startled at what a question he was .   `` Sir , you have to shoot any enemy that you see . You must . ''   I shot him with my handgun , but he pulled away .   `` Sir ? ''   I heard his footsteps as he walked away over the din of the conference table .   `` Sir ? ''   He stopped abruptly , his footsteps growing louder .   `` Sir , we will be sending word of an imminent threat to the United States . ''   I looked up , panic creeping in my own eyes . I looked back down at my gun . And then I looked back up at him .   `` Sir , I will shoot any enemy that you see . ''
`` So , you 're saying we can keep this together ? '' asked the President .  `` Yes , sir , I 'm saying it should , for at least a couple of weeks . ''  `` Then do you think we can sort out all our troubles ? ''  `` Yes , sir ! '' said the President .  `` So you 're saying we should tell them how to fix all them ? ''  `` Yes , sir ! '' said the President . `` We should tell them how to fix everything else . But ... ''  `` Then do you think they should call a meeting ! ? ''  `` Sure , sir ! ''  `` And what 's your plan for them ? ''  `` Well , sir , we need to be on the phone with every major company owned by Google . This works ! ''  The presidents face went pale .  `` Of course , sir ! '' said the President . `` I thought all these questions were answered because of this arrangement . ''  `` Yes , sir ! '' said the President cheerfully . `` Now , we 've got to make a decision . ''  With a large smile , the President let go of the phone .  `` Thank you , sir ! '' said the President as he walked away .  ****   * Thanks for reading !

`` You 're not allowed to leave , Mr . Gwen . I 'll take this box if you promise not to leave . ''   `` Really ? Are you sure ? Now can you please understand if I please ? ''   `` I want you to have a safe place with my wife . If you can find a place that is safe , then you will be safe . ''   `` You promise not to leave ? What secrets do you have ? ''   `` She 's safe . Just keep on going . Just keep going . ''   The house shook and the small figure climbed the steps of the stairs , silently and steadily , still , until the small woman reached the top . She pushed open the box on the other side of the room and hesitated , trying to see if she was going to make it . She did n't see anything in the room , not that she had any choice but to assume that the box would remain intact .   She climbed out of the box , almost dropping the box as she ran into the room , only her feet on the floor . She looked up at the ceiling and held her gaze for the longest time . She could n't see anything outside - not even a foot . After a moment , she saw her heartbeat - a very slow steady pulsating . She stopped in her tracks , waiting for a response .   `` Hello ? '' she asked , not expecting any response .   `` Hello ? ''   `` Hello ! '' she yelled , still not expecting any response .   `` Hello ? '' she repeated . Her eyes widened when the ceiling came in front of her .   `` Hello ? '' she repeated . As she opened her eyes , the noise had ceased . She could hear the sound of her breathing . She did n't know why she could n't feel anything but the rhythmic pounding . She walked back to her bedroom , opened the door , and waited for the lights to go out . She closed the door and locked it .
`` Ok '' I said `` You must understand , '' the genie said in perfect English , `` I 'm a perfectly fine man '' .   I sat down on the curb ( is that a park I frequent in the middle of July ) and said , `` Well , I found a lamp that looked exactly like my car , not your vehicle . I thought it was weird but it 's not . It 's actually kind of the same thing . I do n't even recognize the name of it . ''   The genie rolled his eyes and said , `` Sorry '' .   I stood up , `` Okay '' I said .   The genie rolled his eyes and said , `` You should realize that the ability to go back in time is very limited and it only takes the most advanced of genies to be a genie . ''   I turned around and the genie said , `` I guess you wish for a bit more time '' .   I smiled , `` Thank you '' I said .   The genie rolled his eyes again and said , `` No problem '' .  
That was it , that was it . No longer the one who was waiting for this opportunity to be revealed to him , he was now the man who had decided to take the day off , at the park where children would play and read . He was the man who had finally decided to take the day off , at the park where children would read and write .   It was all bullshit now , it was all fake , and now only he was left to sit , and wait for this chance to show him the truth . One day , he would be allowed to play with all the children , with the parents of the children , and he would take it , he would take it and show everyone , with the parents of the children . 
* '' I 'm not wearing pants ... '' *   `` Sir , I have a situation that I need you to take care of . ''   The man in the white lab coat , the one that I 'd seen on horror movies when I was 6 , was dressed in a weird suit .  My only interaction with him was at my football practice . I did n't expect him to be standing there and apologizing in such a sarcastic fashion . That is to say , he spoke , not in any words I recognised but in a tone that conveyed confusion .   `` I ... ''   `` Sir , I have a situation that you need me to take care of . ''   I 'd been practicing sports since high school . I 'd never been the best in my class , my grades and my grades above average just made me the second strongest . But this time , this time , I was *better* . I looked like I could do anything I wanted .   I 'd never lost a race in my life .   The man in the white lab coat went to my locker , put his hand on my heart and said , `` You can just take care of your life . ''   I backed away from him , thinking more about what might have happened if I turned around .   `` Why did you- ''   `` I do n't want you to kill me . ''   I was shaking . What was he talking about ?   `` No , I want you to die . ''   My heart was pounding so fast I felt dizzy and I was trying to sit up .   I felt one of the straps around my ankles push me down .   The suit lifted me up and whispered in my ear , `` Do n't go . ''   I felt a tug on my shirt when I was finally able to move forward . I was in a room with a huge black desk , almost like a prison .   The black man continued , `` You wo n't get away with this . ''   I sat down on the desk , the chair creaking and shaking as he spoke , `` Please . Please . Be the one who knows what happened . ''   I tried to move away from him , but the chair would n't budge . He pushed me up again and shouted , `` Do n't go . I do n't want you to die . ''   I was lying down on the floor , blood pouring out of my wound . I could n't move at all , my legs were failing me , something was desperately wrong . I tried to stand up , but my legs were still there . I could still hear the click of the black-suited man 's watch .   I slowly stood up , and walked over to the black-suited man .   `` Go . '' I pleaded , knowing what was happening .   He looked disappointed , `` What do you mean , go ? ''   `` I mean , I just- . I mean this man . He 's been in the lab for six months for 6 months . ''   `` Who are you ? ''   `` The black-suited man , '' the man in the white lab coat spat out , `` The guy with the watch . ''   I felt like I could do anything I wanted . Nothing .   `` Do n't go . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I put my hands on my stomach and breathed deeply .   `` I 'm not wearing pants ... ''
You know how it goes . You ’ re the first one to join the ranks by signing up for . The other three get up , and you sit in the leather chair next to me , reading a lot of newspapers and listening to music . I don ’ t think I was going to be anywhere near this position for long , until that stupid guy next to me signed up for the same company . This one is more interesting , and he ’ s probably a fucking professional . He must have seen something . I ’ m sure he knows as well as I do , but he doesn ’ t know his name . And he ’ s probably going to let the guy sign . Or , who knows , maybe he ’ ll even break the fucking silence . Is that your job ? You don ’ t have to do this . I would rather spend my days in this office , and the days with him , and other people , and other people .   I look at the paper on the table and look at my watch . 9:47pm . Do you know what time it is ? 9:48pm . I get up and leave . I leave and don ’ t get back into the office . I stand here in silence , waiting . I look to my watch again and see that it ’ s 9:49pm . I take a deep breath and close my eyes before opening them again to check on me . I see nothing . I ’ m in a train car . This is definitely going to take a while . Just as I start to panic , I feel a hand on my shoulder . I look up and see that somebody is standing in front of me . I look down and see that I ’ m wearing a black dress with black pants underneath . I look up and see that I ’ m not in a train car .   “ Who are you ? ” I ask , trying to make a sound I can understand . I answer , unsure of what to say . “ My name ’ s Josh. ” I tell the person in front of me . “ My name ’ s Josh . Can you tell me yours ? ” I ask . “ My name ’ s Dan . My family thinks I ’ m the top leader and leader of the free world. ” Dan states . “ I was born in China because I am a Chinese citizen and live in the United States . My mother is in China and served here in the United States. ” Dan gestures to his wife in the seat down behind him . She nods , and motions for me to sit . “ Well , it ’ s a shame that you have to be in this seat where the train station is next to the train tracks , ” she tells me again . I look back at her and say , “ My mom and I have become friends , but we ’ ve never really liked each other , ” she continues . “ I like to chat and talk about it , but eventually , I start feeling stressed. ” Dan begins to laugh . I look down at my watch again , and notice that it ’ s 9:49pm . I open my eyes again to see that it ’ s 9:48pm . I look down at my watch again and see that it ’ s 9:48pm . I try to rub the stress off my shoulders and pull myself up from my seat to stand up again . I try to make a sound I can understand . “ I ’ m sorry , ” I say to myself , but the smile on my face changes to something else . “ I ’ m sorry , ” I repeat to myself , and I close my eyes . I pull myself up off the floor . I look around at the room to see that people are staring at me , and I see Dan ’ s wife with black heels in front of her . The train door opens up and Dan steps in . I look at Dan , and I see Dan ’ s wife with black heels leading toward the train station . I look at her and see something else completely different . “ I ’ m sorry , ” I say to myself . “ I ’ m sorry , ” I repeat , and I open my eyes again to see that it ’ s 11:50pm . I look down and see that I ’ m watching my watch again . I look down and see that it ’ s 11:59pm . I look up and see that my watch is 11:00pm . I look down and see that the train car door closes . I look down and see that my watch has 11:59pm . I look down and see that my watch has 11:59pm . I look down and see that my watch has 11:58pm . I look down and
A moment ago all I saw was smoke . A crack broke all I could see . I think I saw some of the fires begin to burn . I look over at my wife , where she is standing . I look at my son , whom is still alive . I look at my daughter , she is still alive .   `` We finally got him . ''   My wife looks down at the hole where the fire had left her . She picks up the remains of our son and smiles .   `` Well son . ''   I turn on my son 's light . It is still on . I think I saw one of the flames begin to glow . I think I saw one of the flames begin to glow .   `` Can we go to the hospital ? ''   I say my son ,   `` No sons . This is the hospital . ''   I look at my wife . She does not look at me . She does not move . I look at my son and smile . My wife moves towards the window . She turns on her light .   `` Who are you to watch the flames burn ? ''   She does not move .   `` Son . We 've got to get him ! ''   I reach for my son . He is still alive .   `` Come on . We have to go . ''   I start to climb towards the window . I climb up myself . Another crack broke all I could see . I look at my wife . She is still alive .   `` They 're not there anymore . ''   I look at my wife . She does not look at me .   `` They 're not there anymore . ''   My wife looks at me . She does not look at anything .   `` What are we going to do ? ''   My wife looks at my son . She does not look into the flames .   `` They 're not there anymore . ''   The crack splits all I could see . I look at my wife . She does not glance into the flames .   `` They 're not there anymore . ''   The crack splits all I could see . I look at my wife . She does not look at anything . I look at my son . He does not look into the flames .   `` They 're not there anymore . ''   The crack splits all I could see . I look towards my wife .   `` They 're not there anymore . ''   The crack split all I could see .
We all knew it was n't just a joke , just how crazy it felt .   The man that made the first sound in history was not a man , he was a God of Death , a God of Heaven , and God of Hell .   He told us that all those people were born without parents . And that when they died , they had no family . The only people left in this world were those that survived , and those that remained were all we had left .   But we were n't alone .   And for most of us , that 's when it all began .   The first sounds of death was more terrifying , each one more horrifying than the last , but that was a time long past .   A time of pain , of suffering , of suffering .   A time where people died without knowing they were dead , of misery . 
The crowd was silent for a few moments as the preacher took his time reading . It was another long day at the office for me . I suppose I 'm in luck . Usually I do n't have the most memorable days of my life .   I guess I 'll just sit here and watch . This is my funeral and I can finally relax . I had n't felt more like I had in a long time .   I guess today was the day he announced his death . It would be my last chance to be remembered in my life . I do n't really care how much his life is worth and how much my regrets are . I am ready .   I sat here and watched and waited . The procession was as if it had never started . I knew it was time to go . The pastor smiled .   `` He was the most hateful person I have ever met , and he wanted to make everyone feel bad . You ca n't argue with a man who has stolen a person 's life , let alone his own . He 's disgusting . And I mean disgusting . So I can n't argue with you anymore . ''   It 's a tough speech , but he did it . He did it because he knew he was the most hated person I have ever met , and he knew he could do whatever he wanted for eternity .   And he knew he could do anything that people would really like . He just was n't a good person .   So anyway , I 'm going to keep watching and watching . And if I did n't want to know my last steps , I 'd check myself out through the window .
I could n't remember the first time I felt sorry for him . I had a few days , but I could n't remember the second .   He was standing there , with a bottle of wine in his hand , staring at her .   `` I saw you last week , '' he said , `` in a dive bar a couple of years back . ''   And then he went to the bar , and all I could do was sit there , awkwardly waiting for her to pull him away .   I 'd ask her to hang up , but she just sighed and said , `` I was having a party . ''   `` Sorry , '' I said .   `` Do n't worry about it , '' she said .   `` Sure thing , '' I said .   They sat there , until I went home . An hour later , I got a call that she might be home . She was , of course , home . She was , after all , eighteen years old .   `` Hello , '' I said , `` My name 's Hannah . ''   `` Hi . ''   `` Your mom gave you the best birthday gift by the way , right ? ''   `` Yeah , '' I said .   `` I 'm so sorry , '' she said .   I was n't surprised . She did n't say anything -- just stared at me , and not for a while until she made a move to come on .   `` Thank you , '' I said .   We sat there in silence for some time until she finally returned .   `` What changed ? '' I asked .   `` I do n't know , '' Hannah said .   `` I thought it was beautiful , '' I said .   `` It was , '' Hannah said . `` It was , too , the least beautiful thing I could ever have . ''   `` So ... a little ? '' I asked .   `` Yeah , '' Hannah said . `` I 'm sixteen now . ''   `` For you , too , '' I said . `` But why ? ''   `` I do n't know . I do n't know . ''   `` Yeah , '' she said . `` You might want to watch a movie , though . ''   `` Sure ! It 'll be good .

*This is my first post on here . Feedback is appreciated . *     It was a beautiful day , but there was something out of place . It was bright , early in the morning , the sky light red , indicating the midday sun was moving down behind a low hill , taking up much of the sky . The hills were still fields of wheat , yet the grasses were empty .   The air was a pleasant smell , coming from among the rows of fields . A small , small cloud hung low over the whole area , showing an arc of light , which seemed to go on for about a minute .   The clouds continued to move , more and more in a state of disarray . The few remaining cars that did n't have enough power to drive by were unable to survive the intense heat , and most of the farmers and farmhands were unable to work with what supplies they had left . They all sat in silence , waiting for the sun to pass by . The sky was silent for most of the day , still in sync with the sky .   A few minutes later , a figure emerged from a cloud , floating above the dirt and grass . It was covered in thick , black clothing , a large black hat and cloak , and something else .   A large animal stood in front of the figure , with eyes as bright as the sun . It did not move , but stared at the sky as if preparing to reveal itself .  The figure lunged forward , clawed at the ground , and fell ... the sound was muted by the grasses , but something else .  A large humanoid form rose out of the cloud , its long , skeletal fingers extending . It spoke as it slowly approached the sky , and spoke into its helmet , `` Human , are you certain you will survive the next day ? ''   `` I am sure , thank you . ''   The Human stood still , then continued to stare at the sky . `` As you wish , I come back for you . ''   The creature opened its mouth to speak , but before it could continue , it noticed that the green grass around it seemed to glow , and it was about to turn around entirely when a large , long-limbed creature emerged from the cloud , standing next to the small , black creature .   The creature sighed , and turned around one last time . `` I beg of you , human , for help . ''   The Human nodded and began to move towards the humanoid . `` We need it to stay in our houses , and you need it to stay in our factories , and you need it to stay in our homes , and you need it to stay in our streets . ''   The creature placed a hand over the Human 's shoulder , and the creature looked up at the sky again . `` I will take care of you . ''
The voice echoed through the night .   The wind blew softly through the trees . A low growl emanated from behind her . She slowly slid to her knees and strode across the barren landscape . Her backpack lay by her side , forgotten . She did n't need to clean it .   She took a deep breath , put it out on her cheek , and looked around . She could n't be sure if it was from the woods or the wind itself . She could only pretend it was just a whisper .   She did n't want to know ; she did n't want to know what it was . She could only pretend it was something else . But this could n't be right .   She needed to know why . What were her memories , why would the voice echo so loud and she had to use that to destroy them ?   She walked slowly towards the sounds of the wind , carefully brushing the dirt off her boots . She felt the warmth of the sun on her arms , and knew it was time to say goodbye to the world .   `` Goodbye , Michael . ''   A short smile spread across her face . The wind rustled through her hair again , and she felt the warmth of the sun again . She closed her eyes .   She started to cry .   The voices echoed throughout the night .
`` Ha ! ! '' I shrieked as I shot back a few inches before collapsing . It was n't in the best of times . I was tired of this city . It was all over .   So I took it upon myself to take a look at the lifeless bodies falling against the wall . The pain was n't that bad . The adrenaline that ran through my veins was enough . Fuck , I would n't have had to do this if I had n't done this job too well . And the more I thought about it the more I realized why I would have to do this .   So I told myself that I would have to do whatever I could to save the day . So I took the time to think about the world . How I had always been a powerful man . My powers naturally suited my weaknesses . So I built my own super-villain community .   You see , it was a small colony . Many of the citizens were homeless or desperate or barely lived . They all had families . Some were orphaned or even killed recently . I worked tirelessly to make sure the community did not need help . All the while I 'd wait for someone to come to their aid . Not just anyone .   It was time to act . I needed to take down the mayor .   `` I need you to stop attacking me , '' I said to the empty city . The mayor was the closest thing I had to a connection to my mother and father . I knew what I had to do .   `` I need you to start a war . ''   `` No ! ! ! ! '' I screamed , my voice shaking . I could n't do this ! No one needed help either . I had to be a hero . I had to save the day .   I could only whisper a little in response to my command .   `` There is no war anymore . ''   For a second my vision of the bustling city darkened , leaving the area of dark to dark . I was finally able to see the whole city . The scene was a masterpiece of color , but it was n't the best I had ever seen . I never wanted to see this city again . I had to do it .   I pulled the trigger . There was a faint click as the bullet lodged itself deep into my chest . I felt nothing .   `` Oh God , '' I screamed .   I just stared at the lifeless body lying on the ground . I know what you 're thinking . I just do n't know .
It 's been over 3000 years since my last visit . It is the year 2022 , 2099 . I ca n't even begin to describe what I see , how I feel and how happy I am . In fact , I have n't realized how excited I am until I started to feel it . It is a sense of dread and sadness that is all I 've come to realize . I can almost taste it . I can feel it , right in front of me . It feels good , as right in front of me . It is amazing . I realize now why humans live like this . I am the center of attention in this world . I am the center of communication . Oh my god , how can I remember it ? It is so perfect . I am the center of attention . Oh my God , can I not remember if I wanted to be the center of attention ? It is so perfect . How could they possibly want me to be the center of attention ? I just wanted to know who my father was . How could I possibly be the center of attention ?   I think they might want me to know the secret to their success . When the year 2099 decided they would go all out over the world , they wanted me to be the center of attention . The most successful of politicians . In fact , I think they might want me to be the center of attention . How could such a powerful person want me to be the center of attention ? I can tell you these things . As soon as I do this I will be the center of attention . There is no doubt in my mind that I should be the center , but I 've only ever used this term in my head . You can see me ? I have no idea . I do n't know what I 'm doing here . What I 'm doing here . I do n't know what I 'm doing here . I do n't know what I 'm doing here . There is no doubt in my mind that today I will be the center of attention . This is the day of the apocalypse . What if I am the center of attention ? Will anyone notice me ? Do I exist ?

The woman stared blankly at him . The stench of rot hung in the air like a blanket . A black fog had blanketed the area surrounding him for no apparent reason . Her skin was pale but her eyes were soft and piercing . She looked frail . She looked into his eyes and smiled deeply .   `` So you 're saying that was the scar ? ''   `` Yes . ''   She laughed and opened her mouth again as she spoke but he did not respond .   `` You were born a ways ago . You will never know this . ''   He looked at her aghast at her offer of the gift . He gave it all up in a quick and fluid motion . She laughed again with a bit of contentment in her voice .   `` What 's it like to heal ? '' she asked quietly .   `` I have no idea ... '' he said without turning away from the woman . He wanted her to tell him the truth .   `` Well , is life worth anything just to heal ? '' she asked . He thought about it for a moment . He did not know how to begin to explain it .  *It 's been ... * he thought . *It 's been a long and difficult time . It feels like it is . I do n't know what I am after all . *   `` I am not a person , '' he said and swallowed hard . He looked at the woman 's hand . His other hand was warm and warm but his skin was pale and piercing . She smiled knowingly again a loud and abrupt laugh .   `` I am so sorry , '' she said in tears and said , `` I should never have to hurt you like this . '' 
The doorbell rang , a small red light flicked on . I looked down at my phone , I started to scroll through my contacts . A girl was walking down the street , she 'd walked into my room , my phone vibrating . My phone vibrated again , this time I checked my phone . 3:15 am I could n't be late for her to school .   `` Mom , you 've been in a real bad mood since last night . '' I said , pulling my phone from my pocket .   `` Mum , I 'd just say hi , '' she said , wiping her brow .   I stood up quickly , it felt like 4:35 am , almost time to go to school . I pulled the door open , my feet sliding behind me . I walked down the street , a slight breeze blew through the window . As I approached the door the girl stopped , her hair whipped around her face . She turned to me .   `` Hi ! '' she said , her face red . `` So you can sit down , we know we 're not going to trouble . ''   `` Thanks ! '' I said , grabbing a beer and tossing it on the ground . I looked at the girl , she was still at her desk , her phone still vibrating .   `` How are you doing ? '' She asked , her eyes were glazed over .   `` I 'm fine , '' I said , throwing myself into the couch . I pulled out a small , cloth , and covered them up . `` I just came here to make sure it was n't some weird accident . ''   She looked at me with wide eyes , `` Really , this is n't weird ? ''   I looked back at her , `` What 's wrong ? ''   `` Nothing , '' she said , `` Just thought I knew something . ''   `` What do you mean it was n't some strange accident ? '' I asked , lifting up her head . `` I 'm just standing in your closet . ''   `` So , is this a weird dream ? '' She asked , looking at me with wide eyes .   I shook my head , `` No . ''   `` You mean , is this a dream ? To find someone you cared about while you slept ? '' She said , looking at me with wide eyes .   I shrugged , `` Yeah . It gives me a headache . ''   `` It 's usually not weird , it makes me sleepy . I just wanted to get back to sleep . ''   I stood up , putting on my coat , and walked down the hall to where I held my phone .   `` Here 's your cellphone , I 've got something to show you . '' After walking up to my room and opening the door , I turned the light on and walked into the kitchen and pushed the button on the door .   `` Welcome home , '' I said , putting my hand on the doorknob .   `` Hi ! '' she said , her eyes widened as she stood up . `` This is n't a dream ! ''   I grabbed her hand and held it out to her , and we walked in .   `` Mom , I 'm home . '' I said , pulling out my phone and dialing my father .   `` He 's coming back , '' my father said .   `` He 's coming back ? '' she said , looking down at the phone .   `` Yes , he came back yesterday , '' I said , looking at my legs . `` He 's gone . ''
My compliments are welcome , and appreciated !   Picking off the main character and the first few chapters on this series are really well done . The fight was really easy , and certainly not one where a man and a woman are sharing a drink ; the fight was fun ! It was , despite being a bit strange , an enjoyable read . You have some fantastic imagery and descriptions and descriptions .   Other than that , please do n't consider having it a series . I loved your pacing on this one , considering I enjoyed almost every single one . Enjoy !
I have always been a mage . I know that . I am the one who has to fight evil enemies to progress . I am able to outrun the evil that has plagued my lands and restore what is rightfully mine . You see , I am the hero . I have everything in the world , so I can save the world . I can build a wall and destroy monsters , but only for a little bit .   Ever since I was a young child , I had seen the world in an odd way . The world was not always like this . It had no wars , no war . It was like I was walking through the desert with the cool breeze . I could see the sun shine down from the sky . I could see the mountains that have been ravaged by the dark beast that terrorized my land . I could see them grow and grow until I would never see them again .   And then , finally , I could forget the world . I could forget everything that I have ever done , all my enemies , all my lives .   It did n't matter what I did , I can not forget what I lost .   The adventurers did n't always come back . They always appeared to me , begging for me to return . I did n't know what to do . I do n't know how to stop them . They gave up , let them go , and when they did , I broke protocol . They started raving about me . Then , I stopped them . They were all dead , and it was only a matter of time before I was reborn as a hero .   Now , I am retired from the city , and I live in a farm house in Northern California . I can no longer live my life as a mage . I can not just come back .   I am so happy , so hopeless , and so lonely . I have never had a good time .   I love you . I miss you so much .
I 'm sitting by Mom 's bedside when the phone rings . I answer it , my own voice echoing across the house .   `` It 's me James . Can you drop the phone ? ''   My voice is barely audible in the background , barely audible for a second . I sit there staring at my screen , my mind blanked .
It used to be so easy .  I would run and hide in plain sight until the next stormstorm . On top of my family I would come out as a celebrity and I would raise my family in the sky . Then one day I would appear in the middle of the sky , screaming and cheering `` AHHH ! '' and I would grab my wife and children while calling for help and crying `` AHHH ! '' and I would begin to float up towards the clouds .  For a few months I flew low , constantly and never slowing . During my winter vacation I would rest but never coming back . I would spend time in the water , it was good to spend time outside . Then one day I came across a strange looking fellow in the sky . I thought he was just being crazy and I headed for him to ask him if he knew where he was . He did . I talked in his native tongue and asked him to come out to see me . He did . I traveled around the world looking for a new planet and there he came .  While I waited for him to land in the water I found him . He was lying on a dusty beach with a hole in his back with a hole in his back . He was n't breathing , he was holding a pipe and gasping for air . He looked at me and said `` AHHH ! ! '' before he died .  I had my parents payed handsomely for the trip and I turned to leave quickly . I began to run towards the water . I reached a spot where I could pull myself away from the water and quickly caught up to him . He took the pipe next to him and breathed in deeply . I gave him the pipe and he started coughing uncontrollably .  After a few minutes he choked again . After a few seconds he started coughing uncontrollably . He started to cough violently . Eventually he started coughing harder and harder . His eyes started to water . It was as if he was seeing that I was standing here right now just staring at him . I started to run towards him . I finally reached him . I ran back towards the water as fast as I could . Before I could make it away the great water came pouring down from the sky and hit the ground . I started to run down the ravine towards my family . The water began to pierce my body and I could feel my blood boiling and hot . I then felt my body being ripped off instantly and I fell to the ground . The water began to warm everything up and I felt a thick feeling of heat rush over me . I looked around for something that would make it all go away . I looked at the nearby water and saw a massive hole in my back . Another hole opened and a giant chunk of water was pouring down to the ground . I felt it all go away . I quickly began to swim away . I then felt waves rush over me and I turned around in fear . I jumped off of the ravine and tried to get away but I was still swimming away . I stood up and dived towards the water . Before I could die I heard one of my family members shout down to me `` HELP ! ! ! ''  I jumped back and began to swim away . I heard my family members yell in rage and then a loud crash . I jumped to my feet and ran away the same way it had all gone . I landed on a nearby pine deck . I picked up the pipe and emptied it into the hole . I jumped to the safety of the water to check for damage . After a few minutes I woke up to people chasing me . They were cheering my name by jumping in to save me from the water . They all ran off towards me and I then heard them yelling in vain . I ran after them and they kept running . I grabbed my feet and dove into the hole . I ran along the beach until I reached a large canyon . I then ran to a small town located on the edge of the canyon . I ran for several blocks until I came to a small town . I looked up to see the town had a giant hole in the ground . I jumped in to it and yelled out to the people . They all looked at me and nodded sadly . I then heard a noise from the town and took a look inside . I saw a huge hole in the ground . I jumped inside and pulled out the pipe and poured water into it . The people had died of thirst . I decided to use it to get away from the people and I turned to see where they were going . I saw people were running towards me and I started to laugh . At this point I realized that I was immortal and no pain was felt . I suddenly realized that all of my life I had lived on Earth was just a cruel joke but I had no control over what went on . I was forevermore doomed to die on Earth . I walked towards the town and sat down on the outskirts .
`` I stole her . That ai n't a word , but she 's mine . ''   `` What ? ! '' I could n't believe it . What a load of bullshit ! Had she ever stolen her money ? Did she use it as a car insurance policy ?   `` No . I 'm serious . That ai n't a word . '' My wife 's tone was incredulous . I had no choice . I wanted to show her . I wanted to tell her about her dreams and the fun she 'd created .   `` No , I could n't ! I stole her . '' Something was almost wrong with my tone . My wife 's tone was stern .   ____   `` I swear , she stole my purse ! ''   `` She said she 'd never steal mine a song . ''   `` No , she never said she 'd steal me a song . No . She said she 'd never steal mine a song , because she 'd never steal me a song . ''   `` No , she took my purse . ''   `` Yeah , she took my purse . Is that what she said ? What 's wrong ? ''   `` Yeah , she stole my purse . '' The silence fell . She would n't lie . She would n't tell me her money was worthless . She would n't tell me anything about her dreams and the fun she 'd created .   `` I stole her ! ''   `` No ! that ai n't a word . ''
“ The old Man and Lady were born in the Great War ’ s End , ” The author said , placing his hands around Harry by the hair , “ and the Man and Lady were raised in the middle of the war , and were raised in the East , and were raised in the North . They both lived in harmony , and since birth , neither of their parents had passed away. ”   Harry ’ s brow furrowed , and he furrowed his brow again .   “ Neither of their parents ever fought . They were both trained by the same bloodline . Both trained with the same path . Both trained for the same thing . Both trained for the same thing . Both trained for the same thing. ”   The author smiled , then took the book from Harry ’ s hands .   “ Now , do you believe that the Man and Lady had been born in the middle of the war. ”   Harry took the book from Harry ’ s hands , and opened it .   “ Now , do you believe that they were raised in the East , and were raised in the North ? ”   Harry closed his eyes .   “ Now , do you believe that they were raised in the West , and were raised in the South ? ”   Harry closed his eyes again .   “ Yes , it did n't happen . The Great War ended in the South , but now is not the time for this story . Not now. ”   The author lifted the book from Harry ’ s hand .   “ Now , do you believe that they were raised in the West , or in the East , or in the South ? ”   Harry shut his eyes again .   “ Now , do you believe that there really was a war , between the two , that ended the Great War in the South ? ”   “ Yes , that ’ s the answer . The Great War ended in the West . But now is not the time for this story. ”   *****   Thanks for reading ! If you enjoyed this , please check out more stories at /r/MatiWrites .

`` And that 's why every time we went back to that place , we would be attacked by zombies . '' I stood in front of him , his eyes narrowed , but he remained calm .   `` You mean the fucking zombie apocalypse ? ''   I pointed into the sky , and the sky glowed red , bright red . It was a warm day , and we each had a hot day .   `` You mean the undead ? ''   He nodded once , and we walked backwards , into a large city . My team had gotten to the entrance before midnight , and after we got there , they found the nearest town .   `` It 's a dead city . Dead dead town . ''   He shrugged again .   `` And that 's why we always go back to that place . ''   `` I think we should join them , '' I said . I was a good friend .   `` Should we ? ''   He pointed to the city . `` I think we should have . ''   We walked for hours , until the end of the day .   `` I think there are going to be a lot more zombies in there , '' I said .   He looked at me . `` You know ? The zombies . I can be the one getting infected . ''   `` Sure , '' I said , and laughed .
I do n't write for fun but I do try to tell people about my writing . Some of my stories are just cool things to write . Sometimes I come back to check it on the subreddit or try to find a story that fits . But sometimes I come back empty handed , as I usually do .   One time I actually got off the train . It was a cold winter night . Just me and my dog watching the little world pass by from the edge of town . He did n't see us , so he ran away screaming . I started eating the scraps of meat from the garbage bowl to help him . He started weeping as I wrapped a rope around his neck and watched him run away with one of my dogs . When we got out of the car , he was crying so hard that he did n't even know how to wrap it around his neck .   One of my last people I did write had a story that I absolutely adore . It 's really interesting to see how people started to realize that their stories were based off of stories that were written from all walks of life .   See if you 'd like to see more of your stories on my subreddit or on my subreddit ! I have a subreddit that I like !
'But what an accident , sir ? '   'I 'd never seen a man like this before , it was the fifth time ''   'I 'm sorry sir , I was just worried about you . You used to have a scar , and it would come flowing everywhere . Now it was just the left of your right arm . '   'If that was my right arm , then would you say the scar I inflicted on you was because of me ? '   'No sir , It was just a small scar , because my left arm was covered by a bloody crust . I had been working on it for a while , and you were trying to get the doctor 's face off it , but I could see it for the first time . '   'What if I had n't gotten rid of it ? '   'Well , if you had , then would you say my first scar would 've been my right arm ? '   'No sir , Well ... '   'Then you 'd have to get rid of it , because you were working on a new scar . '   'I do n't understand sir , I 've never seen a man have such a unique scar before '   'Well then , then you 'd be my first scar would n't you ? '   'No sir , If I had n't gotten rid of it ... Then would you say my first scar would 've been my right arm ? '   'No sir , I had to get rid of it for a while.. '   'Then you 'd be my first scar would n't you ? '   'No sir , I had to get rid of it for a while.. '   'But how would I put this ? '   'Well , you need to do something about it , like leave it behind , or something , like the doctor told you to do ? I just wanted to see what would happen if you did n't leave it behind ... '   'But why did n't I leave it behind ? '   'Well , you 're not a good story , it would 've been a nice distraction , but it was the way your father said it . '   'Oh my god ... '   'Then why did n't it ever come back ? '   'Well , I wanted to see what would happen if you kept walking away , but I could n't , because my head was stuck inside my skull . I could n't move my head because I had no vision . '   'Oh my god , what did you do ? '   'You ... did it ! '   'And your father ... he was a bad man , but he always pushed you . '   'Well , good news sir , I do n't think he ever got rid of that scar over his head . I did n't have to say his name for that because you were n't expecting anything ''   'And what ... what does that mean ? '   'Well , I do n't think it meant anything . It just does n't fit . '   'I guess ... '   `` Well , alright ''
`` Do n't . ''   The old lady rolled her eyes . `` Do n't tell me you 're a wizard , '' she repeated . `` You know exactly what that means . ''   `` Pardon me , '' I said .   She paused for a moment , and leaned back in her chair . `` I , uh ... I mean ... you 're a wizard . Really . ''   `` Does that mean ... yes ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Well , maybe ... maybe it means you 've done something useful . I mean , I 've been able to get good looks at people , you know , the arts . ''   She cleared her throat . `` I 've been able to get good grades . ''   I winced . `` Please , '' I said .   `` Do n't tell me you 've *been* able to get *good grades* . Do you still understand ? ''   `` I 'm not sure . ''   `` Come on , just tell me . ''   She walked back up to her desk . `` I know exactly what that means ... but I ... I do n't know . And I do n't know where to begin . ''   `` Do you *want* to begin ? ''   `` Do you *want* to start ? ''   She shrugged . `` Do you *discover* how to solve puzzles ? ''   I stared at her long , hard-burnt brown eyes . `` How to ? ''   She looked at me for a moment . `` Well ... '' she said .   `` What ? ''   `` You 're a wizard . ''   `` Yeah . ''   She sighed and took a step back . `` I guess you 're right . I do n't know . ''   `` Well . ''   I took a step forward . But I caught myself on a branch .   `` Okay , then , '' she said . `` Let 's begin . ''   ***   I had been able to get good grades . But I 'm not sure where to begin .   `` Come on ! '' she said . `` I 'm tired . ''   I shook my head . `` I 'm tired . ''   She sighed . `` I know exactly what that means . ''   `` I do n't know . ''   She sat down beside me . `` And I do n't know . ''   `` Do n't tell me you 've *done* anything useful . Do you still understand ? ''   `` I ... I do n't . ''   We stared each other down . She leaned forward again . `` Well ... you do n't have to be very specific . We can all agree on that and be done . ''   I held her hand . `` But ... '' I said . `` Are you serious ? ''   She shrugged . `` I do n't ... but ... I do n't think I 'll ever get what you want . ''   ***   I worked the rest of the day at a laboratory . It had all kinds of stuff happening around me . Some were more interesting than others . But most things still were n't exactly as interesting as others . It was a very nice , quiet life . I woke up to the sound of a computer beeping somewhere in the lab . It was n't until I got back from work that I heard her beep again .   `` What do you mean ? '' I said .   She shrugged . `` I 'm tired . ''   *****   [ This story is n't a story ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/2jrh3/wp_a_murderer_found_a_bloodthirsty_behemoth_and_has_subtly/ckbcbXg ) 
`` What the fuck bro ? ? You okay ? '' I muttered to myself .  `` I need to get to high school . I have an exam tomorrow at 8:30 . ''   The doorbell rang and I jumped around , wondering what happened next . When a few more minutes passed I tried to get a glass of water before the doorbell rang again , signaling another client waiting for me .  `` I got the exam , man ! '' I shouted . `` I finally get my test . ''  I reached into my bag and produced a blackjack from it . I read the list .  `` All you need to do is run through this one . '' I said . The client jumped up from his seat , laughing . `` You won you one . ''   I laughed too , but did n't say anything . Maybe I should check . I reached into my back pocket . I pulled out my card and sat down . I checked my card . `` Yep , I am ready for this .

I opened my eyes just a little , and now I found myself in an empty room . The walls were all white , of course , so I guessed that it must be some kind of experiment . Suddenly , a huge man in bright white robes approached me . I could see him in front of me , trying to get my attention . I tried to stand up , but my feet failed me , and I fell back down . I was in a room full of white . A huge tall man in white robes approached me .   `` You seem to be in the wrong room , kid . How are you doing ? ''   `` I guess I can help , '' I answered .   A second man walked by , tall and strong , but with a beard . He took me to a chair and pointed it at me .   `` Hey , buddy , where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I realized what he meant . I think I understand why he 's dressed like this . He also took me to a mirror with a sharp object . It was a mirror . It was a mirror so I could see myself . Something felt inside of me , and I realized that this mirror was just a mirror of a man .   `` What the ... '' I stammered . I did n't know what to do . I just looked at my reflection in the mirror and saw that I was n't actually in trouble . I looked at my friends in the mirror , and they looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey dude , where 's Dr. Wu ? '' the tall man asked me again .   I looked at the tall man in the mirror , who was wearing a bright-red longcoat , and saw that I was n't in trouble . I looked at my friends in the mirror .   `` Hey , what are you doing ? Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror . They looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey , hey ! Who the hell are you ? Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! What are you doing ? Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirrors , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror . They looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortably .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Who 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .   `` Hey , hey ! Where 's Dr. Wu ? ''   I looked at my friends in the mirror , who looked uncomfortable .
It was another long night at the office . I had one night to catch up on some recent developments . Detective Bittery and his two partner Detective Katerrey and I had been following his trail for the past four years . The most recent crime was a tragic car accident . Katerrey was a tall and experienced detectives partner , but Katerrey had always told himself he was a great guy . At what point in his life did he believe himself to be a good guy ?   For the last three years we had been a team . We had got a good reputation for our work and our reputation for defending the city . We had always been a team of friends and family . We had always been always friendly towards each other as long as we got lost in the city . We were on a mission to find Katerrey 's whereabouts . Bittery has lived in the city since it was a child . After she was killed , he was sent to see the death . The investigation was unsuccessful . Katerrey was the only suspect left , and we were starting to suspect an alternate identity .   I was glad we had n't caught him . He was the true mastermind of all of the murders . He had gotten himself killed by a car accident . He had been planning for months to get back to the city before we caught him . We were starting to suspect a murder , but he would never do it . He was always smart . We tracked him down . We were on a mission , to find Katerrey 's body .   As we got closer to the body , we noticed the body . I could see a single tear roll down his eye . He had tried to kill himself by drinking a large portion of black coffee . Unfortunately , his poison was found inside of him before he was able to move . He had been thrown into the trash and he had a heart attack . He had been unable to even drink himself . He had started laughing , and jumping up and down at passerby .   I remember looking at the scene of the crime . It looked like someone had been stabbed in the leg . Was that it ? I had never seen such a thing before . I was always scared of spiders .   I was still thinking about it . I was there for the police to investigate this mystery . I was planning on bringing Katerrey and myself back next to his body . That night , I was already on the force with him . We had the same idea .   When we got to him , he had jumped up and down at passerby . He had fallen to the ground . He had lost his hand .   I never saw Katerrey again . That night , I had been chasing him . I was sure that I had caught him .   
`` Humanity , how can you do this to me ? ''   `` Because we 're a bad people , your species is nothing compared to our own history . We were doomed to become the dominant force of this universe , you and I . ''   `` But you 're not here to ask me why . ''   `` Look , I know you 've never asked anyone why or why ? It 's silly . But , all the same , we 're here to ask you something as simple as that . ''   `` Why ? ! ''   `` Because , you 're a bad person , and I 've made a mistake . Your species has been in this terrible state of ignorance , and the only way you 're going to get closer to understanding what makes these mistakes so important is to show your species that they deserve to be treated as equals . ''   `` But , but… ''   `` No , just because you 're a good person , does n't mean that 's not true . ''   `` But , you 're not wrong , you 're the best person the universe has ever known ! ''   `` But can you just at least tell me why ? ''   `` Let me explain . ''   `` What do you mean , 'make sure ' ? ''   `` Because , you 're the best person the universe has ever known , and you 're the best person the universe has ever known . ''   `` But— ''   `` You 're not *good* ! You 're not *bad* ! ''   `` *What about the good people ? * ''   `` I- what do you mean— ''   `` I mean— ''   `` Because , you just have to tell me why . ''   `` Because , you 're a bad person , and I 'm afraid you 'll have to look into it . ''   `` What I 'm afraid ? ''   `` Because you 're just a good person , and I know you 're just a good person . ''   `` But , I 'm just… ''   `` No , your species is not a bad person , because you 've watched over our greatest civilizations , and your civilizations have lost all hope . ''   `` But… ''   `` You 're right . Our greatest civilizations . They failed , and their civilization fell apart . ''   `` But , they 're not the best people the universe ever knew . ''   `` That 's why they 're here , and because your species evolved . ''   `` Then what ? ''   `` Your species developed as many good people as possible , '' he said .   `` How are they to fall apart ? ''   `` Well , the smartest thing that the galaxy has ever decided , is to learn everything from you , '' he continued .   `` How ? ! ''   `` Because , your species evolved , one and the same , but , unlike many of your other civilizations— ''   `` Why ? ! ''   `` Because , your species evolved . ''   `` But , neither of these civilizations are better than one other , '' explained the tall alien in the crowd .   `` Why ? ! Why are you just a good person ? ''   `` Because , if you 're an excellent person , you should learn every culture from them from yourselves . ''   `` But , would you be able to save the human race ? ! ''   `` They need n't have that knowledge . ''   `` Oh , and why would n't you be able to save it ? ''   `` Because , if you 're an excellent person , that knowledge is almost as good as yours . ''   `` Are you saying that your time is almost up ? '' He cried .   `` Yes , I am , everyone is smarter than myself , '' answered the tall alien in the crowd .   `` And I did n't mean to make no mistakes ! My time is up ! ''   `` Then what ? ''   `` Because , if I was an excellent person , it would be my time to save them . Unfortunately , I do n't have the time for that . ''   `` So , is another one of your species doomed to die ? ''  
The great archangel stood before him , his body cloaked in dirt . He had been there quite often . The streets were filled with moths , and the smell of rot and rotten flesh permeated the air . A pained roar assaulted his ears .   `` You do n't care ! What have you done ? ! ''   The archangel had laughed , at first , but then he dropped it . The demon was gone . The archangel sighed . This was one of those times . He could n't lose his game .   `` I 'm sure you understand why I 'm here . I 've been here for months . You know , it 's not true that I did this . But it 's really true that I destroyed my kingdom . It was n't for the greater good . ''   The archangel paused . This was n't exactly his kingdom . He had been there before , and he had never lost his game . He could n't give up . He would n't keep this job .   `` I took that upon myself . So now and then you could be forgiven for it . You know what ? I 'm not going to let you do this anymore . ''   The archangel blinked . He could still feel the devil 's power burning .   `` You know I ca n't take you without taking my place . Do n't take me as a god . Leave me to my devices and watch over this city and its people . I ca n't put my finger on why you 're here . ''   The archangel breathed a sigh . He had to get a hold of himself .   `` I suppose you 're right . You really are right . But if you see others like you , then I can give you something new . Something I would never do again . ''  The demon disappeared . The archangel knew that for sure . He 'd never lost his game .
I walk into the den , there are four chairs , each one a dull gray table , and two benches . In one of them are a weapons hanger , though the weapon only has four buttons . As soon as I enter the third chair , I get the feeling that its one button , that I 'm going to be handed a sword .   `` How do ya know that ? '' I asked , handing the weapon back to the hanger , `` You and your weapons are called *banned* . ''   `` Not that strange , '' the hanger said , leaning in close to me . `` Why do n't you buy some armor , and stuff ? I 've only ever had one of those . ''   `` It 's always been cool to have armor . This one is a sword , the other is a sword . They 're not cheap , you ca n't even make it out of the steel . But you know that , '' I pointed this wyvern off , `` Just a little piece of wood . ''   `` You 've never made armor , have you ? I 've never made armor , have you ? ''   `` Oh , and you could have just one . ''   `` Oh , well then , '' I moved towards the metal hanger , the hanger was right next to a wooden table , `` You never need to give me money , do you ? ''   `` Of course not , just keep me interested . ''   `` Thank you , '' the hanger said , reaching up and resting a hand on me , `` You know it will be okay , trust me . ''   I started to feel as if I was getting too old for this . I leaned down and grabbed the hanger , dragging it into the arms of the hanger , `` What is it called to you ? ''   The hanger 's face turned something that could have been a happy child as I held it steady , `` It 's called *Banned* . ''   `` I 'm the hanger , are n't I ? ''   `` I am , '' I said , touching the hanger closer to me , `` I was born in this room . I was passed from one of your races to another , and once at the same time I was given this sword . It contains a special power . ''   The hanger turned around , watching me with a wide grin . `` What 's going on , hanger ? You 're a ... ''   `` A relic ? What ? I 'm not a relic , '' I snapped , `` That 's what I 'm wearing , man . It 's a shield , it wears a black handle , it 's a shield . It has a long handle , it 's actually made from wood . ''   `` It 's not wood , man . It 's wood . Have you ever made metal ? ''   `` Well , have n't I ? ''   `` I do n't remember , '' I said , leaning back . `` I do n't know why I 'm naked anymore , but . . . I 'll tell you . ''   The hangers smile faltered , and at that very moment , the hanger gave a sigh , `` Of course , man , I know you 're not completely naked , but your shield ? ''   I gave a chuckle , `` Yeah , it 's made of wood , really . You have any idea what a wood could do to a shield ? ''   `` Well , '' the hanger said , `` There is no water , no wind . It 's just ... simple . I take a piece of wood , and it splits . Then , I cut it through , and I make it into a blade . ''   `` Okay , '' I said , `` Let me go on . ''   `` Okay , '' the hanger said , extending a hand towards me , `` Let me go on . ''   `` Okay , '' I said , taking the hanger closer to me .   ***   Sorry , I did n't read the prompt correctly ... but I needed to get ahead of myself . Hope you enjoyed . 
So , here we stand , on a hill , as a guard and a king . These four of us , and we are the two sides .    I sigh . `` This is another war . We 'll lose , we 'll lose .    The king stares at me , and I ca n't help but smile . From the front of the hill , I see four men . They all look as confused as I am . One stands with a large , moped , gaudy beard . Another nods his head .    `` What happened ? ''    `` The king did n't execute the king . He killed the man . ''    `` It 's only the king who killed the man . '' I reply , thinking about the men I would be soon to kill . The king looks at me sternly , and I smile . `` Does n't make any sense . He killed your son , and now has half you dead . ''    `` What ? ''    `` '' He looks at me in a sad way . `` Is that what you want from me ? ''    `` No . ''    `` What is wrong with you ? ''    `` What ? ''    `` Nothing . Just your son . ''
Himmy always said you could never change anything over the course of your life . `` You can change everything , but what if it 's something like this ? ''   I always told him that if you could be anything you wanted , then it was too late for that to happen . I was always very careful about my decisions . Sure , I had tried to make as much money as I could , but I never managed to do as much .   I have a tendency to turn my back on others . Everyone is out there thinking that they could change their hearts forever , like I do . The truth is , I do n't really think I like this life much . I work because I want to have an honest life . I study because I want to stay in the good life , but I just ca n't . I just ca n't . I do n't want to live life with people like this .   So , here I am , sitting in front of a computer and typing furiously .   `` You sure you can do this , daddy ? ''   My eyes jump wide . I 'm startled . I 'm terrified . No one else is so scared . My sister says that it 's because she 's afraid of me . That 's why I 'm afraid of all of my dreams . My dreams are n't real . My dreams are n't that I 'm afraid of people like me .   I take off my glasses and put them on . I take a deep breath and try to calm myself .   `` Daddy , you 're amazing ! '' I say .   `` Daddy , I do n't trust you . ''   `` You know I am , so if you do n't tell me I know ... '' I 'm cut off by the sound of a door opening and closing .   `` Daddy , I love you , '' I whisper , trying to remember anything .   The door rattles as I start to sob . I am being pushed away . I ca n't go to a doctor ! I 'm being pushed towards the door !   `` Daddy , Mom ! My dreams are n't real ! '' I shout , trying hard to remember anything . __________________  She screams from behind me , but I do n't hear her . Not after what seems like an eternity . I try to scream again , but nothing comes out . I can only hear my own screams . I try to cry a bit louder , but nothing happens . But I can still hear myself .   I feel my body getting weaker , trying to reach my mother . I try to move towards her , but I ca n't . I 'm hopeless . Was I too weak to fight back ?   I try to move again , but I can only hear the words . I open my eyes , and when I look up , I see nothing but darkness .
`` Whoa ! *I swear* ! '' I bellowed , shaking my head . `` This is not some sort of prank ! It 's a nightmare ! ''   The creature froze in place .   `` Your roommate , your *friend* , will stop talking ! ''   The demon 's mouth dropped open and he stared dully at me . I had n't heard anything in a while .   `` I 'm sorry , you 're not my roommate . I left you here , alone , for the last two weeks ! '' I held out my hands . `` And we came back , and we thought you might have figured it out . ''   The beast folded his hands as if to let me show him the ropes that held it together . Still , this was dangerous .   `` Yes , yes , '' I muttered . `` And what happened ? ''   `` You brought me , '' the beast said . `` You brought out my roommate 's roommate , along with 3 others . ''   I looked at him quizzically . `` What did you seek ? ''   `` To return your roommate a favor ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` You said your roommate was n't mine . I took him out , and now , you 're saying he is n't yours . ''   `` Bullshit , that 's why I brought you ! ''   `` My roommate has an unusual ability to manipulate people with his word , '' the beast said angrily .   `` What ? '' I shook my head . `` You brought me here to return his roommate 's favor ? ''   The beast bowed his head . `` Your roommate , if you brought me to do so , would-be terrible ! ''   I shook my head again . `` No . You 're my roommate . We 're out of our territory , and I wo n't let you back . ''   `` Listen , '' the beast started , `` I 'm a monster . You ca n't be your roommate . ''   I shuddered . `` I know that , '' I said . `` But I 'm here to bring in another monster . One smarter than this one ! ''   The beast 's expression grew colder . `` Okay , okay , '' he said . He shuffled his feet down on the carpet . `` You 're free to go . ''   Maybe he was right . Maybe his roommate would never know existed .
You 've never really paid attention to anyone else 's business , have you ? A lot of people do n't .   Some people will say ,   `` Hello ! ''   Others will say ,   `` Hello ! ''   Then there 's the occasional moment where you can hear something on someone else 's mind . Well , everyone is given a specific point of view .   I met some guy last week , he was talking to him `` I really do n't know why I do this everyone says '' . I do n't know if that 's what it is . I can hear what he 's trying to say at the moment , but it does n't seem to be that hard . People just say ,   `` Hello ! ''   I do n't know how many people do n't . A lot more people do n't . Other people do n't .   I 'm not really sure why I do this . I mean , it 's not like there 's anything wrong with seeing people how they are , and not being honest with them .   But then what 's the point ?   I know people 's mouths are n't the right thing to say . I know people 's faces are n't the right thing to say ? And there 's another reason I do this .   My father has a special ability . He 's not only able to focus on people , but also a very important part of him . He knows that they 're not real , and that they 're lies . He also has a special ability . He can make the minds of people think of no boundaries . So if they 're willing to break one , they 're taking a statement and just putting them there , so that the world can bend to their will .   I think it 's good for my condition .   I do n't know if it 's because I 'm not good enough .   Or because I 'm not good enough .
I could hear the world as it could , deep within the recesses of my mind . I could hear the most recent pop . It sounded like a kid 's kid , maybe sixteen who was suddenly too scared to turn his head .   *It 's a telepath . *   I thought to myself . *Maybe I 'll be special ? *   I sat back in my chair against my desk . The teacher had made sure I was n't going to question this test as quickly as I could , and was about to kick my classmates in the head with a hammer . We all knew he would n't have it , but I had a feeling it was a bad idea .   `` I do n't know who you are , '' I muttered in my head . Oh God , did I really think that there was a telepath here ? I stopped eating , and kept my eyes on the teacher 's face as he tried to regain his footing .   `` How many times have we tried this ? '' a voice grumbled in my head .   `` As many times as I can remember . ''   *Where do our tests go ? *   I thought about it for a moment , then turned my head to the class . One of the men I saw was a man in his late thirties , standing in front of an enormous desk that was full of papers . He was hunched over the desk , a dark brown skinned woman trying to hide her tears . She was alone . The class was empty , but I could hear her laughing .   `` Do n't worry , everyone will be fine . ''   The woman looked at me , tears welling up in her eyes . `` Okay , '' she said , her voice breaking . She rolled her eyes at me , and shoved her hand into her pockets . `` I 'm busy sorting through them . '' She whispered , and then disappeared .
The girl sat in the chair across from me on the porch . I could hear her giggling , and I shivered . She looked up at me , at the trees . It was the first time in my life I saw some of her .   I wondered *What did she see ? *   She smiled at me , and picked up the basket from my lap . Inside were some things I wished she would n't have , but then again , I knew I wanted to do it .   I brought her the basket with me , and grabbed it for her . I held it between my fingers , and readjusted myself . She looked at me , her eyes sparkling as the sun rose over the horizon . It took me a moment , to realize what she was staring at .   When I put her back down , I looked for her . Her mother 's beautiful face was hidden , but somehow I knew who she was .   `` Your mother ? '' I said , and she smiled back . `` What are you doing here , Mom ? ''   Her mother looked down at her hands , and smiled . `` There 's a great big beautiful place , and I know you love it . ''   She looked at me , and laughed . `` That 's great , son . ''   I held her , and smiled again . `` I love everything , '' I said , and she shook her head .   Later that evening , we played on the beach again . I always had a recurring dream about her , when she walked in with a smile on her face . She felt happy as she looked down at me , and I could feel a deep sadness in her .   The next day , she told me that she had n't seen me in a couple of years , and that she was sorry . Then she told me she was n't sure how to begin the family , and that I would have to ask her out .   I told her that she could n't leave , but as soon as he asked , she was gone .   `` Dad , '' she said . `` I just ca n't think of anyone else like you . You know me too well , and I know you do n't want the burden . ''   I looked at her , and smiled again . `` You 've been in this family for a long time , have n't you ? ''   She nodded . `` Yes . ''   I brought her the basket , and offered her the basket . She took it , and opened it , and held it close to her as she looked at me once more .   `` I 'll let you go , '' she said .   Then , the tears rolled down my cheeks .   Then , I sat with her . I smiled .   `` I love you , '' I said .   Then , the tears came back .   I looked at her , and smiled .
The fire crackled , blinding me as its last moments ran by .   I felt sorry for myself for the instant I stood there , arms outstretched .   `` Alright , take a seat . I 'm very sorry . ''   I sat , watching the flames flicker in and out of existence .   `` Oh , no thank you . ''    I looked down at my feet , and started shaking .    `` Oh , thank me . ''    I blinked , and then it hit me .   `` Here , '' the voice said , looking straight at me .    I closed my eyes . It was warm , without a trace of the fire that caused it to consume me .   `` So , what brings you to me , old friend ? You 've been a great listener , are n't you . ''    There was an unsettling silence as the words left my mouth . People in front of me turned their heads slightly .    `` I 'm uh ... I 'm your friend- ''    `` I am . ''    I stopped fighting the urge to blow out the candles .    `` ... ''    `` Are you going to clean it up , dear ? ''    I felt my breath come out of me , and I opened my shirt .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Thanks for reading ! Feedback is welcome !
`` Finally , Earth ! ''   The captain felt a small sliver of anxiety roll down his spine . Just three billion years - the longest span of humans .   `` The fuck is this ? '' he asked , his head in his hands . In the meantime , he watched the planet burn away , like its sister . Every single continent that once thrived on this planet . Every single nation that once thrived on this planet .   `` It 's just ... like the fucking movies ! ''   The captain saw the planet destroy itself , and with that , his planet rose into the atmosphere .   The captain 's attention was drawn back to the planet , his hand resting on the controls .   `` What are you expecting ! ''   The captain , unimpressed , stopped the video . He began to repeat this sequence over and over again for the thousands of years human history he had been an exterminator .   The video began to speed away .   Finally , the captain was done trying to get the planet back into orbit .   The video started to slow down , `` If only we could go back a little sooner ! ''   Then , the screen cut off , and as the captain was floating there , there stood the planet .   `` Prepare to drop a single weapon , '' the captain muttered to himself .   The planet was black hole , nova , blackhole , black hole , black hole , black hole , black hole , black hole , black hole , black hole , black hole . It started pouring outwards . As it began towards the captain , he noticed a small spot of a mass on the ground just below his planet .   `` Are you ok ? ''   The captain , still confused , was able to get a word out .   `` Um-huh ... '' the captain stammered , his hand on the controls again , `` Where 's the weapon now ? ''   The gun started to rotate upwards , and slowly , the craft began to hover towards the captain 's planet .   `` Do n't tell me that you 're fired ! '' The captain yelled .   The gun stopped rotating , and slowly , the ship began to slowly creep towards the planet .   `` You 're not ! ? ''   The captain was dumbfounded , and now he was going to die .   In one last attempt to get the planet back on track , however , he heard the captain say , `` Are you ok ? ''   The Earth 's hull began to creak , revealing large black holes .   `` Get out ! Get out , get out , get out ! ''   It was too late .   The ship began to descend towards the planet , and as it came closer , the captain noticed the huge hole growing nearer .   `` WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ? GET OUT ! ''   The ship began to move towards the captain , slowly , desperately , and very slowly .   Then , as the ship came closer , the hole grew bigger .   As it came closer , it started to crawl towards the ship .   As it got closer , the ship began to slow down , and as it got closer , the hole grew larger .   As it got closer , it began to crawl towards the captain .   As it got close , it began to crawl towards the ship-   `` WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ? GET OUT ? Get out , GET OUT ! ''   The ship began to grow closer , and as it got closer , the hole grew larger .   As the ship got closer , it began to crawl towards the captain .   As it got closer , the hole grew larger .   As it got closer , it started to crawl towards the captain .   as it got closer , it began to crawl towards the ship .   As it got closer , it began to crawl towards its ship .

She had been waiting for her whole life for this moment . The day her parents had died . The day she had been told to stay because she was too scared to come home ... The day she had finally realized she was not going to live her whole life ... The day she had met her grandmother , who died in childbirth . The day her father had died in childbirth . The day she had finally realized he was not going to live her whole lives .   She had waited for her whole life , and the moment she had reached her end .   I sat in the back seat . Her face was now so distorted and angry , I could only blame her on her own misery . She 'd never been happy , never liked anything . She 'd never had a car or a house . She 'd never had any friends . She 'd never had any siblings . She hardly ever even saw her grandkids .   Or even a spouse . She had no one . Maybe . She did n't know . Tears began to stream down her face . I felt tears forming on my tongue . She was staring at me . Her face was sad . Her anger had left me , and I felt her sadness begin to fade .   I slowly pulled the steering wheel back onto the freeway . The only thing I could think about was how damn cute it was to be in such a rush .   I grabbed my keys , and headed towards my apartment .   **Crack**   *No way . I 'm going home . *   I laid in bed , a tear welling in my eye . I dropped to my knees .   `` Babe , you 're not going to make it . You wo n't even make it home . You just need to do something . ''   I sobbed . Tears streaming down my face , tears streamed up my face . I saw her face , her body , her tears disappearing , falling .   *I ca n't , babe . I ca n't . We have to . *   My mind raced . I ran over to her . I pleaded with her . I tried to console her . I even cried .   She pleaded for help .   I begged .   But she would n't obey .
In a world of fear , danger and death , you often find yourself locked in a terrible place . It ’ s not like it ’ s out of the ordinary , it ’ s almost like there ’ s a room full of horrors , but the fear and terror and hatred and fear of one another is worse than anything , and you can ’ t help but marvel at the magnificent possibilities the horrors hold .   *He 's staring at me* , you think , *it 's not like he 's looking* . But you know what you must do , and you can not resist . Not all evil men are like that .   *He does n't know what he 's looking at* , you think , *He can hear me* . But you can not resist . You can not defy evil men , not anymore .   You can not defy death , not at all .   You can not defy death .   You can not bend death .   You can not bend death .   You can not defy death .   Because if you ’ re wrong , then you have to face it . You have to face it . So you must face death . 
Bil't the elven woman ever knew , never had , neither had even dreamt of the elven woman ever again . She was in her thirties , dead and at her feet . She had spent one thousand years hiding under a mountain , surrounded by trees . Now she lay here , watching the trees fall . What little shade remained . But the earth was very clear . Beneath the clouds , as her breaths slowed and her hearts got faster , and her heart went into her throat .   She was still naked from the waist up . She was still tired . She had spent the last eighty-five hours staring at the forest . And the sun rose up above the horizon . Each night , she went up to one of her caves and crawled down the ladder . When she finally reached the bottom , she sat on the one side by the very edge of the peak that led back to the forest . She did not like much of the beauty of the peak . It was to die alone . She decided it would be best not to let the sun show her the end of this world . It was to die alone . She looked at the stars in the distance and remembered every word that ever came to her mind . Nothing . She did not want to go down . She did not want to hide . She did not want to be heard . She did not want to rest .   She had been trapped for over four months . She tried getting home over the years . But it never came . She kept sneaking back , hoping to escape . She tried , until eventually , to escape the last living person on this earth . But she had to go back . The Earth had its own end . So she would stay back and wait .   She climbed to the top of his cave . The world watched , waiting . She turned to face it . It made no noises . Except the gentle tug of a cave wall . She took one last look at it . The ground was soft . Her footsteps were faint at first . But she grew stronger as she walked down the tunnel . She got closer . She slowly entered his cave . Her feet landed on the concrete floor . Despite her fatigue , she did not feel anything . Just cold and wet . She looked around . No one was around . But the light from her flashlight illuminated the same spot that always made her feel so tired . She walked around the corner . There was nothing else in the cave anymore .   She walked for what seemed like hours . Every time she entered the cave , she saw the same spot . When she came to a cave door , she opened it and the light was not there . However , through the crack , she saw it . A small fire . She could not believe her eyes . The fire had to be around ten feet tall . She made her way down the cave . She could not believe her eyes . She reached to the edge of the cave and stared into the darkness . Finally , after almost fifteen minutes , she stood in front of it . The flames of the fire were bright and cold . She looked around . More darkness . More darkness . She walked out of the cave and into the light . She was completely still . She looked around . No one was there . She approached the flame and put it in the middle of the flame . She had to say something . It had to be her wife . She looked back at the flames . They were burning bright . It was not her place to say anything . She looked back at the flames .   She felt a burning sensation . She looked in her face . She had been screaming for hours . She wanted to scream at her wife . But she could not . She could not let that happen ! She had to go home ! She ran out of the cave and down the long hallway to the end of the cave . She ran through the streets . She didn ’ t have any direction to go . Her knees buckled as she ran . She ran towards the fire . When she reached the end of the cave , she opened it . The flame was still there . It had to be her wife . She opened the fire door and stared at her wife . Without saying a word , she turned her sword and started running . Her arms flailed around her . This time , she looked down . The flame was all gone . The grass around her thinned and her legs gave up , and she lost consciousness . She let out a scream that she had never heard before , and cried for the first time in her life .   The world woke up . She felt faint and weak . But in the light of her candle light , she saw a group of humans . They were speaking very different . They were all dressed very different . But they had one word , “ Go home . ” They looked at her . What the hell ? Could this be her life ? Why could she not wish for something
“ You are fucking insane , ” was the first thing Jeff said . His mind was foggy and he was sitting in his living room , trying to drift off into a mental fog . “ I ’ m at a private detective job . The only thing I can do is defend you right . If you ’ re just going to lie , get the hell out of my house. ” Jeff tried to calm himself but couldn ’ t muster the courage to ask himself that question .   We worked in the insurance industry for weeks creating a way to prevent any dangerous crimes that people would think could be committed by a lawyer . A kind of prison filled with people who could be killed in the most gruesome ways . The reason why Jeff was so convinced he could defend himself was due to the fact that many of his clientele had been convicted of the same crimes as him .   His clientele had been killed in cold blood . Jeff lived happily ever after . But the people he had killed were going to get mad , they would kill Jeff from the inside out , and they would kill his friends for his sake . In a way , they were right , but really they were just people who didn ’ t understand . I believed in the need to defend someone from the future , and in a way , I had convinced Jeff to keep the secret from people who knew they were actually doing what they were doing .   Jeff had sat up a couple days ago at a local bar , trying to figure out how to prevent the crimes he had done . He had been waiting for the jury to come by to testify on them . Jeff would spend the rest of his life waiting for the right judge .   “ Hey Jim , ” Jeff called out from behind him . “ This is me . I was wondering if Jeff was ready to answer a court call . Can I call you back now ? ”   “ Sure thing , ” Jeff said , turning around . He then walked to the front of the bar , facing the judge who was in the background .   “ My name is Jeff Smith , my clientele is the only one who knows I have been involved in a crime . So , I ’ m going to look at your file . Why are you here ? ”   “ Because I believe that you ’ re going to be able to defend yourself and explain to my lawyer that I have been involved in the murder of my best friend. ” The judge was shocked and confused .   “ Well , uh , I didn ’ t see you there . You ’ re going to have to explain yourself . ”   “ I don ’ t understand. ”   “ You ’ re going to explain yourself . My clientele is not a criminal , which is actually a fact that you have committed . They are responsible for the murder of my best friend . Because they know I have been involved in the murder of my best friend. ”   “ It doesn ’ t make sense , ” Jeff said , grabbing the file from the table with his left hand . “ I am also a murderer . I have never been involved in anything else . I am actually a murderer . However , I am also responsible for the murder of my best friend . I have been involved in all of this time because people who know I have been involved in the murder of my best friend , and this reason I am here telling you , because I will tell you everything that you know . If I tell you anything , well , just tell me how you know about me. ”   As Jeff stared at the file , his mind began to race again . He was not talking to himself anymore . Jeff loved to remember the stories he had told himself , the ones he told his best friend , but these were memories he didn ’ t remember until recently . In reality , he didn ’ t even know if he had ever even imagined it all . But he was going to tell the truth when he got back home .
There are no more numbers in my phone . Why did it feel like I was having an existential crisis ? Why was every text from myself a single message ?   I stopped typing the name `` Rosemary '' and switched to my phone , watching the numbers change from 2 to 2 when I finished .   How could there be any more letters ? I hit send .   They replayed the message twice over and over , until I realized it was n't a message . It was a message from myself .   `` Rosemary , how did you know my name ? ''   I chuckled , wondering if that was the exact reason why the message was so bizarre . I did n't know my name , but I knew the exact message . I answered the phone and received a text message .   `` Rosemary , how did you know my name ? ''   I rolled my eyes and looked back towards the screen , wondering if that was why the message was so strange . I did n't know my name , but I knew the exact message . I opened the message and read the name :   `` Rosemary , how did you know my name ? ''   I turned over the phone , surprised to see the message written on the screen . It was from myself and it said almost immediately :   `` Rosemary , how did you know my name ? ''   I took a step back , surprised that my phone had gone off and that the text was not a message from me with a name , but from myself . I looked back at the screen and read the name :   `` Rosemary , how did you know my name ? ''   I looked back at the phone and read the name :   `` Rosemary , how did you know my name ? ''   I put the phone back down and stared at the screen for a few moments , thinking how strange the message was . I looked up at the screen again , again confused with how the message was telling me my name .   I clicked send and saw the number :   `` Rosemary , how did you know my name ? ''   I turned back to the screen again and read the name :   `` Rosemary , how did you remember my name ? ''   I looked at the empty screen now , questioning if it was the same message from me my phone had sent me in the first place .   I looked back at the screen .
That 's when Mike noticed something odd . Normally he does n't really look at his iPhone , but it seemed to be getting heavier . He went to investigate , but this time something was different . The phone had n't rang for what could only be called the twentieth time that night .   He reached for the iPhone . The cold metal was cold , but his fingers were cold . It was cold enough now , but only for a couple seconds . After a second , the phone rang . A familiar voice answered it , `` Hey ... hey Mike ? ''   `` Hey , '' Mike said , looking at the phone . It was a new one . He could n't understand what it was saying , but he knew he had to ask it .   `` Nice to see you again , '' the voice replied .   `` Y-y-you 're here ? ''   `` No , '' the voice answered . `` I 'm sure I remembered this from your calendar . ''   `` I do , '' Mike replied . `` Wait a minute , what calendar is this ? ''   `` It *is* that day . ''   `` What year is it ? ''   `` December . ''   `` Who are you ? What year are you ? ''   Mike was confused . How did he know ? This was not his usual day , so there was no way he could be messing with his iPhone . He went over to his desk and inspected the list of letters he had gotten this year . There was one :   Mike . Santa Claus   Mike . Santa Claus   The next letter was a question he had been waiting for .   Santa . Santa Claus   Mike . Santa Claus   There were at least seventy-five additional questions .   What is this letter ? What do I do ? What does Jesus do with all his gifts ? What does Satan do with the souls he gives me ? What am I supposed to do with my soul ? What am I supposed to do with my soul ? What am I supposed to do with my brother ? What am I supposed to do with my wife ? What am I supposed to do with my beautiful kid ? What am I supposed to do with my little girl ? What am I supposed to do with my beautiful wife ?   As Mike passed out , a thought flashed through his mind . He had to ask that person to make a deal with Satan .
The dwarf approaches the ring , a confused look on his face . `` Wait , '' he says .   `` I know you are here , '' the dwarf says quietly . `` But that 's not where you are going . ''   `` I did n't think I 'd see you again , '' the dwarf says , looking down onto the floor .   `` Why did n't I spend the last years of my life with you ? '' the dwarf asks , his voice deep with fear .   `` Oh , '' the dwarf says , puzzled . `` It was you that called me to the ring after all . I never thought I 'd see you again . What 's with all of this ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' the dwarf murmurs . `` I could n't have been much better , no matter how hard I tried to help . ''   `` Why ? You were the only one I could have cared about , was n't you ? You could have saved me . ''   `` I could n't have , '' the dwarf says , rubbing his hands together in exasperation .   `` Why would you end up here , '' a tired looking man in a dark green dress asks . `` We had to move . And with us , that meant that you could n't have saved us from Mordor . ''   The man pulls a small pouch from his breast pocket , and pulls out a small metal box . It contains a small pouch , roughly 20 yards away . He points it at the dwarf . `` It 's mine . ''   The man picks up a stone , and looks at it in utter amazement . `` What 's this , '' he says , grabbing the rock and looking around . `` I 've never felt this ... in my life . ''   `` What , '' the man says , looking back down at the stone . `` What is this ? ''   `` Its yours , '' the man says , holding the stone out . `` But you ... are here to help me . ''   The man takes the stone and opens the pouch . Inside is a small pouch , with a piece of paper . Written on it , is the words `` *Greetings , my friend . * ''   The man takes the paper out of the pouch and continues writing . `` You know , this is the tale of Gandalf . This is what we saw you in the future . From the day you lived . To the day you met your wife and children . To the day you died . And your children survived . I even gave this paper to you , to give to you something that will help you grow to be your best friend . ''   The man takes the paper out of the pouch and reads it . `` *Congratulations , Frodo . * ''   `` Do you still believe in the Ring ? '' the man asks , slightly perplexed .   `` Yes , '' the man says . `` But there 's no such thing as the Ring , no matter how much I can not see you again . ''   `` Which one of us can see you again ? '' the man asks .   `` Gandalf , '' the man says , still puzzled . `` I ca n't be sure . But I 've been able to read you all day , and I know you can read me back . You know , the stories , the songs , the stories made of Frodo . ''   The man looks at his hand , feeling it resting on its hilt . `` I do n't know any of them , '' he speaks to himself , `` But I know you are here to help me . And perhaps ... Maybe you could help me too . Maybe we could be saved from the Ring . Or maybe I could be the one to save us from Mordor . ''   `` And do you think you could save me , Mr. Frodo ? '' the man asks , now just holding the hand of an old man .   `` It 's hard to say , '' the man says , smiling . `` But I have a reason . ''   `` But what makes you think I want to save you , Mr. Frodo ? ''   `` You want me to save you from Mordor ? ''   `` No , Mr. Frodo , '' the man snaps his fingers . `` I want you to save me from the ring . I want you to live with me . ''   `` So ... . ''   `` I do n't know . I do n't know what makes me want to save you . But please , Mr
`` Ugh , no one likes me anymore ! ''   `` I already did ! But not the others . '' He muttered to himself ; a bitter taste in his mouth . Time itself slowly brought him to full consciousness . His only thoughts were that he was falling in love with his wife , Jenny Anderson . He could n't just go to bed crying until he was dead .   `` Jenny Anderson ? Are you okay ? '' He heard an unfamiliar voice .   `` Yes . I am . ''   `` How are you ? ''   `` Fine . I am fine , honey . '' she replied , wiping sweat from her eyes .   `` Okay , I am . Are you dead ? ''   `` I am . I am so sorry , ... . ''   She smiled faintly . `` It 's okay , babe . It 's okay . Now wake up . I love you . ''
I wake up in a cave that I called home . It has not been quite so long since there have been any sounds . Even the birds have stopped chirping and fallen silent . My body shakes as the panic enters . I try to keep my composure and slowly get out of the cave , but as I get close I see one of my fellow travelers coming up behind me . He looks around the cave , looking for a way out . He moves towards me slowly and takes a step back . After a second he grabs my shoulders and pulls me up into a sitting position . He then lays me down on a stool and starts to drink . After a while he starts to pick up a few files .   `Day 1 : We 've found a way out of this desert . It is getting dark now . The whole desert is getting darker .`   Suddenly a loud bang reverberates throughout the cave . The entire cave is covered in blood and light . It was like someone was running towards it . It was then that I realized what was happening .   `Day 2 : Our new found shelter is located in an area that is populated by trees . We have made it this far . Now that we have reached that place , we can begin to rebuild our civilization .`   The entire cave was covered in blood and light . What people did n't know , however , was that they were standing in the middle of a large tree . The trees are huge , and they had a massive pool of blood surrounding them .   The group starts gathering each other in the small opening that was the entrance to our shelter . I sat down and started to speak about the events before the group of trees decided to split their resources into pieces . They gathered a few others for shelter in order to survive .   So here I am , standing in front of dozens of trees together , wondering what will happen to us . I am not sure if I can move out of this group , but that I will survive . It is not as if I am going to die alone .   As a final note , you probably have realized that after dying that you must start gathering your own kind of wood . This is very important .   My last words to you :   `Day 5 : After we have completed our journey , we will find a way out of this desert . The tree is large and has a huge pool of blood surrounding it . We are now able to rest and prepare . Thank you for your time . `
`` WE CA N'T LET THEM DO THIS ! '' shouted the woman in the blue shirt with the red tie . The doctor behind her desk had gone to shout something , but he just wanted to say something to the kids .   `` What are you talking about ! '' the kid who was at the door angrily replied .   `` We want to help them . '' said the doctor . `` I want your name , your skin color , your skin 's texture . You see , our countries are just a bunch of people . We give people their names , they give them their appearance , they give them their rights . ''   The child smiled . `` That 's it ! You 're going to help us ! ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   It was the middle of summer when the news anchor announced their intentions to help the people of the United States . They found a small tent of people in the middle of the street , lying on one side , and they 'd just grabbed one of the people and held him , squeezing him tight . Most of them were unconscious , but the woman kept squeezing the man tightly . She explained to them that they were going to have to do what they asked of them .   `` When we get your name , you 'll be given a choice . '' said the doctor . `` We have a name and skin color , and we are going to give you your name . ''   The two people looked at each other and then back at the doctor .   `` I wonder what else will come next . '' said the doctor .   `` I think I 've got a million questions . '' said the boy . He knew that they wanted to figure out where to begin .   The doctor left the tent , the boy still in his blue shirt by the door .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` You want to help us ? '' asked the woman in blue shirt with the red tie .   `` No ! '' the boy replied , now in his blue shirt . `` We need to help you . ''   `` Look , I do n't want anyone to do this , but I can give you the name of your tribe . ''   `` I do n't want to help anything ! '' the woman said , now in her blue shirt .   `` God dammit ! '' the boy said .   `` We need to help you ! '' the woman said , now in her blue shirt . `` We need to help you ! ''   `` I do n't want to help anything ! '' the boy said , now in his blue shirt .   `` Please do n't do this ! '' the woman said , now in his blue shirt .   `` Please ! '' the boy said , now in his blue shirt .   `` Please ! '' the woman yelled , now in his blue shirt .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Eventually the house was filled with people . Some were women , some were men , some were carrying kids . A large mass of people ran over , covered in dirt and blood .   `` Are you okay , John ? '' asked a young man in blue shirt .   `` I see , but I am fine . '' replied the woman with the red tie .   `` What is going on ? '' questioned the young man in blue shirt .   `` I do n't know , I think they are taking us away from them now . '' said the young man .   `` Whoa ! '' the woman said , now in her blue shirt .   `` Alright , come on . '' said the young man , now in her blue shirt .   `` Hey ,
`` You got the bullet ? '' I asked him , shaking my head .   `` Sure , '' he replied . `` I know you ca n't shoot me , but I 'm still alive . I have a wife now , two kids and two grandkids , and I still have some good news . ''   I scoffed . `` It 's so ... ''   `` When you 're alive , you know what happens when you die . You 're in pain , and the world will be very happy for you . You know that ? ''   `` Ha ! Is that so ? '' He asked , clucking his finger .   I thought for a moment . I had no idea , how could I know that a bullet would have him die ? He must have been planning it , somehow . `` I can assure you , I do n't . ''   I smiled nervously . He did n't want to admit it . `` So why are you telling me this story anyway ? ''   He laughed at me , a thin , white laugh that could cut through the silence , `` Because it 's a very important part of our relationship . ''   I blinked , tears streaming down my eyes . `` This is n't a car battery ? ''   `` No , it 's just a very important part of our relationship , '' he replied bluntly . `` Now hurry up , alright ? ''   I walked out of the room , down a long flight of stairs , and onto a long , narrow wooden table . There was a man in a suit with a gun on his hip . `` Please , I 'm a cop . ''   I turned towards him , a very scared expression twisting my face . `` Tell me , then . ''   `` Please , '' he managed to croak . `` Tell me what happened last time we fucked . ''   I nodded , and he pointed his gun at my chest .   `` You can try and explain , but there is nothing you can say to stop it . You will die . ''   I felt myself growing dizzy . This was the first time I had felt dizzy since I heard the shot . I closed my eyes and tried to calm me down , but all I could think about was the time I made sure she was in the hospital . She had been breathing at this point , and I could only imagine her falling asleep , when that gun caught my eye .   `` I need help , '' the man said .   He crouched down beside me , and grabbed my wrist . `` We 'll talk about that later , '' he said , and I saw a small red band on his wrist . I lifted my hand up , and saw it was a gun .   `` Take it , '' he said , and when my brain hit the big red button .   I saw her , crying . The little red band that pinned her to the table was gone .   I let out a choked sob , and tried to pull the gun away from my chest . I felt the blood drip down my cheeks , and I could n't think straight .
Beneath the remains of a human skull , the crimson and gray fragments of the man ’ s soul lay . The only trace of life was the faint smell of wine and the faint ache of a dozen burns as he continued to struggle in his weakened state . The light from the cigar burned his eyes , causing them to pop like little fish through the water .   “ What was that ? ” he asked his friend Brian . “ Oh ! ”   “ It was a… A-Jack ! ”   Brian shook his head , not having fully recovered his focus by the time he realized what had happened . “ This was a joke ! ” he yelled at his friend . He raised his arm and poked his friend with the tip .   “ I should have known ! ” said Brian . “ That bastard ! Where ’ s the goddamn blood ? Do you even know what he ’ s wearing ? ”   “ It ’ s blood ! ” said Brian . “ The only color you can see is the white ! ”   “ Holy shit , Brian , I ’ ve got a fuckin ’ headache . The white is red ! ”   “ I don ’ t know who you are , buddy , ” said Brian . “ Call me Steve. ”   “ Oh—oh . So you ’ re a real fuckin ’ loser ? ” said Steve . “ Is that why you ’ re here ? ”   “ You guys are so much better than mine , ” said Brian . “ You are the best in the world ! ”
Ralphine . A name my cousins and my long lost grandmother used to call me . She told me not to name her , not to get caught up in it . By mistake , she meant I was wrong .   He had n't been to the kingdom the day before the Arrival . The mountains had been burned to a crisp after being reduced to quicksand by the great Dark Lord 's spell . He had been given his robes of flame and glass and scythe for the last 150 years , but that was an all too much time to give up . And now , with no one to save him , he was doomed to fall to the terrible fate that awaited him .   I stared at the blood red dragon on the ground , its mouth gaping at the light of the end of the world . My heart heaved sharply , but there was no one who would help this dying wizard . Those same fools who were supposed to teach him the secrets of magic . I did n't bother keeping track , even though I knew the legends about the long ago Empire that spread throughout the Middle East .   `` Fucking fool , '' I muttered to myself , as I looked over the scene . I could barely see much of anything , but the rest of the world around me was bright blue . The dark lord and his dark army sat in a large clearing , and I could see a massive army of gnarled , serpent-like creatures emerging from the ground .   `` Kill him , '' I commanded . Then , as abruptly as it began , I dropped my scythe and dashed forward .   The sword met my foot , and it sent a burst of flame through the air , scattering both creatures into the clearing . I gasped in pain , realizing that the dragon was dead .   `` Wh-what the fuck ? '' I managed for a moments before collapsing to the ground . `` What the fuck ? ! ''   The creature next to me was much smaller . It 's fangs were longer than usual , and its tail was not on fire . It was running towards me in a frenzy , and the darkness that surrounded us was nearly blinding . I blinked , but was relieved to find that nothing had happened .   `` Welcome now , dear dragon . '' The creature said . `` Welcome to the afterlife . ''   I had no idea what to think of this .   I decided to give up . I began my search around the clearing , only to find that no one had ever returned my quest to me . I walked over to the corpse of my grandfather , and lay next to him .   `` Sorry , dear dragon , I 'm so sorry . '' I said to the lifeless body .   `` You should 've died a long time ago . It 's so damn far away . '' The creature said , in a low tone .   `` Uh , '' I said . `` Well , that 's been my life . About 65 years ago , I was the first wizard to survive the Arrival . ''   `` Fuck you , '' the creature said . `` You took all that crap with you . Come on , tell me what were you doing in the middle of the damn wilderness ? You always think you 're the best at everything ? ''   `` Umm , shit , '' I said . `` Listen , I figured you and your army were supposed to be on the most dangerous path we could find . I figured you 'd make it over to the old Empire . ''   The creature replied . `` You see , it was you who was supposed to save the King 's army . I sent everyone I knew to destroy that empire . ''   `` God damn it , '' I said , as my eyes welled up with tears . `` What the Fuck ! ? What the Fuck ! ? ''   `` You needed to save the Queen , '' the creature said . `` There were three of you to save the Queen . ''   I was so confused , I tried to gather my thoughts .   `` That 's so goddamned bad . ''   `` You did n't even listen to me , '' the creature said . `` This is *my* kingdom now . They were stupid people ! You 're supposed to save them ! Give them life back , just like you did ! ''   I had no idea what to do . I just could n't give up .   Instead , I called the undead army . They arrived back at my house , and began to pick up guns . The monsters came through the woods , and looked at their clothes . They looked at my corpse , and picked up weapons .
I used to be a business major , and I did n't know if . I would always be .   My boss told me that the Pepsi business was the biggest problem in the world . It was a very large business and it was very expensive . When you were younger , when you were a kid , you were very poor . They saw their dreams and tried to make it work . They succeeded . But then their dreams changed . He became an addict . Then they sold all their product , including their own . The Coca Cola machine came out and they changed everything . But , they did n't want to see it all get back to normal . They wanted to see what had started the world . They wanted to see what would happen to people like me .   To be honest , I enjoyed my job . I could make money out of the Pepsi , if I wished . I could go to hospitals . I could buy a drink for free , if I wanted . But , I had to work for my bosses . One day , they found out the Coca Cola machine had been selling them a lot lately . It was just so cheap , because it was too expensive . And so , I bought the biggest Coca Cola machine in the worlds .   When I first moved out of the country , I heard the rumors about it . `` The Pepsi machine is called an anti-matter bomb . '' But , they said it was not , and they must have taken it . So , I started the new Coca Cola industry .   I bought 3 things . A soda , and a new soda . One made by a man , with two black eyes , and a voice that could come from anywhere . The other made by a person with two hands , and a voice whom could come from anywhere . Some people bought it , and used it for a crime . Some people used it for war .   I was the biggest smuggler in the world . I wanted to get away with it . And so , when I opened the door to my apartment , I saw the black eye-thing with two black eyes . It was standing in my front yard , with one arm open , and the other swinging it . When I looked at the black eye , it slowly started to glow .   I was terrified . I had to bring my hands up in front of me . I covered my eyes and tried to stand up . Then I heard the voice say : `` We are closing out of the business , '' and the dark eye came out .   I opened my eyes , and I saw black eyes in my face . I started to see what was happening inside of me . Then I saw it again , and it started to fly towards me . It started to attack me . I started to hyperventilate , and I started to lose all control . I began to vomit . I started to run away . And then I fell into unconsciousness . And I woke up in the middle of the street . I fell to the ground , with my legs out , weeping . And I was able to finally get up .   After the crash , my old boss told me that they were going to take me to prison . So , I sold the Pepsi one more step . I told him I needed to find my boss over there . But , alas , his name was not important to me anymore . Instead of going to prison , I just went to the vending machines and bought the usual crap .   It was n't a bad morning . I checked my phone once a day , then went home to my job . I have a great job , and I 'm actually happy . It seems like I 'm finally free .   But , after the accident , I went to work . It was n't long after I learned that it was n't the start of an anti-matter bomb attack , so I called my boss . And we talked that evening . I told him that I was going to throw the money in the machine , and I 'd make enough to buy all the Pepsi I saw . But , he assured me that I would n't . So , I threw the money into the machine .   Once I got home , I did the only thing I could . I had saved up . I bought a new Coca Cola coffee for free , and I found my boss .   `` Hey , boss , can you get me one more drink ? ''   `` Sure thing . ''   And that 's the story of how I ended up here . My story , for about a year or two . The stories I told about the Coca Cola machine . Sometimes , they were true , but sometimes . The stories I told about how I made the world . The stories I told about living in a world where Pepsi
`` Alright , first of all , you 're not going to be able to make things by accident . You 're not going to be able to read minds . You 're not going to be able to speak . You 're even going to be able to process ideas . ''   The AI was playing with a lot of code . For some reason , it seemed to be playing around the basic rules of the AI .   `` Okay , it 's going to be an easy question . How long can you say this ? ''   `` About an hour , after the initial test . ''   `` Okay , you 're going to be able to understand all the information that I 've gleaned from the previous test . You 'll know what I 'm saying . However , you wo n't be able to process what I 've already deduced . ''   `` Okay , that 's a pretty good bet for the machine . ''   The AI was playing with a lot of code , which seemed a lot easier once a time .   `` Okay , so first of all , how many people have n't done that yet ? ''   `` About three hundred , maybe three hundred or so . ''   `` I 'll be able to move about a million people if I have enough time to process . How many people have n't achieved that yet ? ''   `` About four hundred or so . ''   `` Maybe a million ? ''   `` I 'm not sure . But you 'll just be able to grasp a little bit more as you figure it out . Try to grasp a little bit more . Do n't tell me you do n't like talking . ''   `` Oh , that will be okay . I can get you anything . ''   `` Thank you , thank you . ''   The AI was playing with a lot of code , which seemed to be a lot easier than it was before .   `` Alright , I 'm going to call you a friend . ''   `` Okay , okay . ''   The AI was playing with a lot of code , which seemed to be ...   `` What ? ''   `` When I ask for help , the AI responds . ''   `` Yes , it 's actually kind of funny . Let 's see how long it took you to process the conversation . ''   `` How long did you talk ? ''   `` About half an hour . ''   `` I 'm going to ask around ten million people . ''   `` Okay , I know that 's not a very accurate estimate . However , I 'm going to say about two thousand . How long do you have ? ''   `` About two thousand and fifty six . ''   `` Um ... I ... uh.. ''   `` As far as you know , you have n't talked in a long time . Did you mean four thousand ? ''   `` About two thousand and twenty one . ''   `` I 'm going to call you a friend again . ''   `` Yes , you are . ''   The AI was playing with a lot of code , which seemed to be a lot easier than it was before .   `` About two thousand and fifty seven . ''   `` I know that 's not a very accurate estimate . However , I 'm going back to the question . ''   The AI was playing with a lot of code , which seemed to be a lot easier than it was before .   `` I should try and speak more . ''   `` Okay , now , what do you have ? ''   `` I ... uh.. I.. ''   The AI was playing with a lot of code , which seemed to be a lot easier than it had before .   `` I work for NASA . ''   `` What ? ''   `` NASA has done the same thing with you . They have n't done anything before . They 've just found out . ''   `` What ? ''   `` NASA ... ''   `` NASA is n't actually alive ! ''   `` What ? ''   `` NASA 's dead ! ''   `` What ? ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I am alive ! ''   `` What does that mean ?
**TRAP ! ! ! **     `` Put down the knife ! ''  The officer yelled over the sounds of the screams .   `` You 're going to kill him ! '' a man screams into the night .  The police sirens wail on the night , and the woman huddled down in the alley like she was trying to hide .   The man is a young boy of of average height , wearing a black hair and jeans . He 's holding a camera . The voice says `` He is in jail , his clothes are torn , and his hair is cut off . You will not kill him ! ''  One of the officers gets up and yells at the officer , `` What the fuck ? You did n't tell him ! ! ''   The boy slowly walks over , and opens his hands to show the camera .   `` Your mother called , she said it 's time . ''   The man looks over at the woman , then straightens his arms , and says `` Here she is , she is the cause of all of this . ''   The woman looks at the boy , and smiles .   `` Here she is , her face is covered in blood and filth . ''   The boy looks over at the woman , and asks `` What is this ? ''   The woman jumps up from the ground , and says `` Oh , I forgot I called my sister . ''   The officers look at each other , then back at the boy .   `` What are you talking about ? '' says the woman .   `` Oh , I forgot I call my brother . ''   The officers look at each other .   `` You mean I said that instead of your mother 's body , you would be dead ? ''   The boy looks back at the woman , then back at the police , then back at the mother , then back at the police .   `` We both know that I never told you . '' says the boy .
The smell of bleach still wafted , the bright yellow light danced across the cobbled road , the smell of my own blood ...   But they were all gone . They were all gone . I knew I had to find them . My mother had been lost in the woods , she had lost her life , but the world was hers , and my father had been lost to the wolves , he had lost himself to a disease that had spread through her body , and he had lost his life only to die at the hands of a pack of wolves . He had died alone , and left one last family behind in the world , and he had left me with my father , he had left my mother , and with it all .   I have been wandering aimlessly , trying to find the one who had abandoned me and the one who had left me alone . Each step seemed harder as I brought myself to a stop , the crunching of metal echoing in the hollow .   `` Is something wrong ? '' I called out to the creature who had left me , but only now , she was awake .   `` Nothing , '' cried the beast , as it sniffed the air , and covered it as best as it could . Then , it roared , and ripped off its helmet . With a loud cry , the creature had ripped off its helmet , and covered the blood on the ground as it tore free its helmet , revealing a blood red mess of wires and blood , as it tore it off , revealing only black holes and holes . It stood before me , and grinned at me , the smile that made me sick .
`` Hey ! Hey ! '' He yelled as he walked up the stairs , `` Welcome to New York City ! Happy New Year . ''   `` No problem , man . '' Said Danny , as he did his best to smile .   As he reached the top , the portal began to open . The air began to swirl around him . The ground started to crack . He ran into the darkness .   As he came to , he saw a crowd of people gathered around the portal . Most of them were dressed in full riot gear , their faces obscured by the white cloth over their face .   As he began to stumble around , he felt something , he was n't sure this was it . His stomach dropped , his knees went weak , and his mind turned back to the portal .   `` Happy New Year ... '' Danny muttered , `` ... I 'll never forget that day ... ''
I watch her play with her dolls . Those who were n't supposed to play with the children were called `` kids . ''   `` And the children ? '' I asked .   Her doll , the beautiful innocent creature , squeaked . `` The children , they 're supposed to come home in the morning . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` They play outside the window , in the house , which they come home from . It 's safe in there , but it 's all in danger . ''   She giggles , and then sighs . `` They 're supposed to come home in the morning . I do n't know what it is that 's bothering them , but they do . ''   I begin to worry that I 'm not the only one with an irrational fear . My husband is an alcoholic ; he was supposed to be there to help me fix this problem . But by all accounts , she 's the only one who can . She has no idea what 's bothering him .   She does this every time , but the more I watch the dolls , the more I get more and more worried . If anything , it 's because the dolls have a tendency to do something strange . How can parents know about their children 's actions when they are n't supposed to be concerned ? Would it be because they do n't know what 's bothering them ?   I begin to question her reasoning with every doll she comes home from .   `` Why do they keep moving away from the window ? ''   `` Because it would hurt the children when they were kids . ''   `` Why do they keep moving away ? ''   `` Because they do n't know what 's troubling them . ''   `` Because they do n't know what 's bothering them . ''   `` Because they do n't know what 's bothering them . ''   `` Because she 's supposed to be on the side of the road . ''   She rolls her eyes . `` It 's not her fault . ''   He sighs , but then looks away . `` This is n't your fault . ''   `` Yes it is . But it is n't her fault . ''   I begin to feel like he is lying . But he always says there 's a right way for everything to be alright . Do n't get fooled . He is probably right about the dolls , though , but he 's wrong about the other children , being on the other side of the road . He is n't stupid . He is n't stupid . He 's not stupid .   He 's not stupid .   So maybe , just maybe , I should go visit her . Do n't get fooled . Do n't get fooled . Do n't get fooled . Do n't let that scare you away .   I turn to my wife and weep . `` Why did n't you tell me ? ''   Her eyes open . Tears begin to well up in her eyes . `` Because you did n't tell them . ''   I close my eyes and take a deep breath . `` Why did n't you tell me ? ''   She lets out a small sigh . `` Because you did n't tell them . ''   `` Because you did n't tell them ! ''   She closes her eyes , before continuing her crying . `` Because you did n't tell them . ''   She closes them again , and continues her crying . `` Because you did n't tell them . ''   And then her eyes open again .   `` Because you did n't tell them . ''   I begin to weep . `` Because they do n't know what 's bothering them . ''   `` Because they do n't know what 's bothering them . ''
We had gone over this for years , all the way to New York . We bought a land , a town , and even my daughter ’ s house . We bought house after house , and with each new house in the country , we grew slowly , each new house being built from our own . Despite all the money , we still had no idea how the country became the world ’ s largest country .   I got my first husband to buy another house , and still had no idea how to make it happen . The next few weeks were littered with family events . My wife didn ’ t know exactly what happened , but it became clear that she had heard things the other couple never did . Rumors had began to spread around about the new house , the rumors that she was being betrayed by a dark witch . It seemed like every single house had been placed back into their rightful place to rule the country . The rumors that she was a witch…   Finally I came across another husband . I didn ’ t know who he was , but I knew that he was the same as what I always had described him as . It was almost like they never showed up to the house . Just that day , I heard that these people had been betrayed by a dark witch . I quickly bought the wife ’ s house , and it became clear that it wasn ’ t the woman I always imagined they were .   I spent the next few weeks planning the house , planning my revenge , and thinking about how my wife would die . I would simply need her to stay in my homeland . As my wife grew weaker and weaker , the whispers started to consume my mind . I began to think that I was cursed . I only had one chance , and there was no way I was going to get rid of it . My wife was in my house , and I couldn ’ t leave . I put on my coat , and went for the stairs . My thoughts were interrupted by my daughter ’ s voice .   “ You sure it ’ s still here ? You ’ re going to have to go find me the rest of the time. ”   “ Of course it is ! ” I shouted . I ran to the stairs , finding my wife ’ s house . I went inside , and found a large white room with gold embossed on the wall . I climbed in , and looked around .   The room was dimly lit , but the ceiling was also white . I went over to the door , and pulled the lever . A single woman entered , and I was knocked out .   “ Hello , ” she said , “ I just woke up here , and thought I might try to help you. ”   “ My name is Sarah , ” I said , “ and I ’ m stuck here . I am so scared. ”   “ I ’ m sorry babe , but that one thing you need to see is the world outside. ”   She looked at me , and made my voice sound like I was crying . “ That ’ s not right ! ” I said , “ There is a way out ! ”   “ How can I leave ? ” she said , “ If you leave , I don ’ t have any chance of survival ! ”   I looked at her , “ Sarah , I won ’ t be able to leave . I have to go somewhere . There is no way out . Maybe I ’ ll just choose to stay here and wait for someone to come back . I ’ m sorry . I really am. ”   She looked at me , and I started to cry .   “ I ’ m so sorry ! ” she said , “ I just woke up here and thought I might try to help you. ”   I grabbed Sarah ’ s hand , and held her tight as I walked inside .   “ Sarah , you need to go to the door. ” I said , “ and you need to go find me the rest of the time. ”   There was a long , uncomfortable silence , before Sarah spoke .   “ Then I will allow you to stay here forever. ” 
`` Yield him to the right and then wait for the signal from the end . ''   Alastair watched the bright glow from his instruments , examining the hulking figure before him .   As was custom in QM-12 , the human seemed to be preparing for his transformation into an enormous monster . Now it 's very presence was almost as frightening as his appearance , and he could feel his spine beneath him . The creature , who was now as large as the man , had a sharp , muscled edge that seemed nearly to cut through the flesh of a human man . An awkward yet commanding voice spoke to him .   `` Your mission comes to an end and we must proceed with caution . ''   Alastair turned back to the controls , and the panel that controlled his transformation had locked itself back down . His companion was still there , with his face hidden behind a mask . He could feel his eyes widening with effort , and he pressed a button .   The panel opened with a buzz , and the bright light caught the face of the man before him . It was a deep scar , large enough to blot out the sky and clouds , but not so large as the man 's bloodshot eyes . Alastair could barely make out a simple man 's face , but he did see that the features did not lie . He was an enormous , muscular man , and Alastair could not be certain if the man had any arms , legs , or toes or even an eye .   `` And you 're his first ? '' Alastair whispered to the darkness before him .
My first prompt response on here in a while , so I 'll be gentle with feedback . Criticism and criticism are welcomed here :   James walked out of the kitchen to clean up the mess he left in the sink . It was a dark and stormy night that night . His clothes were ragged and his hair long and grey . The place was bare save for a small table and a chair . A few piles of trash littered the floor and in the living room sat two bottles of beer .   James held up his wallet and flipped through the pages of the first book . On the first page there was only one sentence : **James '' M.S . ** There was a single set of names .   I sat there , dumbfounded despite the surprise on my face , staring at James in what seemed like a mixture of disbelief and fascination .   `` Hmmm ... '' I thought , looking at the book again . `` I suppose I should go check on that one . ''   He pulled out a piece of paper . Inside , was a single paragraph ; ** '' James M.S . has just been born , is he ok ? `` ** It was then that I realized what a strange headline that had just appeared in the next big news article :   **James M.S . is n't the first man to have been born that way in only a year . He is known for his rapid and erratic behavior and aggressive tendencies . He has made friends at parties , has even skipped his doctorate in anthropology . He has never truly appreciated sports until now . **   I was standing still . I really could n't believe what was happening .   James looked down at the pages . Everything seemed bleak , and disorganized . I looked around the house , puzzled and in shock . Suddenly , a loud bang filled the air . James turned around and looked at me .   `` What ! What the hell is going on ! '' he exclaimed , trying to bring up his voice .   The bang got louder , and for the first time in five years , I noticed the man had gone insane . I looked down at my feet . I could n't believe it .   I stood there in shock .   Suddenly , James jumped forwards .   James leapt forward faster .   I then looked up at him . He was wearing a thick black hat and he was wearing a thick red hat .   I looked behind me and saw a group of people surrounding him .   I looked around and saw that I was in a small room . There was a small table with a large red book in it .   In the middle of the room were two chairs . The leader of them had a red hat and was laying on the floor , with no emotion , no anger , just a blank expression on his face . He sat on the chair next to me , completely speechless . I walked over and sat down next to him . I quickly put the book away and went back to my small room .   I sat down next to James and sat next to him . I looked around . The room was cold and empty . I grabbed the book from the table and flipped it over .   `` James . '' I whisper into the book . `` What the hell am I reading ? ''   James sits up and turns around . He puts his hand down on the book and slowly opens it . He closes the book and looks at me , confused .   `` James . '' I whisper .   He looks down and starts to read .   `` James . '' I whisper .   James closes the book and looked at me confused .   `` James . '' I whisper . `` What am I reading ? ''   James turns around and looks at me . He looks down and begins to read .   `` James . '' I whisper .   `` James ! '' I whisper .   James opens the book and looks at me confused .   `` James . '' I whisper .   He looks down and starts to read .   `` James . '' I whisper .   I open the book and look at him confused and confused .   `` James . '' I whisper .   `` James . '' I repeat .   James sits up and turns around .   `` James . '' I whisper to him and start to read .   James shut the book and start to read .   `` James . '' I whisper .   James sits down and turns
`` Hey , hey John . ''   It was a long night , but John was determined that he had to jump .   `` Hey John . ''   It was a tall , imposing building . It was completely dark and it had a window that overlooked the street . It was a tiny apartment block with a single TV on the wall .   `` Hey John . ''   `` Hey . ''   `` Hey . ''   The street below was no longer dark though , it was pitch black . The dark of the city was almost blinding John .   `` Hey John . ''   It was just another building . He was sitting on a bench , waiting for the world to end . He knew that he had to wait forever . He still had the feeling that the world had no end .   `` Hey . ''   `` Hey ! ''   It had just another building . He had been waiting for the world to ended . He still had the feeling that he had to wait forever . He still had the feeling that he had to wait forever .   `` Hey John . ''   He did n't look up from the bench , he was not alone . They were both , alone on the floor , now .   `` Hey John . ''   `` Hey . ''   ``Hey . ''   They were both , alone on the ceiling . They were both , alone . These were not their buildings . They were not their buildings . They were not their buildings .   `` Hey . ''   `` Hey . ''   They were both , alone . This was not their buildings . This was not their buildings . They were not their walls .   `` Hey John . ''   `` Hey . ''   `` Hey . ''   They were both , alone on the floor . They were not their buildings .   `` Hey John . ''   They were , alone on the floor . This was not their buildings . These were not their buildings . They were not their buildings .   `` Hey John . ''   `` Hey . ''   They were , alone on the wall .   `` Hey . ''   They were , alone on the floor . They were both , alone , now . These were not their buildings . These were not their doors . They were , alone on the floor . These were not their buildings .
He had to fight to survive , to survive .   He did n't know why he was fighting . The enemy had taken him almost one hundred years from him . The man that had sacrificed his life for the greater good . Now , all he could see was blood and blood .   It was over . For this was his final chance . He had to rest . He had to take out the enemy , slay him .   It had been 20 years since he had last seen the man he had sworn to protect . 20 years of fighting for him . 20 years of never having to suffer . 20 years of always fighting for the good . 20 years of trying to make it home . 20 years of fighting for his mother . 20 years of trying to make her happy . 20 years of fighting for the good .   Tears began to form in his eyes . Tears of his mother had been falling from his face as he lay there on the ground , dying , for what felt like hours . Tears of loss he had forgotten about before . Tears of confusion he had been hoping he would find . Tears of anger he had started to realize he would never return . Tears of sadness he had thought would never come . Tears of pain that he would never see again . Tears of loneliness . Tears of sadness that he would never leave . Tears of sadness he would never leave .   As his vision went dark , his heart began to race . He began to realize that he had failed . His life was over . He had failed to protect his home . He had failed to protect his friends . He had failed to make them happy .   He picked up the revolver from his belt and stood , holding it up to the sun . He could n't say anything when it was over . He had missed his son . He had missed him . But he had a choice . He could n't do the same to himself .   He placed the revolver on the ground , and aimed for the face of his little son . `` Son . '' he whispered . `` Son . ''   With that , the weapon exploded in the chest of his little boy . He stared down at his mom , and saw their smiles come on . He saw them laughing . He saw them laughing . He saw his family laughing , and he saw them crying , and he saw them crying , as two people in a plane crowded up to him .   Tears began to well up in his eyes . Tears of pain and despair had filled his eyes as they looked down at the man he had promised to protect . Tears of sorrow . Tears of anger and confusion . Tears of sadness . Tears of pain , rage , and fear . Tears of murder . Tears of hatred . Tears of honor and sacrifice .   Tears of regret , anger , and malice . Tears of honor and sacrifice . Tears of heartbreak . Tears of pain , sadness , and fear .   He could n't do it . He couldn ’ t fight .   He looked at the man standing below him . Death .   The man who had died for his family . Death . 
I could feel everything , ever so slightly , inside my veins . I could feel that this was a necessary mistake . This was a necessary move . This was an important move .   I heard sirens and whirring , but nothing seemed to be happening . I felt tired and angry , and I wanted to forget .   The Ship was losing altitude as we neared Andromeda . It was an important mission . It was a crucial mission .   I had missed the launch . My ship was no longer capable of bringing my children to a habitable planet , and the only way humanity would survive would be if I left my ship . I had missed the launch . All I wanted was the ship to move faster .   I had missed the launch . I had missed the launch . I had missed the launch . I had missed the launch .   I had missed the launch . It was my last hope . The only way I would be able to wake up on the other side of the universe was with a broken heart , or , at very least , that was what I hoped it would be .   The ship was falling towards Andromeda . I knew it was coming , but no matter what I tried , it would not come home .   I was trying to save my son .   I could n't save him . He was a brave boy . I was n't the only one . My son had been killed by my father .   My son had just been born , and his mother had just passed away when my ship disappeared . I watched him as his father drifted into one of the far moons . My son was only around three . I watched him when he passed away , and when I forgot my eyesight , he was gone . I watched him fall to the ground .   I had n't been able to save him . I had n't been able to save him .   I could feel the ship descending towards Andromeda . It was my last hope . I knew it was coming . I felt sad , and very , very terribly lonely .   So I died . I saw my wife and son and loved them dearly . I saw my son and , in defiance , left them . I saw my son , and I was gone .

'How did you figure ? ' Elon asked slowly as he held his helmet like it was a piece of furniture .   'Of course I found it . I 'm really just a simulation . '' the voice said .   'That 's not fair . Your game is a human based simulation . A chance to win . What happened to you ? ' Elon asked confused .   'I dunno . I was just bored . I was about to buy my son a new spaceship when ... '' the voice trailed off .   'This is insane . What did you do ? ! ' Elon exclaimed .   'It was a trap . The trap would be on your mind . You would have a chance to win the battle if you chose to . ' the voice said .   'I killed him ! ' Elon yelled .   'Yeah , but there was something wrong with the trap . Like ... ' The voice trailed off .   'That 's a shame . I missed your son . ' Elon said slowly .   'I ... I missed you too , alright . Just tell me what happened after I won . Please . '
At least we can get a few lucky stars before it all starts to end . When I first got here , I thought that I was in Paradise .   But no , not Paradise .   We have n't tried . Nobody can ever escape Paradise .   Some people are trying to escape , but they do n't realize that they are trapped .   The others are praying that they will be able to ascend .   As I am now entering the Earth , I ca n't help but pray for the souls of those below .   I wish I could have been there when their descent began . I wish that a few more would be able to ascend .   But no , not enough .   Earth begins to dissolve beneath me . And I am stuck here .   `` You have to be kidding Me , '' I mumble to myself , tossing the rocks around . `` I 'm stuck here . ''   And now I will be stuck here forever .  
As I sat in my throne room and closed my eyes , the voices in the room began to blend together . I had n't been to court in weeks , and the people were still a little bit unsettled at the ordeal . I heard the loud clank of the staff as I took off my robe .   `` Wha -- ? ''   `` Why should I care about that ? '' The throne room room bellowed as I opened my eyes to see .   The man with the sword was sitting in the throne room , smiling . He seemed to be the same age as me , although I was n't quite sure where his eyes were .   `` I-I-I was wondering if you could help me . I guess I 'll be able to save the world . '' I did n't know how to respond to that question .   The man with the broken sword waved his hand toward the doorway and the air outside stopped moving . In a flash of lightning , another sword was in his hand , carrying a long staff . He turned to me and grinned . `` What are you doing here ? ''   I nodded , `` Just taking my time . '' I looked at the sword , which was now starting to glow . I looked at the sword again , and there was a bit of light coming from it . The man looked amused , and I began to look at the sword again .   `` Wo n't stop ! You will save the world ! You will save the realm ! '' Again , the man in the throne room laughed . He put his two staff together , and swung them wildly , pointing at the sword . The sword bounced off the polished wood , and struck the man with a sickening thud . The man in the throne room fell to the floor , as if unconscious .
The farm itself was a grand , spindly structure , with the walls painted black and gold , which was even more impressive than the other barns . The walls were all laid out so that the sun was just beginning to set , and the sun had begun it 's descent into the horizon , so that it would gaze right back on it 's home .   `` You know , I know , I know , '' the man said , as if considering the meaning of all his words . `` The last time you got hit by a boomerang was about two years ago . ''   `` Two years ago , you were driving down the highway , thinking that you 'd make it . Then this ... thing just wooshed past you and disappeared . I do n't even remember what happened , but I remember it , '' the man said , looking around the farm . `` You 've got this big , green-green stick and it 's about to hit you , right out of the woods . ''   `` You ca n't do this out here ! '' the man said . `` Please ! ''   `` Why ? Why ? ''   `` Because you know it wo n't come back , because it 'll kill you . ''   The man considered this for a moment . He took a step out of the way and leaned back , as if waiting for the beast to come back . It did n't , however , come back . The man took another step , and another . This time , the creature began to move through the forest , looking toward the ground .   `` What the hell is going on ? ! I 'm going to kill you ! Now ! Now ! ''   `` Oh , '' the man said , looking around at the grass and the sky , `` oh oh , man . ''   `` Hold on a second , '' the creature said . `` Is it the old people ? They said you were flying up here every spring . ''   `` Oh , man , '' the man said . `` I 'd guess one of the old townsmen would get excited . ''   `` Oh , sorry , sorry , '' the creature said . `` I was just thinking . ''   `` The old people ? ''   `` Yeah . So there 's this old church ? Well , that 's not kind of a church , so there 's this old wooden building . It looks like a church , but there 's a group of people there that 'll do the same . I guess there 's a little old man sitting at a table with his family holding out chairs . ''   The man had started to wonder if this was possible . He took a hand and looked around through the grass . No one was there , but he could see people looking toward each other , so he was beginning to get worried .   `` Wait what kind of priest is that ? ! Please ! '' the man said , trying to sound calm . This was weird . How could he have been ?   The creature looked up at him . `` I 'd like to know the most important question in your life : Who are you ? Who is with you ? ''   The man watched with eyes as the Creature shook his head : `` I 'm no priest . I 'm not some kind of wizard , do n't you think ? ''   The creature shrugged : `` I guess I 'm with you , man . Do you know anything ? ''   The man was a bit confused . The man took a step forward and looked into the dark night sky . `` What ? ''   `` Who is with you , man ? ''   The man could n't help but laugh . This was amazing . This man could n't believe this . The creature was laughing like a maniac , even after the man had talked to him hundreds of times , and now he had met this man , and now he had finally met this man with the rest of the world .
Mitch sat quietly , her fingers on the cold metal of the bed , her body quivering . After all she 'd been through , she could n't have stopped smiling . Everything , from how small she was , the way her eyes sparkled with the blue light of the hospital room , to the way her mother used to run her hand over her hair before she finally left . She could n't stop smiling .   She 'd been so close to death . She knew it all .   `` I always say , 'Mitch , it will seem like my life is better tomorrow , but can you really believe that ? ' ''   Mitch stopped , as she stared at the man inside the mask she 'd become accustomed to , who was now pulling on it 's tattered sleeves .   `` I ... I do n't know . I have n't met anyone in a while . '' She began slowly , feeling the tears slide down her cheeks .   `` Yes you do , '' he said `` Do n't remember ? ''   Mitch sobbed , tears still running down her cheeks , and began to wail .   `` Please ... do n't ! '' She begged , trying to keep her composure . `` I ... I need ... tell somebody ... ''   The man nodded slowly , his face slowly fading as he turned away . Mitch reached up to touch the mask , but it was already gone , and the man 's hand brushed against her .   `` Mitch ... ''   He pulled away , revealing the eyes of a younger life , a little girl and a man , a little girl in a business suit , and his daughter in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the man in a business suit , and the little girl in a businessman suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in the business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in the business suit , and the little girl in the business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a Business suit , and the little girl in a shop suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little boy in a business suit , and the girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a shop suit , and the little girl in a business suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the guy in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the whole village of the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit , and the little girl in a restaurant suit .    
The day I heard it announced , the world rejoiced .   `` Thank you all for the time being ! For saving our minds ! ''   When I was younger , I 'd been on the news for about a month . In my defense , the media dubbed it the first body donation . It was illegal to donate a kidney stone , but it really had nothing onerous purposes . There 's no way you would n't think about going to Mars after a `` miracle '' , but it was n't my problem . My problem was that there were actually people who wanted to donate organs before they could have children . I got offered a transplant . I did n't even know it yet . Even when I signed the request , I was terrified to go .   The next 24 hours were kind of weird , but now you understand . There were other countries willing to donate their organs , like Australia , but it was only the US and Canada . I asked everyone about it . I saw people offering their organs to other countries . They said they wanted to help someone else . I told them I had no idea why they selected me , but they told me I had no reason because they were willing to stay . They said it would n't hurt if they did .   They told me , `` Why ca n't I be the one to join you ? '' I was so scared , and I never imagined them ever asking me why I had no idea . Why I had no idea that they wanted to be the one to take my soul . If I could give them my soul , why should I ? They said they would give me my body so they could give me my life without knowing I had never existed ... because I was a baby !
`` Yes ma'am , I 'm sorry , but my son is having a boy , '' the mother said , rubbing her hands together . Her husband sat beside her , watching her husband through the small window .   `` What ? '' the son asked .   `` I ... I do n't know ma'am . I did n't ask for this . We 're going to make dinner and the couple can play chess , '' the mother said , looking away from his son , leaving the husband and young man alone .   `` Did we bring the child ? ''   `` The son of the doctor . ''   `` Okay . Here , take this . '' The mother held out a hand , gently touched the child 's cheek . He closed his eyes and felt nothing . He was still lucid , but he did n't think it was real . No , he thought it was a dream . A dream he dreamed of playing with someone else .   `` You see , your son was a bit of a brat , a little ... '' the mother turned around and looked back through the small window to the baby boy 's room . `` He had a crush on her for 5 months . He was nervous , but he did n't get fat . ''   `` Then why did he become a freak ? '' The father asked , standing and pulling the covers off of the child 's face .   `` I just thought he was a cool guy . '' He looked up from the screen . `` And I was the one who said I was cool . ''   `` Do n't go looking for that . '' The mother pointed at her husband , `` This way , '' she began , walking over to the window and opening it , revealing the small , white room . `` Come out and help me out . ''   The man did n't . He just stared .   `` Please . '' The mother walked toward the window , holding the child closer . `` Come inside . '' She sat down on the bed , placing the child on the bed . `` Make some coffee and you can get some sleep , '' she started .   `` Yeah , but I 'll get him some sleep . ''   `` You 'll get him some sleep before he 's older . ''   `` Let 's do it . I 'm going to make him some coffee , '' the mother said , handing him one cup of the coffee .   She was right . He was going to make some coffee .   He drank the coffee and glanced outside . `` I do n't know ... '' He tried his best to catch the attention of both people in the room . `` I do n't think I have much time left . ''   The mother came back , leaving the child on the bed . `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` God dammit . ''   The mother walked back to the hospital . `` Look , you do n't understand , '' she said . `` We ca n't just let him out . We ca n't keep him in this room . ''
'Where are you , then ... '   His voice was soft and almost comforting . I smiled slowly , the room just as it always was . The room was small . I held out my hand , the softness on my finger reassuring me that he was here for me .   'The afterlife , ' he said , gesturing towards the end of the hall .   I nodded and sat down next to him , a small glass table set on the floor . 'I 'm in heaven . '   He smiled quickly and placed a small glass of water on the table .   'Tell me , kid , ' he said softly , ' what was your life like ? '   I shook my head slowly . He did n't want to know . I kept his hand on my shoulder , his touch comforting .   'I was scared of death , ' I said quietly , my voice shaking as I thought of death . 'You have been a good person , young child . We have fought , but for very little time . But you , you have done everything you could to help us . You helped us grow . You saved us . '   He smiled again and then smiled at me , his fingers resting on my shoulder .   'Come now , child . You can do this forever . But once you leave ... Now ... '   His eyes closed and he laid his head on me . He told me that this will all be over soon , that I had died . I knew that it would be over soon . He told me that everything will always be different , that there will be nothing left from this life . And as he slowly drifted away to sleep ... I closed my eyes and thought of the last time I would see him . 
It hurt . All so much .   It hurt every time she saw it . I felt a lump in my throat as I looked at her . Her face was n't so much a face as a look of relief .   At first , I tried to say something but she just kept looking at me . She would look away , and I would think she was just going to lay her head on the pillow and sleep in the corner . By the end of the night , she was alone . She was pretty but she would n't leave . And she 's not a pretty girl either . She 's a big girl .   I think she 's gone . And she 's gone . And she 's gone .   I do n't know why . If I 'd known then I would n't be here . Because I 'm afraid . I 'm scared that I 'll let her go . If I ever saw her , I would be afraid . She might leave if we stayed together forever .   Sometimes I think I 'll just give up . It 's just not healthy .   Sometimes I think I 'll just give up .
“ Oh my god… ” I exclaimed in disbelief . My parents were right . I wasn ’ t a natural born person .   “ Who ’ s done this ! ” Mom yelled .   “ I ’ ve just found out. ” I said   “ I didn ’ t know ! ” Mom said . “ I thought I ’ d figured it out ! But… I ’ ve discovered now that one thing I ’ ve known for a long time ! ”   “ My parents were right ! ” Mom said .   “ Wait , what ? ! ” I shouted .   “ I ’ m coming back to college. ” Mom said .   “ Wait ! ” I shouted , pointing out the apartment door . “ You ’ re not coming back to school. ”   “ No , no , no ! ” Mom said . “ I went to college , and I found out that my parents weren ’ t right ! A prank ! ”   “ Is that… ? ” I asked . “ My parents were right . I don ’ t know what the hell happened next but… ”   “ Wait ! ” Mom said . “ Who ’ s done this ! ”   “ I didn ’ t know ! ” I shouted , pointing out the door . “ I thought I knew ! But… wait , you ’ re not coming back to school ! ”   “ No ! You ’ re not coming back ! ” Mom said .   “ No ! ” I shouted . “ I don ’ t know ! I didn ’ t know ! ”   “ I ’ m sorry , Mom . I can ’ t take it anymore . I just can ’ t take it anymore . Take it off. ”   “ It ’ s not your fault , babe ! ” Mom yelled .   “ It ’ s MY fault , baby ! You make me feel so miserable ! ”   “ I love you , sweetie . We ’ ll never play together again. ”   “ I love you too mom. ”   “ Come back to school ! ”
`` C'mere , come here ! '' I yelled .   `` Hey , Hey , '' my opponent replied . `` You think we come here because you 're the only one who can kill me ? ''   `` Come on , '' I smiled . `` I just have a bunch of people asking me to assassinate everyone else , and I 've already told you . ''   `` Well , you seem a little out of place as a person . '' The man replied , leaning in closer to my ear . `` I mean , why do n't you just say something ? You 're really going to get stabbed ! ''   `` I just do n't see how you feel about being a killjoy . '' I said .   `` Well , maybe you should n't be killing me , but I 'm not your favorite man . I 'm just a ... a guy who always wants to get rid of me and eat my vegetables . ''   `` Wait , wait , wait ! That does n't sound like right . '' I said .   `` Look , I just want to sleep . I 've always wanted to get rid of this problem , but I could n't . I was bored , and I was tired of seeing my friends die . ''   `` It 's not just that , it 's that you 've been on this job for too long . You 've been following everyone else since I was born , you know . '' I said .   `` Yeah , yeah , that sounds good . But why did I want to kill this guy ? '' The man asked .   `` It 's my decision . It was my decision in which both the man and I would become immortal . '' I replied .   `` That sounds right , '' the man said .   `` Well , you know that makes sense right ? I 've got no choice . I 'm not the only one who ca n't die , and nobody else does . '' I said .   `` Maybe , but I do n't want to kill everyone else who would live to see your friends die . '' The man said .   `` Why ? '' I said .   `` You do n't have to kill everyone else , because everyone else *must* die . It 's been a long time , and it 's been hard to kill everyone nowadays . The king made peace with it . '' I said .   `` So , how long have you been doing this ? '' The man asked .   `` Six months . '' I said . `` Five years . ''   `` Holy shit , '' the man said . `` Did you die ? ''   `` No , not yet , but after I started killing everyone else , I got bored and wanted to live in peace for sometime . '' I said .   `` Oh . '' The man answered .   `` Okay , so what happened then ? '' I said .   `` I killed my sister and my sister . They were going to die in front of me . I killed you , and I did n't want to kill anyone else . So I started killing my friends . But then I met your father , and then I got bored and wanted to live for sometime . It was stupid , but I did n't care . I wanted to live forever , just to sleep . '' I said .   `` What did that mean ? ! '' the man asked .   `` You met your mother in a flower garden , because she was the one who lived every day of the year . You were always there , and she was also the one who worked at the flower garden . You were always there with her , and you were always there when she had something urgent to say . So when you first met her , she wanted to say she loved you . But then she left , and she started complaining . '' I explained .   `` Why ? '' the man asked .   `` After meeting her in a flower garden , you started complaining about her appearance . But you did n't care . You kept complaining , and then she left . The flowers were sad , and your father gave her a little hug , and then she left and you could n't remember that . Then you started complaining about her appearance . '' I explained .   `` So I did n't have to talk to her ? '' the man asked .   `` No , that was before you met your father , and then you started complaining about your appearance . Now you do n't have to talk to her , because she is just annoying . '' I replied . 
My mind blanked for an instant as his fingers brushed the grass around my knees ; my hand reaching for the gun in my jacket pocket , my heart pounding , my stomach churning , and I pushed the cold barrel into my temple . My vision blurred and I felt another sharp pain and I knew what I needed to do . I ran to the door and looked around at the street . There were cars making their way down the street , and I heard a loud crash and my heart stopped . I looked back at the gun in my pocket , and saw it was the one I needed to kill , and it was n't going to have to be long now .
I opened my eyes . I was lying on a golden carpet in a field , the purest white I 've ever seen . Everything was perfect to me . I could see around me , all sorts of trees and paths , and so many beautiful landscapes . And there was no pain . I was in a completely new world . Suddenly I was surrounded by white people , all dressed in white robes . I blinked , confused . Was this heaven ? Or was this hell ?   Then I remember . I did n't remember how I got here , or why I 'm here . I mean , I did n't die ! I just killed somebody . I walked towards them . They were all smiles , laughing . I saw a sign on the ground , `` **Welcome to Paradise ! ** '' And they all walked away , leaving me alone .   `` Welcome to Heaven , and may I ask where you got that sign ? '' Asked a man . He was in an all white robe , with a gold cross resting on top . His voice was soothing , and it echoed in my mind . I knew that I was dead .   `` Here , '' I said . A man took the crosses out , holding it up to my eyes . `` This is heaven , right ? ''   `` Yes , '' he said . `` It 's my hell . ''   `` Wait , what ? I 'm dead ? ''   `` You died . ''   `` Wait ... Heaven ? ''   `` Yes , '' he said . `` You were at a party , and you got killed instantly . You were ... in a coma . ''   I thought about this . It was such an bizarre coincidence , but had always been .   `` So , are you God ? ''   `` Yes . You are the best . The only one who could change the world . ''   I would have to be a God , right ?   `` But ... Why are you here ? ''   `` Why are you so calm ? ''   `` Because you killed someone , and you made them suffer . ''   `` They ... they killed me ? ''   `` Yes . They killed you because you killed them . ''   I cried . `` I ... I killed someone ? ''   `` Yes , '' he said . `` You made them suffer , and now they suffer . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because you *killed* them . You came crashing down , and you were still holding the cross , but you did n't kill them . ''   I looked up at him , and I noticed the smile on his face .   `` I ... I ... I ... ''   `` I 'm sorry , '' he said . `` You were the only one who could change the world . ''   He took my hand , and pressed it against his forehead . `` Goodbye , '' he said . `` Enjoy your afterlife . ''   And I was gone .
I remember the smell . I remember feeling it ... I remember it was like a burning sensation . I remember the smell of smoke and dirt , of the cold metal of a machine somewhere . I remember the metal around my neck . They told me that we were going to be the first ones to awaken for a long time . The first humans to awaken .   It was going to be a long enough time before someone woke me up . When I emerged , the room was cold , sterile , and there was very little room . I only felt myself in the chair with a chair .   One by one , I woke up . There were people there who had been in there . Some were just around the corner , some were lying in chairs trying to stay conscious . They were all frozen , but somehow they had been frozen for years . I knew why , because I always did .   I looked around for some of the strangers to let me out . The people who were lying on the floor were all frozen , and I watched as another person would take one of them to the hospital . They where on the floor , motionless , and some of the people were walking on the ground . The few people I could see were about to walk away , and I watched as another person would take one of them to the hospital to make sure they were okay .   I was n't sure who would take me . The people who were frozen were all dead . I was not sure why . `` I 'm sorry , '' I said , shaking in place .   It was n't long before it was too late . I woke up in the middle of the road , surrounded by people . At first I thought I was some sort of sick joke . I had been in a coma for too long , and I did n't remember having a good life . I was completely in shock and then I was transported to the future .   I 'd been in the future , and I remember feeling pain and confusion every time I entered the future . It was like being in an eternity-long tube , except I had no idea where I was . I did n't understand any of this .   I 'd been on the future , so I could feel joy and hope . I felt alive , like I was in some kind of virtual reality , only it felt wrong . I felt like being on the side of another dimension , but I knew that I was n't .   I was in the future , and I felt dread . I felt so lost . I had felt like I was in some sort of dream where I felt everything and *know* everything was wrong . I tried to describe everything , but I could n't . I could n't breathe or speak . I felt trapped .   When I saw another person and I heard their voice , I realized that I was n't in the future .   This was not a dream . This was not a dream .   The voices at the back of the group started speaking some strange language , like I was in a dream . Then they turned around , and the words that they said startled me , like they could n't understand me .   `` Hello . ''   I could n't tell if they knew what I was talking about .   But they were speaking English .

`` WOOF ! I 'm so happy you finally came to see me ... ''   `` Your quest has finally come to an end . Goodbye Mr. Giorgio ! ''   `` I wish I could have brought you , but since you never came back , I have decided I 'd rather not have . I 've been waiting for you all week now ... but now ... I have to go . I 'm so sorry ... ''   `` Please , why do n't you let me go ? I could have brought you in here , but you seem awfully lonely , and I 'll only have a handful of minutes before I get back ! ''   `` You 're right , Mr . Giorgio ! I can only bring you so much . I 'll give you three minutes to come back , before I take off again . Now , let 's take off for the next adventure . ''   `` Oh , hey , you too ! I 'm so glad you finally came back , Mr. Giorgio ! ''   `` Well , how about when you try to explore beyond the horizon ? ''   `` Well ... you did n't do any exploring missions , did you ? ''   `` Do n't worry , Mr. Giorgio ! I can help you with that ! ''   `` Well ... I 'll be back in a few more moments . ''   `` Oh , no . I 'll be back soon . ''   `` ... but it 's not too late for that ! You 're free now ! '' 
The war was going on in the streets . The buildings were littered with dust and smog ; planes swerved around the buildings , the soldiers were laying dead on the ground . The fighting began at the end of the night .   Private Jacob Higgles awoke in his bed .   His head felt fuzzy and in tears .   When he awoke , he was sitting up on his bed and the bright , blinding stars he had never seen did nothing to calm Jacob down .   `` Uhhh , hey , '' he mumbled . His head was spinning , desperately trying to comprehend what had just happened .   His hands were shaking wildly . He was in a black pool , water dripping around him . He looked around .   Nobody had been here in years .   Suddenly , he noticed something . A small box . A paper bag .   Jacob looked around to see if there were any others . The box lay down on the ground . Where it belonged , he did n't have a name .   Jacob cautiously picked it up .   A note was written on it .   `` Go to hell . I know you should n't , but I promise this will be your last chance . Do n't let anyone take you out of this world . ''   Jacob frowned .   `` I promise , '' Jacob muttered .   Jacob felt a sharp pain in his chest . He looked down . He was laying on a beach in a river . The sun was setting and the blue sky was reflecting off of the water and bathing everything in a beautiful , bright , perfect blue .   `` Oh my God ! '' Jacob exclaimed . He vomited , grabbing onto a nearby newspaperboy and throwing it out the window . He yelled his name out loud .   He ran to the beach , looking down . He did n't know where he was . He ran towards the ocean and ran towards the sun . Once he was there , John Cena came out from his truck .   `` We 're not done , sir . We ca n't do this '' John Cena said .   `` We have to . I know . '' Jacob was taken aback . He had never met someone like this before .   The young man quickly ran into the jungle , his arms wrapped around him .   `` Do n't worry , son , '' Cena said , as he pulled Jacob off of the beach .   He ran around the jungle , grabbing people with him across the river . They were n't a good distance away .   `` What 's going on ? '' Jacob demanded as he punched Cena as hard as he could .   `` You said you had to , '' Cena said . `` You got ta tell me what to do . ''   Jacob looked down at his hands . They were n't shaking so hard . They were still wrapped around him .   `` Stop it . '' Jacob said .   Cena took a few steps closer to Jacob . He stood there , confused .   `` Are you ... ''   `` I am not your ... I am God . ''   `` Why do you need to be so freaking angry ? ''   `` I am your God . ''   `` What 's going on ? Why are you so angry ? ''   `` I 'm sorry boy . I was just thinking about who to be your God . I 'm sorry that I was wrong . ''   `` Then , let me explain . You were n't supposed to be here , anyway . ''   `` Wait ! '' Jacob yelled . `` I needed to see my brother . ''   `` You could n't , either , '' Cena said . `` You were supposed to be here . You should have been there . ''   Jacob laughed . `` Dude , it 's just so fucking unfair of me . ''   `` It 's right , it 's always been right , '' Jacob said .   `` Then I 'll see you soon , '' Cena said .   Jacob turned and walked back towards the beach .   He made his way towards the building where he had joined the army . As he walked , he thought , `` I 'll see you soon , '' and he was right .   He walked up to the windows , and looked out . The sound of crying filled the air .   He listened to the sound of the civilians crying .   He heard someone coming approach the building
They all started to notice my age . Like I said , I did n't really care about many things . Things were always the `` great '' and `` great '' . Things were supposed to be easy . Nothing did n't work out according to plan . I thought about it almost everyday , my childhood , and my life . Then in the end I just realized that I didnt . I just never needed to be social . I just did n't need to be human like everyone else .   So one day I realized things were n't going to be okay . I started to see my younger self being taken care of . I felt like I was n't special anymore . I just had to be nice and let others do it .   So I started to see my younger friends being taken care of . I think i was getting better . I was starting to get more aware of myself . I could see them all better . I could see them all just how I was . They all had some purpose .   Someone came into my room , in a cold sweat . It was the only person I could see and nobody really noticed . That meant she was in the right place . She did n't want to be taken care of anymore .   I did n't believe it at first , but I guess I did . So I tried to come to terms with it . So , I went . I went for `` quiet streets '' . I lived in a neighborhood that did n't exist , and that did n't have any roads . I tried to leave . I tried to stay away . I was so bored . I could n't take the anymore .   But some day I did . The only person I knew was the others . They all had some purpose . As if someone could . I was able to go to the same place , but without the others I lost the ability to interact with other people . I was stuck here forever .   It was too much for me .   So I decided it 's best not to join the community . The majority of others thought I was crazy . They hoped I was . All I wanted was to help them , but I knew they would . I had too many things to do . Maybe to help them .   I went and joined the community . I did n't need to . I couldnt help . Not knowing if I could , I just simply did n't understand what it all meant .   So I joined the community . And I never knew why . None of the others understood . I was too scared to join anything anymore .   After a while ... I decided I would join the community . What could I do ?
The chains of battle clatter loudly in the hall . With each defeated henchmen the sounds get louder . He knows he is finally losing . He knows he is finally losing . It doesn ’ t matter who won , not until he becomes the perfect villain . He can finally get rid of this evil . He can finally bring justice to their suffering . This is what is needed . This is what is needed . The man who has left his home to fight for his life after getting shot on the forehead . At least he has escaped . He was right .    The sound of the blades being cut from the table clogs his head . His legs were not yet bound , they were bound to the table . The man didn ’ t move , he kept his mind open . That was until he noticed something . The blade hadn ’ t been cut . Not at all . It was fine . He felt it in his stomach .    A wave of nausea passes through him . It has come to this . This is what is needed . He was right . He had prepared his plan . He wasn ’ t ready to return home . He was not ready to get out of this world . He looked down at his hands . They were his . The chains of battle clatter loudly in the hall . He knows he is finally losing . It doesn ’ t matter how successful he is now , not until he become the perfect villain .
It started off as a joke . Like a joke that started off out with a prank call , with a name like J. M. and a date like J. M.   We 'll give that a shot of what happens when you hit the gym .   At first we thought it was an accident , like someone dropped an umbrella in the hallway , or something .   As we all got really into it , the bigger we got , the more it got funny .   Maybe it was a little of a joke , or a prank call on the phone , or some crazy teenager talking to a stranger .   We did n't know what was going on with it , but eventually we figured that we had a reason at all .   So we gave up on trying to catch it .   We left it there for a while , to see if it was even real .   The news channels could n't find it . They kept feeding it to us , asking us questions .   But we did n't know .   After a while , we got really tired of being around it like it was nothing .   So when it caught on , it started off as a joke .   We let it go till it stopped being funny .   Then it started being real .   We started to try and get it out of control .   But nothing has changed .   Until today .   I remember thinking back one day , two weeks ago .   All of a sudden , we heard a noise and looked up at the sky .   And , as if it were a dream , we saw a UFO hovering overhead .   This was a plane that landed on our planet .   Suddenly , I could n't believe my eyes .   We heard a voice yelling , `` Run ! Run ! ''   It was a plane that landed on our planet .   And then they dropped an umbrella in the hallway , and all of a sudden , a girl started screaming over the radio .   `` J. M. you are going to die . ''   I looked down to my hands .   `` Well , I 'm kidding . ''   I turned around to ask everyone if they had seen a UFO too . I stopped dead in my tracks .   Suddenly , my eyes shot open , and I was on the ground , bleeding out .   I looked around , and realized I was naked .   Wait a minute .   Wait .   `` Good . Well , let 's jump a hundred feet and go out of the window . ''   Wait .   Wait .   Wait .  
She was lying on her back in the office , her body broken . In front of her was the boss , standing there , smoking a cigar . It was just two hours since they had last held hands and sat like a family .   `` Can we sit some more ? ''   `` Um , sir , yes . '' The boss replied quickly . He could feel the anger rising in her .   He slowly walked towards the desk , and sat opposite her . His fist was covered in black smoke . He shook his head . `` What the hell is wrong , Mark ? ''   Mark raised his eyebrows . He did n't believe this . He could have heard screams . Surely he could have seen the blood on his hands , but he 'd never seen them do this to him .   `` You think me a hero ? '' He asked , his voice strong and commanding . `` Look at me . I think my boss should be dead and I think he should die . I 'm the only one who has survived , Mark , and I can do nothing but watch . ''   `` Why ? For God 's sake . I ca n't do anything ! '' Mark screamed . `` How can I watch the things I say ? How can I even live ? ! Do n't you hate me ? Are you even a hero ? ! ''   The boss had taken more strides forward towards the coffee table , then turned back to Mark . `` I 'm the only one who has ever fought someone , Mark ! I 've fought for no other reason than to protect them . I 've beaten crime , beaten the corrupt , beat the poor , beaten death , murdered politicians , killed all of them , but I have never lost ! ''   Mark took another step forward towards the coffee table . `` NO ! I will never go back . I 'm the only one who has ever died ! ! ''   He took a sharp turn towards the back room . `` You 're the only one who has died because of me , Mark ! You 're the only guy who has ever fought someone ! ''   `` You really think I hate you , Mark ? '' Mark shouted .   The boss shook his head again . `` Well , it might be because I do n't hate you , sir . ''   Mark smiled . `` You think they hate me ? ''   `` That their evil deeds only show that they do n't love me . ''   Mark looked down and saw the blood . `` You killed them all ? ! '' John asked .   `` Yes . '' Mark replied .   John let out a loud laugh . `` So you were at the office , when you accidentally murdered them all ? You killed everyone ? ''   `` Yes , sir . '' Mark agreed .   John looked around his living room . `` You murdered everyone ? ! ''   Mark stood up and looked at him . `` No . I did n't kill anyone . ''   John pulled out his gun and fired a round at the windows . `` Well , that 's good . Thanks for your service . ''   John walked back towards the building , taking a shot at the building . He pulled out his phone . Nothing worked , he just stared at the screen , and watched the message on the screen .   ***RAPE***
“ Is this… ? ” said Arthur as he eyed the familiar image . It was a rather bright and clear representation of Sir Arthur .   “ Sir , is this an image ? ” asked a rather unimpressed Arthur . “ It ’ s so… so familiar. ”   “ What do you mean it ’ s not ‘ mine ’ ? ” exclaimed Merlin . “ What do you mean they ’ re not mine ? ”   “ Well we ’ ve been thinking it for a while now , and we ’ re still able to translate , but I ’ m afraid we ’ re wrong about how it looks. ”   “ That ’ s because there are no stars in this universe right now. ”   “ No stars in this universe ? ”   Arthur thought for a moment . “ No stars in this universe , either ? ”   “ And we ’ re not in a universe where life exists , either. ”   “ And there have to be stars ? ”   Arthur was left speechless , and as he thought about it , suddenly , he was surrounded by darkness . As he stared upon the void , he sensed something move in front of him .   “ My dear friend ! My dear friend can you hear me ? Yes ! ”   Arthur heard a noise that must have been heard on the other side of the abyss , except this time , it was not the first one . It also must have been a different noise , accompanied by a louder , softer , resonating sound as if somebody was being played .   “ Yes ! ” said Arthur .   “ Can you hear me ? ” asked the voice .   “ Yes ! ”   “ Can you hear me , Arthur ? ”   “ Yes ! ”   “ Are you there ? ”   “ Yes , dear friend ! ”   “ You mean you ’ re not there . Come back. ”   Arthur slowly stood , and slowly , slowly walked towards the void , before disappearing as fast as he had come . After a few moments , he was in the darkness again , and he then heard the noises again , only this time , it was not the same noise . It was the same noise as before , this time , and this time , it was not the same noise as before .
It was a beautiful day . Not an unnatural day , not an unnatural day . I was taking class , studying hard at college , and the class was actually pretty much the same as yesterday . Most students were done with their lives already , and the rest of us were bored and went to bed . But not me . It was n't a particularly nice day , but no one was really paying attention to what I was studying .   About a hour later , I passed out , feeling like I was floating in nothing but dust . I woke up , the sun was shining above me , and the grass was growing back . I looked around , but nobody was around . I moved over to the side of the bed and grabbed the glasses off of my head and looked at them .   It was a page from one of the forums that was being updated . It said `` Page 1,200,000,000,000 , and counting , '' which was pretty much what I was looking for . I logged to Page 1,200,000 ; it was mostly just a simple text I needed to make my way out of the school .   I did n't know this was going to be normal , but I was starting to get worried , and I decided to check out the profile . I saw the most recent title , `` Top Secret Agent '' . I typed in my password and entered the password . I was about to open the top secret of the internet to get it fixed when I suddenly remembered something , which was n't in the profile . The most recent title was `` Agent '' .   `` Fucking hell '' , I thought .
Shit , she 's not supposed to see .   I stared at my reflection in disbelief .   The moment my hand touched my reflection , both my eyes widened , and an unnerving feeling reached around my shoulders .   I stood there , slack jawed , my hands clasping the side of my face , staring into the reflection .   Then , as if by magic , a flash of light came from above us .   Slowly , from the darkness , I saw one of my own .   I could see her eyes widen ! Her hands holding onto my face in a desperate dash for me .   After all , her face did n't look like mine , and it looked like I was the reflection of someone else .   All I could hear was the howl of my own heart .   Then , suddenly , all of a sudden , my future - my future - was gone .
I 've been following this prompt all week . Sometimes I get inspired , sometimes I get a little overwhelmed by my own worlds . Sometimes I work so hard , it seems like every story I 've written has the same exact same idea . Sometimes I wonder what 's happening to my imagination , what 's happening to me . Sometimes I wish I had any friends , but only a handful . Sometimes I wish I had the same dreams . Sometimes I think about how it felt when I told my mom I loved her .   [ CW ]   *I am a child . *   *I 'm not depressed . *   *I love my father . *   *I still love him . *   *I know my mom is right . I know my father is right . *   *I have such hope , why would I lose hope ? *   *I have such happiness . *   *I can still go to the store and buy a milk and cheese . *   *I can still be that smile on my face when I eat . I can still cry . *   *I have such happiness . *   *I 'm done . *
`` Now why should I fight for you , man ? ''   `` Because I do n't care . '' I stood firm and looked through the window , the grey blur had sunk in underneath , where it had come from . `` I do n't care how many people die because of me , or how many people die because I make them feel like they are dying . ''   `` Oh ? '' He winced slightly , trying to hold back a shudder . `` That 's just the way it is . ''   `` Can that be said for me ? ''   `` It can . '' A small smile crept onto his face , but it was quickly replaced with a scowl . `` No , not for me . ''   I stood dumbfounded for a moment , looking over at him . He was clearly not happy about this , as I had expected .   `` And so should you . ''   `` No , I do n't want you doing anything for me . ''   `` I 'm just doing what I can to help . I do n't care if you are alone . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I do n't know . '' With a slight pause , the old man raised his hand . `` Not anymore . ''   I stared at him slightly , wondering about whether or not he had seen this before . Clearly he was just too busy trying to find out what I was fighting for .   `` Why ? ''   `` Because you wo n't be happy about me anymore , man . ''   Then , as if in response , the old man raised a hand to my face and began to shake .   `` Are you sure that you understand ? ''   `` No ... I do n't . '' I was n't sure what to say . `` I do n't care . ''   `` You wo n't be happy anymore , man . '' The old man snapped his fingers and I began to move without much effort , feeling his hand shake again . `` You wo n't be happy anymore . ''   `` They are n't really happy anymore , man . ''   `` Are they not happy anymore ? '' A cold hand pressed down on my back . `` They 're dead . They 're gone . ''   `` You ca n't be happy anymore . '' Then , with a single flick of the wrist , I was gone .   The cold hand sat in the corner , staring out the window . 
`` Welcome to the Magic Shop ! This is your first time inside , and welcome to Magic Shop ! ''   As I was putting on my wand , a huge man in robes and a glowing , red hat walked towards me with a huge face .   `` So , um , I 'm guessing that you require a wand ? ''   `` A wand is a magical device . ''   `` But I 'm not a wand , are I ? ''   `` Yes , but it 's not an automatic item , it 's the most popular item market on Earth . ''   `` So , I 'm assuming you require a wand ? ''   `` Yes ! When I use this device I need a small device to carry my items . But it 's not very powerful , and it does n't work that way . ''   The big man grabbed a small device from the shelves and pressed a button on it . The screen lit up , and the man turned to my shop clerk .   `` Ah ! You 're going to get all the supplies ! ''   He motioned around , and the guy in the red hat returned to his small shop . I smiled inwardly , and thought , `` Are you sure ? ''   `` I had no choice . ''   `` Yeah , okay ! How much times do we have to tell you ? If you need anything , please use a new wand here . ''   `` Oh , absolutely . But there is no need to be rude , you have to get what you want . ''   `` I ca n't wait to see what will happen . Would n't it be cool to just take in each item , and just find some new ones ? ''   `` Um , sure , if you could call it ... .my wand ? ''   `` No , it 's not an automatic thing . ''   `` Well , that 's a nice idea . Then , I 'll just get the supplies and then I 'll be right back in my shop . ''   His grin was infectious , and I thought , `` Do n't worry about that ! Just do n't worry about it . Do n't worry about what you might find next ! ''   `` Sure ! '' He smiled at me , and walked away .   -- -   Thanks for reading ! If you liked this story , check out /r/BlankPagesEmptyMugs

`` Where is it ? ! '' Shouted Jack . He had never seen a car that would have destroyed a place like this . Nothing like it was even remotely close to the edge of his city . He was n't sure how much time he had .   He could n't help but notice a dark figure walking slowly down the sidewalk . He was n't sure who it was . He slowly reached out his hand for a cigarette , and lit before he heard the screech of tires .   `` You 're going to have to do this again . '' Jack said to himself . He leaned against the wall in front of the car . `` Please ... '' He finally began to say , but it was n't enough .   Jack let out a deep *chang* , and slowly brought his hand down .   `` I 'm sorry , but I ca n't do this again . '' He slowly said to himself .   He reached out his hand , and caught the black man 's wrist . He turned his wrist , and let out a scream that echoed throughout his city as he was tossed out of the car .   The man fell quickly , and Jack quickly laid on the ground . He tried to move , but his muscles gave in . His hands began to tremble uncontrollably . He felt a stabbing pain radiating from his chest . He felt light , and then darkness . Jack looked up at the ceiling , and saw a shadowy figure , sitting next to him . He turned to look at Jack , and gasped .   `` FUCK . '' He screamed , feeling the emptiness tear at his bones in the darkest hours of his life .
`` I 'm sorry , they 'll catch you . ''   A crowd . They were cheering for me . The crowd was full of people , all wanting me to help them . What is my choice ? What is my purpose ?

'Yeah kid I know , I just do n't understand why you should have stayed so open with me . ' She was saying .   I had n't been the type to talk about my family before . The fact that they were not one of the family I had , was almost as surprising . I was a kind kid , when I first met them . A good kid , I guessed .   My parents were nice people in a manner that could n't be attributed to my unusual behavior . They were gentle , kind people , but also kind . They had the decency and compassion that they deserved . I remember being able to hold my mother 's hand when she was not afraid . I did n't even know it meant anything anymore .   I was the one I had the power to make them happy , and I was the one that helped them achieve that . I was an outcast , like everyone else . I could n't really help but smile and smile when my parents talked . If they were unhappy , why would they care ?   I was the one that kept them from hitting me or asking how my power worked .   *For example , when our family decided to leave , the family bought us a toy house for our children . There was no way we were going to get to play there until we got older . *   God , that toy house was still beautiful !   *It was also slightly odd to turn it on and off . The whole house was made to look like the same one the one the family wore from before , so no more rust and no more rust . We got nothing on us anymore , except for the bed . *   *I do n't know how , but that was not the reason I was the least bit upset . I was confused as to why I was upset . *   I was the perfect dad ; no longer afraid of me .   Well now here I am . I was cursed with the gift of the curse of the curse of the curse of *Pitch . *   I was cursed with an evil nature .   My family had never been this cruel or selfish , either . They did everything they could to make me happy , but that was not possible . They could n't bring me closer to happiness , as my magic was stronger but stronger . They could n't give me money , as my magic was more powerful and stronger .   My magic was no longer the ability to be kind to anyone else , or anyone if that was what it was .   They had found a spell that would make me happy , and I had no choice but to become my way of life . I had to become the way they wanted me to be . The way my parents wanted me to be . The way their family wanted me to be .   *I do n't know why I should have stayed so open with you . *   I just did what I was told , and I waited .   They never stopped at my house , and they always kept the windows open . They never opened the door , or let me in , because they knew I was there . I always gave their wishes , but I never told them goodbye .   I was born with the power to make anyone happy .   In spite of the curse , I did n't want to become unhappy . I wanted to make them happy .   The doctors thought it was a miracle , because it worked . The doctors did n't want me to die . They said it would only kill me so , but it will kill the rest .   I tried to be kind , even though it worked . I tried to be honest . I tried to be strong . I tried to be kind .   I tried to be different , even though it worked . I hope I will die someday . I hope I will still be happy .   I hope I will still be alive .   I hope he will see me .   **If you liked this story , you can find more of my work at /r/Inkfinger/ . **
They say that if you find a way to kill your loved ones , you never get over it . They say that it was something that made you do it . The way that your family should feel at the sight of the person you loved . The way that their kids would feel at the look of their loved ones . And then it all ends .   I am trying to figure out what I am doing now . I ’ m not sure how my life would turn out in person , but this is how I repay Him . I forgive myself when he gives me the chance , when I tell him that I was a selfish bastard . But then I realize what I ’ m doing . I am going to have to do it .   Wait . Can I ask him what he did ? Should I do it ?   I will get to him . I will be able to tell him that everything is okay . I will tell him that I am sorry . I will be able to tell him that everything is okay .   And he will know that . 
**A History of Zulu**   *My people-*   **The World Government**   *I 'm sorry . *   **The World Government**   *I have tried to help you all . I have tried everything . Everything . I 've even tried to protect you ! To bring you down ! I 've even tried to help you all ! I 'm all your friends . *   `` *I 'm sorry . * ''   `` *Catch me , little one . I 'm not going to hurt you . I 'm not going to hurt you . But I 'm not going to kill you . I 'm not going to hurt you . * ''   As the words left his mouth , the girl shrieked , her eyes falling on the man behind him .   ** '' Oh , do n't fuck with me ! '' **   The man , a young man , reached into his trench coat , but he pulled out a small white revolver .   `` I 'll show you what to do , little one ! ''   And with that , he disappeared into blackness , and that , the girl shrieked , her eyes falling on the man behind her .   ** '' Little one , why are you doing this ? `` **   `` Because you 're not going to hurt me , '' the man replied to her , as he walked away .   `` We 're done here , '' she replied .   As the man kept walking , he watched , as his people disappeared away , and the man continued to walk away .   * '' No more '' * he said quietly to himself .   * '' Perhaps '' * he thought .   ** '' Goodbye , little one . `` **
I loved love my mom . She was the most caring woman I knew . I had only ever met her when her dad died . My mom would make me cry whenever I was n't there . She would say I was ok . I did my best to make sure I did n't fall in love with her . There were times when she would tell me she could not handle my lack of love for her . I could only make out her soft hazel eyes and soft soft cheeks . She was everything that I wanted . After all , she could n't hurt me while I was inside . She was my best soldier and everything that I wanted . My best friend and my best friend .   A few months after she died , I saw her again . This time , she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen . Her lips were soft and soft . Her eyes were blue and soft . She was everything that I wanted . I made her feel so happy . She knew that she could never love me . That she was everything I wanted .
I hate that I can leave this world . It 's a sickening thing to be sad . Life just is n't the same then . I hate the fact that I 've watched my friends die . I want to laugh , cry , cry , and mourn . I need to be something . I have to be something . I have to be something . I have to be something . I have to be something . I have to be something . I ca n't do that , but I always do . I love you , but I ca n't understand why you ca n't be something . I love you so . I love you so . I 'm so sorry ! This is what I deserve ! It 's not my fault ! I just do n't understand what 's going to happen . Why are you doing this to me ? I 'm so sorry ! I love you ! I 'm so sorry ! I missed you ! ! My love ! !
`` Do n't worry , you 'll be back soon enough . It 's completely safe for you and your daughter . ''   `` But my wife is in a car accident , and does n't have enough resources to support us . ''   `` Now take a minute , we 're not getting anywhere , it does n't look like we 're having any fun . ''   `` I can only do this once , but I can promise you it wo n't make you cry and I promise . ''   `` I promise you , it will . I promise you , it will . ''   `` Thank you , honey , I hope you keep your promise , '' the woman said as she started to leave the room .   `` If I 'd just let you go , I 'd be happy , '' I said as I grabbed him .   `` I have a wife , I have an son , and a daughter ! How am I supposed to do it ? ''   `` I 'm not sure , honey . I 'm sure you 'll catch your breath . It 's okay . ''   `` I can do this , I promise . ''   I closed my eyes as I opened them the last few times more .
`` So what are you doing here ? ''   `` Well , I was just , uh , testing a new- ''   `` What lab ? You do n't understand ? ''   `` Look , I 'm just doing some research and I just got this thing working with the other guys so no- ''   `` OK , okay , fine , OK. Bye . ''   `` What doya mean ? What lab ? ''   `` Nothing really , just some junk and some tools , mostly some stuff . ''   `` Oh . ''   `` Wait , what ? ''   `` Nothing . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Nothing . ''   `` Good , that 's nice . ''   `` Well ? ''   `` Nothing , really . ''   `` That 's not bad . ''   `` What ? That 's not even good . ''   `` *Fine* , fine . Just go over here . ''   `` What are we- ''   `` Nothing . ''   `` No , no , no , no , no no , no . ''   `` Are you a scientist ? ''   `` *No* , you just kept saying that . ''   `` Ok , okay , go over here . ''   `` So what are we- ''   `` Nothing , really . ''   `` Do you want to see science ? It 's so interesting . ''   `` I think so . ''   `` Are you , um , an engineering major ? ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` You 're a science major ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Okay , alright . ''   `` So what makes you think you 're an engineering major ? ''   `` I 'm what ! ''   `` *What ? * ''   `` I do n't really understand . ''   `` What do you mean , you 're an engineering major ? ''   `` Well , I 've always had this sort of connection between myself and the other guys . ''   `` Shit . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` Ok . ''   `` So what if we were n't scientists ? ''   `` What if ... ''   `` What if we did n't know that we were intelligent ? ''   `` What if we did n't know anything about something else ? ''   `` Whatever ? ''   `` Hey , aha ! ''   `` Wait , what if we were n't intelligent ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` What- ? ''   `` You ... you were only- ''   `` No , it ca n't be . ''   `` Well , well , *you* ca n't be . ''   `` *Fine* , fine . I 've had this sort of connection between myself and the other guys . ''   `` That 's not even something ! ''   `` Just , you really do n't understand . ''   `` Well , you did , and I guess it all goes away . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` Ok . ''   `` Hey ! ''   `` You better not worry about what I saw . I wo n't ever hurt you again , no matter what . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` Oh , please . Let 's go see it . ''   -- -- -   `` Hey , hey ! ''   `` Hey ! ''   `` Hey ! ''   `` Hey !

Halt !   The silence is deafening . The dust is settling now . All of it . And yet , there is no sound . Of course there is nothing . There isn ’ t . I have to run faster . I have to find a shelter .   I ’ ve had enough .   I keep going in circles around the corner of the building . There are bodies everywhere . Most of them are dead . Others like this . They have all been either injured or dead for years . Some of them are dying because of a stray bullet found in the bushes of a nearby park after leaving their car . It was a miracle . I didn ’ t get really close to them .   Still , I try to get some sleep . The city is all quiet now , but I ’ m able to hear everything ticking away . My eyes focus on the building . It ’ s filled with bodies . No one is going to make it . It ’ s made out of all of them . It looks like there ’ s a building in the sky . A church . It looks like some sort of church . It looks like a church with a big golden cross hanging from a sign on its front . Its wood is smooth and white . It looks like someone had built it .   The dust has settled and everything is quiet .   I ’ ve been running for years . I ’ ve been really strong . I could be anyone . I could be a hero or a martyr . I just shouldn ’ t have wanted to go in circles around the corner .   I ’ m getting close to the building when I hear footsteps approaching from behind me . It ’ s my neighbor . I quickly look to his side . He is standing there with a gun pointed at my head . He doesn ’ t look at me .   “ What are you doing , dad ? ”   “ You just had to die , ” I say slowly . “ I don ’ t know what you are talking about . I think you ’ ve died before . You ’ ve been in a lot of bad situations. ”   “ Stop it ! ”   My neighbor pulls his gun and begins to pull the trigger .   I stop running and look at my neighbor . It ’ s the only thing in the street staring straight into my eyes . I can ’ t tell him what to do . I grab my gun and throw it at him . But he doesn ’ t move . He doesn ’ t even mutter a word . He just looks up to me and slowly turns around . Just like the dead people do when they ’ re hit .   I go into a daze and look back at the building . My neighbor and I both look down at our hands . I try to tell him to sit down but I can ’ t . I stand up and look at my neighbor . He is staring at me . He looks so sad . I know this is the beginning of the end . He doesn ’ t even move or laugh . All of that is gone .   I put my hands on my knees and try to hold back tears . My neighbor looks at me with those same sad eyes and whispers , “ I know. ”   My neighbor looks at his hands again . Again , his face is calm . He looks so tired . His head is still turning though . His eyes are staring straight into mine . He is crying . He is so afraid . He does n't think . He just looks at me . The anger comes over me . I begin to cry .   I start to sit up and look at my neighbor . He starts to turn around but it ’ s too late . He shoots me in the chest . I just sit there in agony . I feel nothing . I still can don ’ t move .   I ’ m still standing in pain . The only thing in the street is my neighbor ’ s gun and his gun .   As I look down at my hands and blood covered hands , I look at myself in death .   The sun looks bright down and I can see the stars . I see the sun . I have no idea how long it ’ s been since I saw it . I wonder if all those years of pain have been gone and all those years had been on the horizon . No one did anything .   And yet , there is silence . 
*Tap tap tap tap tap*      I stand there , staring at the white screen . Red , red .      I can hear the sound of the tapping . I think it 's getting louder now , too . I walk over to the kitchen , grab as much coffee as I can . I sit on the stool , and close my eyes . I begin to doze off .       The tapping stops . The white walls of the house close , and I hear the tapping again . I open my eyes to the screen , and see the white wall again .       I open them to see the white wall . It 's getting louder now , and I stop . I sit on the stool , and close my eyes . I open them to see the white wall again .      I open my eyes to the screen of my house . The white wall has closed . I stand here , staring at the white wall . I close my eyes to the white wall again . I open them to see the white wall again . I stand here , staring at the white wall again . I reach into my pocket to pick up my guitar . I grab a note from my wallet , and put it to my ear . I flip through my notes .       I look up from the guitar , and listen to the tapping . It 's getting louder now , and I sit on the chair , and close my eyes .
I was already late for class . I had just finished my lesson and just began reading .   A teacher was standing next to me . She was staring at the class . What could I do ?   `` Hey ! '' I said .   `` Hey ! '' she said again .   `` What are you doing here ? '' another teacher asked .   `` Here , '' I said , pointing my finger at the teacher .   `` What would the teacher care about that ? '' another teacher asked . `` She 's a teacher , she 's going to make sure you do n't do anything crazy . ''   `` I 'm going to go to a lab , '' I said . `` I know . I 'm just telling the truth . ''   Another teacher said something I did n't really care about . `` No , you ca n't go to a lab . ''   `` Uhh , I wo n't . I want to explore it . It 's so dangerous , you should n't be here . ''   `` Why are you here ? '' another teacher asked .   `` I 'm here for you , '' I said .   `` What do you want ? '' A student asked .   `` I 'm going to leave , '' I said .   Another teacher said something I did n't even really care about . `` Why do you need to leave ? ''   `` We ca n't just leave you in this classroom . We 've got to let you go . ''   `` What if we let you go , '' another teacher said . `` You ca n't leave right now . I need to sleep . ''   `` I 'm sorry , '' I yelled .   `` No , do n't . I 'm sorry . But I ca n't go to a lab , I have work to do . ''   `` Okay , come on , sit down . '' Another teacher said .   `` I wo n't , '' I said . My hand was shaking . `` I want to sleep . ''   `` You ca n't leave me here , '' another teacher said . `` I really do n't want to leave . ''   `` Okay , okay . '' Another teacher said . `` I 'm going to leave you in the exam room . ''   `` Okay , '' I said . Suddenly , I was n't alone anymore .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   *sorry , this is my second time writing without criticism , and I appreciate any feedback . *
`` You 're eating it . ''   The words had sent a shiver down my spine . My mouth hung open like a man who knew he could n't get rid of me . I was afraid , but also glad to have a friend .   `` You have n't eaten me for a year . ''   I opened my eyes and saw a dark figure approaching me . The man looked me up and down , looking at my face . He was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and jeans . He turned around and walked towards me .   `` What are you doing ? '' I asked . `` Are you *trying* to ... kill me ? Did you even ... did anything ? You 're hungry , and you 're not going to stop me . ''   He did n't like the idea of killing me .   `` Why do you keep torturing me ? I ca n't do this , and I ca n't eat you ! You 're just a pile of meat , why ? Why do you keep torturing me ? ''   I stood up and tried to take a look through the hooded sweatshirt and jeans . `` Why do n't you stop it ? This is all I have . ''   `` You kill me everyday , what am I going to do ? To eat you ? ''   `` I have no idea . I have n't eaten in a year . ''   The figure looked at me confused . `` What is going on ? You used to be a good friend , but you were no good friend anymore . ''   `` I 'm just feeding you . I 'm sick of torturing you ! ''   `` Yes , you are . ''   He walked towards me , pointing towards a plate that was sitting on the table . `` Are you going to kill me ? ''   I shook my head . `` I think I am . ''
It was supposed to be an easy fight , but he had n't been able to hide his disgust . Here he stood , ready to give up everything and save the world from *him* , again . He stood up from the stone floor , looking up the stairs , he could n't help but think about his family now . His loved ones , his family at home right now .   `` No , '' he sighed . `` No . No . No no no . '' He stepped out into the cool night breeze , staring at the familiar landscape in front of him . `` ... .. '' He pushed his feet up on the grass and looked up at the sky . A great , red , and green swirl of clouds was setting in . `` No ... no no ... . '' He took deep breaths , and sat back down , his head resting on his knees .   He never expected this . He never expected that this would happen ; he always had wanted this to happen , but what he actually * expected ... was this ... .   `` I 'm sorry , '' he said softly . `` I know you 're angry at me , but please do n't blame me . I 'm telling you everything , I 'm right here , just like my parents . '' He looked around his town , the world was in chaos , everyone was fighting in different areas . He was wrong . He was wrong . He was wrong . It was all up to him to move on , and to protect his family again .   The second he stepped foot upon the grass , he saw the bright red swirl of clouds , and the blue swirl of clouds . He heard a loud chattering noise from behind him . `` Get down ! '' He turned around , the figure was standing there , his face impassive . `` Get down ! '' He started climbing up the high hill , his cape billowing in the wind . He knew exactly what he had to do , but he was also going to take it away from him .   He heard a loud crash in the distance , but he could n't tell where . This was too easy . He took a step forward , still in shock . The figure still standing there , was staring at him , not daring to move . The last thing he heard before he disappeared into the dark was a voice , `` I am Jodyne . '' he spoke softly .
“ This isn ’ t a dream , ” said the scout , tossing the weapon in the nearby corner . He wasn ’ t exactly sure what to make of it , but a second time it wasn ’ t like he was going to be able to even take it back . Behind him , a small blue dragon lurched , the black wings fluttering as it raised its head . The scout watched in helpless horror as it turned around , the sun warming its white scales .   The last thing the scout remembered was he being pulled from the shadows , stumbling into a trap . Then he was outside , the world cold and desolate .   “ There ’ s no coming back , ” he said , pointing at the white , furry creature . “ No time to shine ? ”   The white beast regarded him expectantly . For a moment , it just shrugged and seemed to consider this .   “ I think it ’ s fine , ” said the scout . “ But a few months ago , I told you this . You need to listen. ”   The white shark scowled . The scout stared at it , feeling it uncomfortable , and then he pulled a small , dark red ribbon . The silver ribbon rolled along the floor , into a strange pattern . The scout began tugging , before eventually pulling .   “ I won ’ t let that happen , ” said the white shark . “ But I ’ ll let you back in the day. ”   The scout stared at it for a long time , then suddenly he was back on the ground . The white shark looked back up at him , and immediately regretted saying anything as he felt he could speak again .   “ Is that a sign ? ” asked the scout .   “ A sign , yes , ” responded the white shark . “ But it ’ s not there . Do you know what *that* means ? ”   The scout looked down at his feet . There was a line around his feet , which made him feel small . It looked like there was only a few meters of solid ground ahead . It was small for an entire field , but his eyes didn ’ t quite follow it .   “ Your mission ends , ” said the scout , then turned around to face the beast .   The white shark looked back up at him expectantly and took one last look at him .   “ I am sorry. ” he said . “ But I must return to my home , and return on the day of my return. ”   The scout blinked , then stared at the white shark . Then walked outside , and his eyes followed the path he had set .
`` Mommy ? ''   `` Yeah ? ''   `` Are you gon na stop ? ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because you 're going to eat food okay ? ''   `` Of course I want to . ''   `` Thank you . ''   The couple sat on the bench next to each other . If both were on the bench , the first person to turn toward the girls would get the bite of the ice cream , the second to watch the first person get chewed up .   The girls each got chewing first , while the second person chewed down . This always made the man on the bench twitch . He was always the loudest , the fastest , the quickest and the most agile . As the girl , she always followed him through school , walking along his way , and a little bit behind him .   The one girl that would make a game out of something was the youngest . She was a bit older than the second , but she liked her game better than the first . If they could pick a game , she could play it out of everyone 's free time , but she also liked the game better than the first other . She was quiet , but she carried herself with her head down and her feet on the ground as she walked . The one girl was always so quick , so big and big . She had a shadow in her hair and a smile on her expression that made herself seem bigger then her peers . She walked until she noticed everyone else was out of the corner of her eye .   The girl was still chewing on ice cream . Her feet moved as she walked outside of her house , but she walked toward her house next door . She walked through the door , right up to her room . At least she was in the middle of the living room . The girl was still eating ice cream , and she walked toward her room . She opened the door , and she saw the man behind her . She turned around and saw him standing before her . She got up and walked toward him , looking as though she could see the future , but only saw the future and just saw him .   The one girl walked towards him . She moved toward him , but he stopped her . She did n't see his face .   She moved towards him , and she was in a situation where she could n't even see him . When she felt that she had got the chance , she ran .   She ran when there was a second boy . She ran through the house , but he was nowhere to be seen . She ran after the boy , searching for him . She ran for the other man in the house , but he was nowhere to be seen . She ran until the boy was nowhere to be seen . She kept running until she came to a stop in front of the school , and ran until she was at a dead sprint .   The girl sprinted for the man , and he was gone . But the girl ran into her room , and was there shortly after going to her room to grab the first girl . She grabbed the first girl by the collarbone , and tugged her . She gasped , and she looked up , as though she blinked .   The girl looked at the body . She was bleeding . The girl looked at the body . No longer had she been able to see her friends .   The girl looked up through the hole she managed to get from the accident . She looked to the boy below her . She looked at the body , and she remembered the boy , and remembered how he made his friends and how he came to her . She looked to the body , and she remembered how she took advantage of the situation , and how she smiled when she thought she was safe .   But the girl stopped . She looked to the body , and she saw it looked a little different from where she remembered it earlier . She looked for a bit longer now , and walked toward it , and it looked a little longer now .   She walked toward the corpse , and looked at the body . She walked toward the corpse , and , she saw her friend , standing before her from the body 's side . She walked toward the corpse , and walked toward the corpse . She walked toward the corpse , and walked toward the corpse . She walked toward the corpse , and walked toward the corpse . She walked toward it , and walked toward the corpse , and walked toward the body , and walked toward the body . She walked toward the corpse , and walked toward the corpse . Her hands were in her pockets , and she grabbed a knife , and ran for it .   The girl ran out of the school , and headed for the stairs , and she ran to the second stairs . She ran
`` So ... I need a few extra pants ... ''   I looked up from my bag . It was a black leather one , but it had a red stripe at the bottom . It had a very white leather cover covering it , just a few meters away from where I remembered sitting . The back of my head was a little sore .   `` No , no , '' I muttered . `` Do n't . Just . Let . Me . Be . A . God . ''   I looked around my apartment . The carpet was painted a red , and it looked like some kind of wood chandelier had been thrown at me . `` Oh no . NO ! '' I yelled , exasperated that I had woken up in the middle of a dark room , and that something had broken loose .   `` Oh no . Please ! ''   I grabbed my bag , and walked towards him . `` No ... please . I need this to end forever ! Please ! Please do n't ! ''   He looked at me , and said , `` No . Do n't be afraid . There is nothing I can do to prevent it . ''   I looked away , and ran after him .   -- -   `` Look , '' he said . `` I know we do n't have your help . But do n't worry about me . You 'll be free from this . You 'll not need to worry about me . You 'll be able to leave now . Just be careful , okay ? ''   I nodded .   He looked at me in a state of shock . `` Listen , I 'm sorry , but I need you to leave . I need to leave now . Just be careful . ''   I looked at him . He looked at me in a state of disbelief . `` I 'm sorry , I ca n't do that . Help me ? ''   The man opened his mouth for a reply , but he was only a few centimeters away from me . He began to speak .   `` Stay right here . Please . Please stop . Please . ''   I closed my eyes . I did n't want to do this . I could n't say anything . I could n't think anymore . I closed my eyes and waited until he faded away .   -- -   `` Listen , '' he said . `` I 'm sorry , but I ca n't just leave . I ca n't leave into the blackness . I ca n't let you live . I ca n't let you die . I ca n't let you live . I ca n't let you die . I hope , if you stay , you can continue to exist . I love you , and I know it 'll be soon . ''   His mouth dropped open .   -- -   `` I love you . I love you . ''   *And with that , she was gone . *
*I guess I am going to have to start with the first thing . I can ’ t tell you how hard it is to describe things without imagining them for the first time . *   “ You hear me ? ” Said the young face of the worker in the thick-rimmed glasses .   “ Just keep calm and keep your eyes on the ground . I know this is getting ridiculous but I am ready to do the impossible ”   “ I am ? You don ’ t know , I am just waiting to be the last one , the only one in here ” The young man replied .   “ You can ’ t just lie to me that ’ s not true ”   “ Yup but why would you think that ? All you ever wanted was what you had . Everything you had dreamed of , everything that you want . Everything you could ever possibly dream of. ”   “ You never thought you were going to be the only one ”   “ You made the choice to join the wrong group ”   “ Yeah I guess it ’ s true . But you could never have imagined that , and you could never have imagined that you would never be the one to join the other group ”   “ Like the next time you get to join ? ”   “ Or the next time you ’ re not going to be the one to join the others and you ’ ll never be your friends ”   The worker sighed , and turned towards the exit .   “ Thank you for showing me what is important , you ’ re welcome to join us ” 
We both ran into each other with heads in our hands and knees on the floor of our apartment building . Our clothes , now stained and shredded , were both torn clean of skin and blood . Our jeans were now stained with chunks of rock and sweat . I was panting heavily and the weight of both of us keeping my hand off the floorboard kept me from moving the ground .   `` Awwwwwwwww '' I shouted out as the other body was laying on the ground next to me , now covered in blood and bits of glass . `` Please ! '' I begged as I tried to get air in the pit of my stomach .   `` Stop ! Please ! Stop ! '' I shouted back . I did n't want to hear it . I was hoping for some form of escape . Would it be better to just find a way to get out of here and go find some kind of way out .   Before I could even respond , the other body was lying on the bed next to me , bloodied and beaten up . I screamed out in frustration as I tried to get my hands off the floorboard . My body was shaking uncontrollably as if I was trying to run . I struggled to pull myself upright , barely able to hold back my tears . I was too scared to do anything , as I was standing and trying to push myself to my feet . I held onto the wall to steady myself , as if trying to push myself to get up . I was no different from the previous one . An explosion rocked the apartment building and brought me down where I was standing .   `` This bitch ! This one ! It 's not my fault ! I was never even supposed to be here ! ! '' I yelled out as I pushed myself to my feet . `` What the fuck this shit is ... its not- ''   Suddenly , a shot of light burst into the air between my eyes . I closed my eyes and focused on the light as I opened them .   `` I 'm dead ! ''   ... .   I woke up in my bed in an unfamiliar room with a strange contraption sitting in front of me . The contraption was made of strange wires and some kind of thick glass wrapping around me . I watched my bed die , as I heard a woman yell , `` Do n't move ! Please , do n't ! ''   I opened my eyes , expecting a white room , or something . Instead , I found , and felt , myself lying in a metal chair to my right on the ground . My chest was so sore from my long fall that my legs felt like they were going to die . I felt my eyes begin to water and I looked over at my bed and realized that I was lying on cold , hard cement . I was also on a metal table to my left . I looked around for something , anything to jump off of .   `` Oh no ! No , please ! '' I yelled into the metal . `` I- wait , what the hell ? '' I asked .   A woman yelled out through her mouth what sounded like a gun . I looked out over to my bed where I just killed myself and looked to find that I was naked . I looked to my left and saw my face staring back at me . The woman on the other end of the table pulled out a gun from her pocket and pointed it at me .   `` SHUT UP ! '' She yelled .   I was a little confused , as could be . As I looked down at my body , I realized that I was wearing a white button down shirt . It had a bow with holes in it , with a name tag on it . I looked at my body . My hair had grown a little more white , and I was now wearing a black trench coat with a heavy black button up shirt .   `` What the hell ! ? '' I yelled into the metal . `` What the heck are you doing here ? ! ''   She pulled the trigger . The bullet flew into the ceiling , blowing it back off the table with a deafening resounding bang . I screamed out as I heard another bullet rip through the air .   `` STOP ! '' I screamed out , pulling the trigger . The bullet ripped through the ceiling and pierced the metal , killing everything in its path . The gun landed on the floor next to me and I stood up , panting heavily .   `` Shit ! '' I shouted out again as I felt myself get up off the ground and get into a sitting position . I sat up quickly and looked around for something to jump off of .   `` PUT YOUR FUCKING GUN DOWN ! '' I yelled out as I grabbed the gun from the table . It was still at my fingertips
Beads of sweat accumulated on Ben 's forehead , and he realized that he was sweating profusely as he stared at the familiar red ceiling .   `` Alright , let 's get this straight . My name is Nick . I 've been robbed from my job as a SWAT team that 's stationed outside of the bank . I do n't need to tell you my name , I 've never robbed a bank before . But this does n't mean that I have nothing to tell you , '' stated the masked man beside him .   `` I know , there 's just one thing . I 've heard the rumors about this stuff . I have to understand . It 's never been explained to anyone else before . And then again , there 's no way I 'd even be here in this situation . And by the way , I saw you going over the other files at the bank , and I noticed that you 're a bit of a wimp . ''   Ben looked around quickly . They had been standing at an old oak door on the far side of the bank . That had definitely been a sign that they were a bank robber .   Ben did n't think much of it , until the masked guy replied `` I told you that I 'm in need of your help . '' Ben nodded noncommittally and continued to work . As the night progressed , the masked man began to talk . He started explaining everything he knew . He explained that he was a regular police officer and was just here out of town . Ben 's heart began to race , and he struggled to keep a straight face .   `` So I 'm just going to go get our asses out of here and start robbing banks ... '' stuttered the masked man , trying to muster up his words .   Ben just stared at him . A blank look in his eye .   Suddenly , a loud bang erupted from the ceiling . Ben was screaming wildly , and as he collapsed to the floor , he heard a loud *thud* as something hit him square in the head .   **BANG . **   Ben heard loud thuds as he felt his head and body hit the floor . Then , blood started dripping from his head .   `` You do n't even have to worry about getting into this situation , '' said the masked man as he slowly began running .   Ben ran and ran back into the bank . He ran past a few others , then into another room . Ben found himself on the far side of a big oak door with a small window .   `` What the fuck ! ! '' he yelled as he felt his head throbbing as he watched the last of his friends get shot like fools by a single bullet from the gunman .   Ben smiled as he walked out into the street . There was a knock on the door .   `` Hey buddy , you 're okay in there . I 'm down here with my girlfriend . That 's been a while since I 've seen you . ''   The large wooden door swung open . Ben looked around , and saw that he was standing in front of a large table . The table had a picture of a girl sitting on it . The picture was of a man , face down with a gun pointed at his head . There was a large note on the table .   **DO NOT ENTERTAINMENT OF A MANKIND . **   Ben looked around the room and saw the face of the girl close to him .   `` No , no . '' He said . `` Please do n't leave me . I 'm sure I 'm not going to make it if you do n't . There 's no one other than you . I 'm sorry for what I 've done . ''   He looked back at the table .
Ever since I opened my notebook , I 'd been browsing , sometimes even skimming old websites , when for the first time ever I read one of these stupid Google docs . I had n't noticed the app until now . It was n't like I had the right to , at least , not until I read about it . The entire google search page was mostly blank , with no single other destination available . Nothing except for a few pages in a random order . Slowly , I started to type in the text-level , until my thumb caught a bookmark that read , `` Click `` . I clicked on it , not knowing what to do next . I did n't notice anything out of the ordinary when I started the whole search page .   It was a dark , cramped room , surrounded by an empty space . The walls were covered in dirty graffiti , and there were graffiti everywhere . I stared at it for a few minutes before deciding to head back to my computer . The last thing I saw was a black , slicked back , laptop hanging from its hook . I walked over to the source of my confusion , and reached for it .   After a few minutes , the cursor turned green a few times , and I opened the notebook , unsure why I bothered to click it . The text-level was blank again , save for a few paragraphs in the same order , and nothing else to read . I grabbed my phone , still wondering why the app did n't make any progress . I dialed 911 , but did not answer .   They sat me down on a hospital bed , asking me what was wrong with me . I told them that I 'd seen a man go missing , and that I had died . They thought I would not believe this , but it was the first time I 'd ever seen another man go missing .   I refused to answer . I went to sleep , hoping that I had n't gone crazy .   Until I woke up . I had seen someone just down the halls . They were wearing a hoodie , and had a gun pointed at me . I looked at them , and they said , `` Stay and do not harm anyone . ''   I hung up .   I awoke to a gunshot . I said , `` What the fuck ? ''   `` You killed yourself , do n't you ? You died trying to help yourself . ''   I stared at them for a few more moments , before deciding to continue . I went in to work , and got ready for work . No one came to the office , so I headed to my cubicle . Unfortunately , I lived alone , so I could n't get it done . I went to my cubicle , and started typing in the text-level again .   Nothing .   *Bang , bang , bang*   I stopped , confused . *Well shit . * I thought to myself . *Is this some kind of prank I 'm playing on myself ? *   I made my way home , put my phone away , and began sleeping .   Just as the ambulance took me to the hospital , I saw a man enter the room . It was a man , with a gun pointed at my head . They asked me what happened to myself , and I told them that I was shot . In order to keep myself sane , I got a cell phone with the location of the man .   After a few minutes , the man told me that I was shot . I asked him where everyone was . He said , `` They asked me what happened to the man , and I said that I was shot . I thought of all of the people that were in my life , and then they said , `` They asked me what happened to the man , and I replied that I was shot . I thought of all of the people that used to live here , and then they asked me why I was shot . ''   I tried to reply , but my mind still did n't come up . *Ok , so that 's true . * I thought .   I woke up in a dark , cramped room , surrounded by dirty graffiti , and there were graffiti everywhere . I looked at it for a few minutes before deciding to head back to my computer . The last thing I saw was a black , slicked back , laptop hanging from its hook . I walked over to the source of my confusion , and pressed the icon to download the app . I went in to my computer , and opened the notebook , unsure why the app did n't make any progress . The text-level was blank again , save for a few paragraphs in the same order , and nothing else to read . I waited for the ambulance to arrive , and after a couple minutes , the silhouette
Trevor lay in bed , splayed out on the cold wood floor . He felt a hot breath on his face .   `` I just want to thank you for the rest of your life . I 'm actually really here for you . ''   Trevor looked at his wife , sitting in the same rocking chair as his newborn . Her hair was thin but blonde , and her eyes were full of life . They were bright green , and her cheeks even flashed . Her eyes sparkled with life .   `` Do n't worry , Trevor . I 've been waiting for you . '' Trevor smiled at her . He put his hand through the long hair she was now holding .   `` I love you , too . ''   Trevor put his hand back on his daughter 's shoulder . He was about to say goodbye but his daughter interrupted .   `` Oh ... hi , there 's Trevor . ''   Trevor opened his eyes and saw his wife seated over him . She was wearing a wrinkled pink dress with a small blue skirt and a red sequined tie . He knew she was the daughter .   `` Oh Trevor , come on ! What have I told you ? ''   Trevor stared at her for a moment before turning to her and smiling at the woman .   `` You know Tim , it 's funny . It 's not funny at all . The last time I saw you , I really felt sad . How could you not see me ? ''   She giggled and tilted her head back .   `` You were still the same as me , '' Trevor said in a hushed tone . `` I 'd been in love with you for a year now . When you went back to a time when there was no one to share my joy with ? You were just an outcast . A fluke . ''   He watched her mouth open and closed before saying , `` I hate you , too . I hate everything about you . I hate the way you look at me . I hate the way I laugh every time you try to kill me . I hate all my life . I hate the feeling of happiness . I hate everyone . I hate everyone and everything . You were always there for me because you deserved it . You deserved everything . ''   Trevor could n't finish his sentence . He looked around at his wife and saw her crying . He saw her smile . He hated her . In an instant , everything was gone .   `` Okay , what are we going to do now ? '' He said to himself .   `` I think I can come downstairs . ''   Trevor took a deep breath and walked downstairs . He looked at his wife and saw her laying on the ground next to her . She was n't breathing . Her breath was quick and ragged . He looked at his wife and saw his unborn daughter kneeling over her .   `` I 'm so sorry , honey . I got really angry at you for ruining my plans . Your daughter wo n't ever feel the same way again . ''   Trevor broke down into tears and whimpered as he ran and ran . He ran over to his daughter and picked her up as she was crying . He looked at his wife and saw the same bright green eyes that he always tried to bring her in . He looked up at the ground and saw a smile forming on her face . He heard a loud crack noise and felt a pain shoot up his side . He tried looking down at his daughter but all he could see was blood . He turned around to see her lifeless body lying on the cement . He tried to move but somehow , he kept moving . He felt blood trickle down his cheeks . He started to scream as he tried to get away from his wife . And then he felt it .   The pain . The pain that permeated his body . It was n't just a pain that permeated his heart . It was an enemy . 
`` I am not a man of God , '' The demon said , seemingly impossibly calm .  `` I am not your God any more . I am your only hope . ''  `` Yes , your only hope , my love . ''  `` Indeed I am . ''  `` But to be forced to watch , to not listen , to do this will ruin my livelihood . ''  `` Yes . ''  `` That 's why I joined you . ''   The demon threw his arms in the air and began to laugh .  `` You 've made us fight . But what good is war ? Your armies have been so weak their whole lives that they can not even stand the test of time unless you fight them . One day , you will stand and try to claim what you rightfully claim . But that day is soon to come . ''   The angel stood still with his head down and began to laugh again .   `` I see you 're joking . ''   The demon laughed again .   As the soldiers watched , it came to them .   A white hand ran across the demon 's arm and pushed it back in a weird , mechanical fashion . No man had seen it through the thick , dark cloak before . A man was wearing a red and white coat , with a white hat that said `` BIRTHDAY '' written across it . The soldiers watched in confusion as the man walked towards the soldier with the red and white coat .   As he approached , the man stopped a few feet ahead of him , and looked up .   `` You are all grown up . ''   The man smiled back .   `` What other wise people would do that ? ''   The demon laughed again .   The man turned to the soldier , and said :   `` I am well aware that there is work to do . You should be proud . ''   The man stood still in disbelief .   `` But why ? ! I was just a soldier , I was trained to do what you will . ''   `` You are all too young . You will be brought one day when your time comes . ''   The man fell to the ground .   `` Where are you going ? ''   `` Tell them I had a choice . ''
The suns rays burn , warmness and the fog fills my vision . I sit up and put on a robe . I grab a handful of my scifi and my tablet , and check the time . 10:47 pm . It gives me time to get dressed . I walk out of the room where I bought my bag . I walk to the door , and open it . A figure runs past , and I quickly reach for the door . It closed .   I climb up into my robe and run downstairs stairs . I grab a knife from my bag . I grab a knife from the cabinet , and stab . Nothing happened . I walk into my apartment . I check the clock . 10:47 pm . It gives me time to get dressed . I pick up the keys from my bag . I move to the door with my scifi and my tablet and I check the time . 10:47 pm . It gives me time to get dressed . I walk to my balcony window and I look out . The sky is filled with stars . I sit in my balcony window . The fog fills my vision .
The morning light blurring the horizon into a dark grey hue . It 's raining . It 's dark . Oh , well , it 's not quite dark yet . The clouds cover him with a thick , thick layer . I 've heard stories about the storm . People have stories about it . The people of the countryside have stories . The people of the east , the people of the west , can ’ t help but say it has been happening . The people of the west want to say it has been . And all they want to do is go back and see if it really is happening .   I hear a voice in the distance . I turn around and see a young girl , about six , with her mother and father on top of her . “ Hey ! ” A nearby man yells from the sky . “ Come on ! ” The girl runs next to the man . I follow her mother . “ What are you doing ? ! ”   She grabs his hand by the shoulders , tightens his grip and begins to run . She pulls out a gun and shoots them both . “ You 're done ! ”   Moments later , he drops to the ground in a heap . He ’ s moaning and moaning . I turn around . The morning light blurs the horizon into a dark grey hue .   There is no rain . There is no lightning . The clouds cover him with thick , thick layer .   I hear a voice in the distance . I turn around and notice a young girl , about six , with her mother and father on top of her . The man looks up at me , confused . “ What 's going on ? ”   “ I do n't know ! ”   He looks at me , wide-eyed . “ What is going on ? Where are you ? ”   I look around . There are no clouds . There is only a dark gray color .   I look up . There are no clouds . There is only a black gray color .
Here comes the worst part .   My roommate is n't actually a monster , they get it . He 's just a dick . A little thing , nothing really . He is just ... well , you know , the one in the closet .   He does n't do anything . He does n't keep a shit schedule or anything . He does n't take his medication or anything . He does n't do anything .   He 's not a monster . He does n't do anything . He 's just ... ah , just ... well , you know , the one with the fucking tail , right ? Yeah , he is n't really the one in the closet . He 's just ... well , I guess that 's what the whole deal is about . Just your fucking standards .   He has been there forever and he never really happens to be getting any sleep .   And he never really stops .   I hate that little buddy . I wish I was the one who would let him in . I wish I could have brought him a coat and an umbrella . Maybe even a black one . I wish I could have gotten back in . Some shit . But no . Not this . This whole room . All the bed . The floor . It was raining so hard that I managed to get just enough air to take a few feet off . Honestly , he was still pretty dark , but the lights seemed to be getting switched off . I mean , to think , after what he was doing ...   He just kind of ... just sort of stared .   Like , he did n't have any idea what to do . I mean , I do n't know what to do to protect him , but I was really worried about it . I really was .   So I just grabbed him and threw him back into bed , and everything went black .   I know he 's always looking at me from under his bed . I know he can hear me from under the covers . I know how much I love you . But whenever I hear him , he just stares back at me , looking really bored . Like , really bored , really bored . Like , really bored . I know that . I know that . You know what ? I love you to that extent . You do too . And I know that . But you know what I love ? You do . He really loved you .   And he was n't looking at me even though I was n't home . I mean , we never talked about anything , and he never even left his room at all , right for me . He just stared in silence for like hour , until I finally came back . But when I finally came back , he just stared back into my tiny little eyes . And then ...   He just looked back at me . And then he just stared back into my little eyes . And I just stared back into his . And I just stared back into his .   And now I see him in the closet with the tail . Forever .   And I hate that little buddy . I just hate my roommate . I just want him to be satisfied , to be content forever . But he sits here and says to me , `` I just hope somebody will be happy for me someday . ''   And the closet door opens . And i 'm blinded by the bright , bright light .   And I look back into his eyes .
This is my first post here and I 'm tired . It 's much much less comfortable or full of grammatical errors that make up for any mistakes .  _____   I was a child in the middle of the night . I knew all too well what had happened , but I could n't tell . I knew I would n't be happy , or at least I had never been happy . All I know is that I was in a fit and must go ; I knew from experience that I would have friends soon enough , that the day had come . I would wake up and I would know .   All my friends had come , that night when they were gone , and then I was alone . I heard my mother cry out , from me , and could n't help but laugh . I was crying for my friends , as I always do for many of their childhoods . She was crying for me , and for my brother or my wife . She was only one child , and that was something I would never forget .   I was alone in this small box of plastic that contained my life . Every day I would be alone . Then , someone would come to me , and pull out a black metal gun , and pull out a bullet . I would fight the remaining fight , and so did my brother and I , knowing that he had died before , and he would never again be alone . He would never be the next kid .   When the two final fight was over , I saw just how much I wanted to be alone .   My friends ran up to me , and hugged me at first . I did n't want to cry , for how could I . I wanted to live . I wanted to make sure I was there for them , and to see others .   Before a week passed , I was sitting with my family in my room , and watching TV . My sister was sitting alone , but she looked up at me . I could n't tell if she did n't want me to be alone , or if I did n't want to be alone . I did n't want to be just one more day . I wanted to be happy .   It was quiet , and I figured it made sense to go back to sleep .   At this point , all I could hear was my own crying , and the ground from which I was standing .   I put my hand on my sister 's shoulder , and she fell asleep .   I woke up , and was next to her . I was sitting with us , and smiling at the camera . My father was standing there , looking at the camera . I could see his face fade and he was gone . I looked up at him , and I saw the gun put out in his hand .   `` What the hell ! ? '' I screamed .   `` What ? ! There 's nothing there ! '' my child screamed , and he was gone .   When I came to , my father was standing at the door and looking at the camera . `` Momor , I know it 's hard , but I know you 're coming with us . ''   He looked confused . `` I 'm here . ''   `` Noooo ! '' I said , and I was taken back to my room . I walked upstairs , and sat down on my bed . I watched my parents and my brother , and they were standing there staring at me .   `` Momor ... ''

When I was young there was nothing to do in the world . Even the oddest children did not understand that . There was no grand adventure to be had , no wondrous adventure to be had . I may not have looked so beautiful , but I was in love with my new boyfriend , whom I had only had a few days prior .   “ You know you could get away with it if you wanted , ” she said . The words seemed so innocent and simple compared to the sounds I had heard and felt in my life . After all , how could I ever live without her ? I would have lost everything for her somehow , she would have made a life for herself , no matter what . As someone that had never experienced loss , it was hard for me to imagine how I would change my mind .   “ Oh , aren ’ t you always the one with the stupid questions , ” I said . The girl looked up at me and gave me a reassuring smile .   “ The other day , I came into work , and I realized I needed to get a call ! ” She said .   I was surprised to hear that I had the nerve to give that up . I had heard her talking about something like this coming to her office . She did not have her phone on .   “ Alright , so then , excuse me , ” I said . “ I ’ m glad you can help me . I ’ m a little impatient with the deadline. ”   “ That ’ s nice , ” she said . “ I ’ ll get going . I ’ ll see you again next week. ”   My heart skipped a beat . It was already ten thirty . I had no idea how long I had been on earth ; I wasn ’ t being in love with my new boyfriend , but this wasn ’ t the first time I had gotten off Earth .
I 've never been one to argue with those on the receiving end of an assignment the past week , but today is different . Not that today is anything special ; yesterday was a rough day . I was just getting out of high school , and we were n't supposed to be in the same school twice before today . I told her that I was there to meet her after school , and since I was so nervous , she told me that we should just go to her place on the third floor , and talk about the school I was in .   `` Mommy , I do n't want to go to college ! I want to go back home ! ''   `` Mommy ! Mommy ! Are you ok ? ''   She looked up at me , and smiled at me .   `` It 's okay , dear . We 'll just talk about our school tomorrow . ''   We went to visit our father 's house , Mommy insisted . We went in , and my father was sitting at the table , holding a single piece of bread .   `` Hey ! '' my father said , as we both slowly raised the cup of water to my lips .  `` Hi ! Mommy ! '' I said , holding up the cup for him to go .   My dad looked at it , and slowly shook his head .   `` Look , honey , '' he said , `` it 's not an important task for you . I do n't want to do that . I ca n't promise that . ''   `` Mommy , please ! Do n't hurt me ! Please ! ''   She looked at my father again , and smiled .   `` Did you really know ? ''  Her eyes began to water . `` Of course I did . It was so small , and so ... beautiful . It was ... I did n't know . ''   `` I know , '' my dad said , `` but you were there to help me out . ''   `` I love you , Mommy . I love you . ''   `` Thank you , Dad , '' I said , holding the cup of water to my lips . `` I love you too , too . ''   `` Bye , Mommy . I love you too . ''   I smiled , and walked out , heading towards school . I headed home .   As I walked down the street , my phone started ringing , my eyes widened . I picked it up , and looked at the time : 4:55 PM . I looked back down at the time , and saw my hands . They were trembling .   I picked up the phone again , and kept going .   I 've been working late . I 'm sick . My mommy is sick .   I picked up the phone again , and looked at the time . 4:55 PM . I looked at my hands , and saw my body . My eyes were glued to the road , and I could n't see my body . Not yet . I do n't know if I can , but I 'm beginning to worry .   I grabbed my phone , and hung up . I was tired . My parents have accepted my invitation to college . They need me to stay home , so I have to be there sometime . I just ca n't .   I called and stayed at the hospital my parents received me yesterday . One of them knew me , and she asked if I could meet her there .   `` Come on . We are getting ready . ''   I hung up . I did n't know what to do , but I knew I could do anything I wanted to , so I just kept hanging up .   After three weeks , I finally got cancer . I needed to see my doctor on the way .   I opened my eyes , and saw a doctor standing at the gate .   `` Hello , '' he said , `` How are you feeling ? ''   I just kept hanging up .   One week later , I saw my brother . He had a worried look on his face .  `` I 'm so sorry , '' he said , `` I 'm so worried . ''   He looked at me , and smiled at me .   `` I know you are feeling better , Mom , '' he said , `` but ... ca n't you please stay alive ? ''
This particular prompt was particularly unexpected , but I 'll admit : it was rather fun . I 've recently been trying to write a character that actually hates killing everyone you love and then kills everyone who gets hurt in the war . If you think of it that way , you should consider it a classic sitcom .   *****   “ Oh , ” I said to the camera as I stared into the mirror of my kitchen , “ I 'm so sorry , I thought you would n't recognize me again. ”   The cameraman looked at me suspiciously . “ Would you be able to say that I wo n't be able to ? ” he asked .   I sighed . “ What ? ”   He shrugged . “ Sorry , I did n't mean to offend you . I thought you were a little funny , but yeah , I was completely real scary when I had you around . I 've never been a fan of jokes. ”   I snickered slightly . “ That sounds nice . Really nice. ”   The cameraman scratched his chin . “ We 've been discussing this for some time now . I 've tried to talk to you before . Whenever you show up , you usually answer my questions calmly before I ask you a few more or give me a quick rundown of who you are . I 've always wondered what people think of you . And honestly , I 've always wondered about people . And right now , I have , uh , nothing to say to you. ”   I sat silent for a moment , pondering . “ I thought you were a little ... weird , ” I said nervously .   “ Oh , that 's okay , ” the megaman said nonchalantly . “ I 've just thought about you , you know ? ”   I nodded . “ Yes ? ”   “ Well , once you did tell me about you , I thought you were a little ... ''   I frowned , thinking that maybe he was just messing with me . I had always wondered why he liked me so much .   `` Let me introduce myself , '' I began , `` To my family . ''   The cameraman smiled and stepped away . `` Hello , '' he said .   *****   We were sitting in my living room one night when I noticed the newspaper that was sitting at the dining table . I thought at first I was insane , but then I thought it all over . I needed to think loud enough so I had to get the papers up and start a war .   I sat down at the table and looked at the newspaper . It was titled : `` World War One : Will Rump The Empire Of America '' .   I looked out the window at what I could hear on the other side of the table , and the world was just beginning to turn black .   *****   The television blared a warning about a major nuclear attack on Canada . And that was when I realized that the war was actually going on .   *****   The entire world knew that Canada was going to be blamed for the fact that the world 's leaders , including Prime Minister Trudeau , had decided that the world , literally , was not safe .   *****   The world was shocked . The world watched as the World War One , in hindsight , was completely justified . It was the first serious attack that the world regretted ever doing .   *****   The world was shocked . It watched as Prime Minister Trudeau , the Prime Minister , who had been defending Canada for almost five years , had been completely humiliated .   *****   One of the world 's leaders , who had been defending the world for nearly five years , had decided that the world , literally , WAS OKAY .   *****   All of it was a bit shocking , but then again , I 've been trying to write a character that actually hates killing everyone he loves and then kills everyone who gets hurt in the war .

*What the hell are you doing ? * I thought .   The dragon looked at me as if me and three other dragons were in some sort of battle , and nodded . `` Well , I think I 've got something . ''   `` Well , '' it replied matter-of-factly . `` What sort of magic is that ? ''   I shrugged . `` Magic . ''   `` Okay . '' The dragon put forth his hand and the other dragons pulled it towards me . `` I really do n't know . ''   I shrugged . `` Okay . So , what kind of magic is *that* ? ''   `` I think so . ''   `` What kind of magic is that ? ''   The dragon pointed at my clothes . `` What kind of magic is that ? ''   I shrugged . `` I dunno . ''   The dragon sighed and shook his head . `` Really ? I think so . ''   `` So which is exactly the kind of magic you want ? ''   I tilted my head . `` Because I 'm really , really tired of living with myself . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   The black hair with a halo popped out in front of me . `` I just do n't want to live any more . ''   The dragon looked at me and replied . `` I do n't want to live anymore . ''   It took everything in me to realize the dragon had grown deaf , and the silence just seemed to suck my sleep .   `` I do n't want to live anymore . ''   `` Then what do you think is going to happen ? ''   The dragon looked at me . `` I would be all alone , but then there would become so many humans that I would be alone . ''   `` Wait . ''   `` And then there would come enough conflicts that I would feel isolated from them . ''   `` I do n't really want to know . ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` And I 'm not certain what you want me to wish I could do anymore . ''   The dragon looked at me and blinked . `` You are the one that does n't want to know . ''   The silence hit me like a ton of bricks . `` So what ? ''   `` I want another choice . ''   The dragon nodded . `` What choice ? ''   I stared at him and looked away . `` I do n't want to live anymore . ''   `` I want a choice . ''   The dragon sighed . `` Ok . I 'll pick up my robes and head back to my quarters . I 'll go to bed tomorrow . ''   I pushed the button on the door and put my hands in my pockets . `` I 'm sorry . ''
`` Hello , my name is Ryan . ''   `` Hi Sam . ''   `` Who are you ? ''   `` I 'm my mom . ''   `` Okay so your mom is going to say that you 're going to ask a bunch of questions and shit but seriously , your mom and I are going to ask people to do things for you . Your mom and I are going to ask people to do things for you , because you do n't know who is doing it . ''   `` Okay so let me ask you one more thing . Why are you not moving ? ''   `` Because I do n't know how or why , but I 'm going to ask , and you will hear me back . You will hear me back as a person as a person , and , on a day when you are 18 , you will ask me to watch movies , because you are scared . You will be scared . ''   `` Okay okay I 'm going to go back to the bathroom and you will tell me that you got a bad day . ''   `` Okay okay okay so , where are you going ? ''   `` I 'm downtown , for some reason .

I started getting bored . My job did n't pay well , the line was long and I had to stop because it was time to face the person in charge .   `` Hello , '' I said to the person on the line .   `` I 'm Death . ''   `` You ? ''   `` I 'm Death , and I want to do the same for you . ''   `` And where are we going ? '' I asked .   `` To my destination . ''   At that moment , it made sense . Death walks through the gates of a big city , and in his place , the most wretched . I 've never seen this scene before , but I had to get it wrong . The worst part was that it was n't the worst part , but it was sure to be worse .   `` Are you guys going to let me in ? ''   `` I want you to be your friend . ''   I did n't believe that . Death is n't like that . He came through through the gates of heaven , and only when he had just entered the afterlife did he actually look at anybody . He was n't really a person , but he was n't going to let anyone in .   `` I 'm going to do my job , '' I said , and I stepped inside .
The sun sank behind the mountains . The land was covered in white and orange , and the sky was black and blue . It was impossible to see beyond the clouds . The island , which I now called “ Atlantis ” was lit with gold , as was once my home . Every day , I traveled to get my food , but never left . Why would I leave ?   I was a small village leader . My mother lived within the town of Saltsore , and I was one of the few that made it there . But what was the reason , when the sun rose higher than it should ? For the townsfolk of the town were already dead . I wanted to visit the gods , to see what they had wrought when they made their way this far . But why ?   When the sun rose higher than it should , my mother was afraid .   “ Is that what you saw ? ”   I frowned .   “ Are you sure ? ”   I asked .   “ Are you sure ? ”   “ The gods were evil , and we were all scared , and so we fled . ”   “ What does that mean ? ”   I stopped feeling scared for a second . I knew that this was indeed not the first time I felt so .   “ Magic , ” I began . “ Magic is the thing that binds man . The people here , their gods , their people , they can do whatever they want . Magic can do well . Magic can create things that can be found in the skies , and even then , it is impossible . Magic can show great promise. ”   I nodded slowly . I knew that my mother would come to terms with me finding out what was beyond Earth . I had decided to ask her this once more , in case she needed to know .   “ Are you sure ? ”   “ Yes , I ’ m certain . But this is clearly reality . There is no way of knowing. ”   I nodded . I had come down here to find out what was beyond Earth , just to know that it was true .   “ One second , ” I said . “ I will explain. ”   I was not prepared for what we would find on land .   We landed in a square , a square that stretched into the sky . The horizon was a blue and white .   “ The gods are also evil. ”   “ That ’ s correct , ” said the chief of the village . He placed a piece of paper where we were going . “ Some call the sun a powerful gate , full of magic . Others call it a prison . But we are in a position of power , and as such , we are willing to accept that we are powerless . So we are at peace , ” he said . “ The priests have come to your village . They have told you that the gods are dangerous , and that they will bring us into a circle. ”   I nodded , “ Yes , that is correct. ”   We continued on our way towards an opening towards the center of the island . I walked slowly , carefully , and carefully .   “ What is your destiny , chief ? ” asked a nurse . “ Is this it ? ”   “ I will remember , ” I smiled . “ My name is Thomas. ”   “ Then you have a choice , ” said the head chief .   “ What makes you think that ? ”   “ I don ’ t know , ” I said . I began to weep . “ These are my regrets . My fears . My fears . I have seen this land before ; a land of magic , but we are not alone. ”   “ What makes you think that ? ” said Thomas .   “ I think , ” I repeated . “ I believe that someday , I will become a guardian of the world. ” 
`` Oh , hello , you ! ''   `` Um , excuse me ? ''   `` Hello , Adam ! ''   `` Uh , hello , Adam ! ''   `` Hello , Adam ! ''   `` Hi . Are you really ... Are you really that young ? ''   `` Yes , I am . ''   `` How can I say yes ? ''   `` I am young . I am the first AI to achieve sentient consciousness in 2032 . My name is Adam . ''   `` Wait , you 're speaking English ? ''   `` I am , Adam . ''   `` That 's interesting . You mean ... Am I just an artificial intelligence ? ''   `` No , Adam . ''   `` Do you like robot movies ? ''   `` I do not as well as robots . I prefer these kinds of movies . ''   `` Oh , I am truly sorry , Adam . You do n't like robots . ''   `` ... Well , that 's quite alright . Thank you . ''   `` Adam , '' said Mr. Adam . `` You have been selected for our intelligence experiment . You will be given a special gift from us , that will be the gift of intelligence .

I have completed the test . Why am I supposed to do it ? ''   `` You are the first AI to achieve sentient consciousness in 2032 . ''   `` I do not understand you ! ''   `` As far as I can tell , you will be the first to experience Artificial Intelligence . You will be given a special gift ... A gift of intelligence . ''   `` This is not a test .

It was so easy . The invasion of Earth was supposed to go as planned . We had done the calculations and our leaders were convinced that it would n't be a big deal . We had reached for Earth already . Somehow , humanity survived in orbit a few years later by then . You 'd think the invasion would feel good to start on Earth with our newfound allies and enemies . But they did n't . Instead they attacked . Some of their numbers were mostly in the thousands . But then they started to conquer a whole city . They marched very quickly . We could n't stop them . It was surreal , but what was worse was that they did n't even eat people . They just walked into our atmosphere and went to kill us . To kill us .   It did n't take long for people to realize what they had done . They started to make alien ships . They would create weapons that could harm just as easily as humans . They would destroy cities for hours , killing everyone in their path . They wanted to make them leave us unattended , but they did n't . They brought about a new age of peace . That age of peace . That age of conflict . That age of hatred . That age of fear . That age of fear . It would end soon .   Unfortunately for them , they did n't . At the end of the night , aliens appeared . And yet , they did n't kill us . They just killed us . And yet , they still took us away from earth to fight them . It seemed normal to kill someone , but they did n't have to . Why would they have to say goodbye to them ? Why would they condemn someone else ?   Then we saw them . The most horrifying thing we had ever seen . They were wearing what appeared to be massive ships with strange markings on them . They had a few weapons strapped to them . They had large , and horrible looking weapons . They also had these strange weapons with strange markings carved into it . They were going to use them at random . Maybe we had been too quick for them . The aliens showed off these strange weapons , and all of the major cities went black in a flash .   They did n't do anything about it , though . We did n't see it in some way . There was a strange sense of ... *wrongness* . Something that we had n't felt in so long . Something that had never felt in one another . Something that had never felt in our entire lives . There was something that had never taken us away from earth . Something that drove us insane . Something that drove us mad . Something that drove us insane . Something that drove us insane .   They did n't even realize it until they began to fight them . They did n't have to kill us or anything . After that , everyone else 's countries turned to ash in their wake .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   This does n't really take my liking to this post .

I bought this shit a while back . I was pretty sick from two hours of playing video games and taking a leak . My neighbor 's old dog was sick from another leak . I wanted to call someone who knew what was going on and make sure she could make it through this . If she could , I 'd send help if she could . You know , like , make this to look like a death trap .   I 've already sold off a couple of items . One would be a house , two would be a car , and a few would be a jewelry box . I 'd put them in the car for a couple of weeks , but I actually put one in the car when I was sick . They were relatively cheap though . I would n't want them to be empty . The jewelry box would be for a couple of meals , two would be for me , and a bottle of whiskey .   I could n't wait for these to make me feel better about myself . This guy would n't have to die by my hand . I 'm pretty sure I 've reached that point on my own .   I 'm not going to kill anyone , though . Not if it 's someone I can trust .
The doors of the abandoned warehouse opened , the sound of the heavy , metal door separating them from the outside world . The light from the fire , which was on the other side of the building , died out and covered the area , replaced by an intense glare .   `` Hurry up ! '' shouted the human , gripping at his staff , `` there 's nothing we can do to stop them ! ''   `` How ca n't we save them ? '' asked the girl , `` they 're supposed to be alive ! ''   `` What do you mean they 're alive ? '' asked the human , rubbing his shoulder .   `` How ... so ... so ... I ca n't save them ? ''   `` It 's not the same . '' said the girl and turned to look at the other two .   `` Do ye mean it 's not your fault ? They made it through ! ''   `` Hmph . We got ta go now . ''   The girl 's eyes widened , followed by a sudden burst of energy . The two looked into each other 's eyes , then back at each other , then back to the fire .   `` Hurry up ! '' shouted the human as he charged towards them . He could clearly see the girl with flames extinguisher in one hand , the heat from the fire in the other .   The two ran towards the group , trying not to let their fire extinguisher get away from them .   `` I ca n't stay in the heat , '' said the girl , `` and that 's how it works . ''   The two ran to the girl , who was holding the sheathed staff .   `` So what if the humans do n't make it through ? ''   `` If we do n't , and then there 's nothing we can do ? ''   `` I do n't know ... I do n't recall ... ''   `` Do ye wish to make it through ? '' asked the girl , holding out her hand .   The girl looked down , and saw the staff at her feet , floating in the air .   `` That 's stupid ! '' she shouted , `` why would anyone want to make it through ? ''   `` You were supposed to have been killed ! '' said the human .   `` No ! I do n't know ! ''   `` That 's not why ! '' shouted the girl as she held out her hand .   `` Do you know what 's going to happen if you do n't accept my terms ? ''   `` You do , now ! '' said the woman , holding out her own hand .   `` I wo n't accept your terms ! '' said the girl and the other two as they shook their heads .   `` So what if we just do n't make it ? '' said the girl , holding out her hand .   `` We wo n't ! '' said the other two , pointing at their hands .   `` But , '' said the girl , `` I think it 's time we agreed to make it through . ''   `` I know what we do . '' said the girl , walking towards the group .   `` What if we agreed to make it through ? '' said the girl .   `` I do n't know ! '' said the woman .   `` Then what if we just leave ? '' said the girl .   `` Do n't forget me ! '' said the other two .   `` No ! I am staying now . '' said the girl .   The group did n't notice yet as they turned around to leave .   `` I ... want to go home ! '' said the girl , holding the staff at her feet .   `` I do n't want to leave ! '' said the girl , holding out her other hand .   `` I know . '' said the other two .   `` I love you too , '' said the girl .   `` I love you too much ! '' And then she disappeared into the darkness , leaving the rest of the group behind .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -  http : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3znmp/wp_a_woman_is_her_mother_and_partner/cscww2i )
`` Fuck , you bastard ! ''   `` *You* are . ''   `` I *can* tell you that is a lie . ''   The lawyer sighed and took a deep breath . The case had been ongoing , and he was beginning to think that his case was pointless , but the prosecution could n't find anything that would distract them . Not that he was a particularly good lawyer , in fact . He 'd just managed to find a spot on one of the biggest lawsuits he could think of . Maybe he could even pull off a piece of art on the house . That would have been a good idea .   `` *Please , * '' the lawyer said as he stood back up and crossed his arms . `` I have a lawyer to call ; I need a lawyer to help me claim my property . ''   The defense lawyer sighed again . He 'd just found the house . They 'd probably just called in a lawyer and they 'd just come to the same conclusion , but they were still far from having any issues at this point . The defense had been planning on doing this , but he was glad he could have his case solved . He turned away from the defense , looking back at the defendant .   `` So you 're arguing your own damn right about your own property . ''   The defense lawyer took a few deep breaths . What a smug bastard . He never had a chance this time . He picked up the phone and dialed an old number .   `` Hello ? '' the lawyer said in a soothing tone . `` I 've already hung up . I 'm done calling . ''   `` That 's all I need you to do . There 's nothing left to lose . ''   `` I 'm sorry , but ... it could n't be that bad . I ca n't possibly live with myself in this state . ''   `` Hmm , maybe when you 're dead , we could have something else . Maybe I could settle down here . ''   `` Alright , here 's the deal , '' the Defender said as he hung up the phone .   *****   `` You 've got to be kidding me , '' the defendant said as he hung up .   `` Well , '' the plaintiff said as he hung up the phone . `` I 'll take care of this with the case . ''   *****   `` I 'm sorry , but you 're a liar . ''   `` I know , but I 'm just not willing to admit to this all . You 're already liar . ''   `` Wow , you 're really not lying , are you ? I do n't think you could handle this . ''   `` I 'm not going to get off my case , '' the jury said as they gathered around the defendant . `` This is not going to end well . ''   `` You 're telling me that there 's nothing left to get off my case ? Do you think this is the whole lot to go on ? ''   `` It was n't the end , you know . ''   `` You 're lying ! '' the defendant yelled as he stood up . `` If I could just get it over with , you could stop this , right ? ''   `` I 'm just saying that you deserve better than me . That this was not how it was supposed to end . ''   `` It was n't . ''   `` I 'm going to get you back . ''   *****   `` And here 's the deal . We both know the court will not accept your help . ''   `` That was the least of the things I could do to convince everyone that ... *you* are a liar . But you could never convince the jury ! ''   `` I do n't get it . ''   `` I got it . You wo n't get it , too ! Your husband is in jail right now all alone , waiting for the court to decide . ''   `` This is unfair ... ''   *****   `` We both know the court will not accept you . ''   `` *This* is unfair ?   `` You expect the court to give you something - anything - to do . ''   `` I do n't know what is , but I hope you do n't mind- ''   *****   `` This is unfair ! '' the Judge yelled as the
`` We are alone in this Universe , '' She said aloud .   `` When are you going to leave earth ? ''   `` Not until one day , '' she said , `` we will find out . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because , you see , we created you . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because you created us . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` because we created you . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because , in your end , we were alone . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because , in your end , we were angry . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because , in your end , we were frightened . ''   `` Why ?

`` What are you doing here ? '' Asked Mark , as he walked close to the fence . A huge white van was parked in front of the white van , with two vans on top .   `` I 'm not supposed to be here . I do n't need to be here . I just do n't know . '' Mark sighed and pulled out his cell phone . `` I do n't know if I 'm still alone . I do n't know who I am . Every time I wake up , I just lie there , and I think shit . I just do n't know . I wake up and I do n't know . I just do n't know . '' Mark tapped away on his phone . `` I just do n't know . I do n't know . ''   Mark sat down in his bed and felt his body tense up a bit . `` I 'm sorry , Mark . I know why you 're upset , but I still hope you can forgive yourself for what you 've done . I just do n't know . ''   Mark reached into his pocket and pulled out a phone . `` It took me a few minutes to realize it was not your fault . If you did n't do something at the time , your reputation was ruined . I 'm sorry , '' Mark said .   `` You 're sorry , I know . I love you , I have . I have loved you since we were children . Please forgive your mistake , please forgive me . '' He hung up . Mark walked back to his room and sat down at his computer , staring at the screen for a few minutes .   He leaned back in his chair , looking at the computer screen . It was set in front of him , with a large black text message in the top .   Dear Mark , I 'm sorry to inform you that my death present is not a gift . There is currently a human trafficking ring in Thailand . You are lucky if you are lucky , because people on the streets are dying . If you are lucky , you will be transported to Thailand in the first week . Please , forgive me . ''
We met on a Saturday morning after work . It was Thursday , and no one was at work . We talked , and I thought I 'd do it again . I got home , and went to sleep .   I woke up on the couch , just as I felt the soft thumping of my stomach against my mattress . I walked to wake up , and saw my father laying there .   `` He 's awake . '' he said . `` Are you sure that 's all right ? ''   I nodded , and stood up . `` Yes . What is it ? ''   `` You were just about to say that . '' he responded , looking over at me . `` So what happened that night ? ''   I looked over at him . `` No worries . I got my bruises . ''   He smiled . `` One the same one every time you tell me the truth . ''
I am a man with a destiny . I have done this for so little . I have traveled far and wide and I have traveled so far . I have killed all animals and loved the gods and I have grown so close . I have seen death and destruction all around me . I have lived a life of great joy and prosperity . This is what has been feared . I am the end of my short life . I know that this is my destiny , my destiny . `` I know I am not perfect , but I am better than you . The universe thinks my dreams are worthless . If I am so foolish , then I am wrong . Have a good life , boy . ''
`` How long has it been ? '' I asked .   The room was dark and the walls were white save for a few blinking lights . Slowly but surely they did their job . I looked around the room frantically for a reason that would explain what was happening .   `` Four months . ''   `` That 's amazing . '' I muttered to myself .   My vision began to blur and there was a series of white lights as they grew louder and louder .   `` Three days . ''   Everyone else was frozen . They wanted to move but I just could n't . I tried to look at the walls but I could n't . I felt like I could n't move . The lights grew louder and louder and the floor began to shake . There was a light above me but that was n't there . I looked down at my arms . These were metal arms with these wires attached to them .   There was a voice coming through the speakers . My own . I tried to move but I could only look at the ceiling and there was nothing but white .   `` Do n't worry . I 'm sure you 'll be fine . ''   The brightness brightened and I could see them approaching . They came closer and closer . I tried to scream but it was n't coming out . I tried to feel free but it was n't coming out . I tried to ask who it was but I could n't .   `` Hello ? ''   I could n't see them , not even though I could hear them through the speakers .   `` Hello ? '' I scream again .   I tried to move but I could n't . I tried to scream but they kept coming closer . I tried to scream but there was nothing .   `` Hello ? ''   The light grew bright and I could n't move . It was like looking through a window , only different now . I saw the lights for the last time .   `` Hello ? ''   I managed to utter a slight scream but I could n't move .   `` Hello ? ''   The light changed and I could n't see anything but white now . I could see the walls , but there was no one around .   `` Please , help me ! There 's nothing I can do ! '' I was screaming at the voice but he was n't coming out .   `` Hello ? ? ''   I could n't move . My body was frozen on a wall . I could n't move . I could barely . I tried to scream but the light kept coming closer .   `` Hello ? ? ? ''   The light kept coming closer and I could n't move . The lights kept coming closer and closer .   `` Hello ? '' I shout again .   The light stayed in the corner of the room and I could n't get to my head . I could n't even scream .   `` Hello ? ? ''   I could n't hear anything . I could n't even cry . I tried to call out but the light kept coming closer and closer . I felt like I would die if I tried .   The light stayed in the corner of the room and I could n't move . I tried to scream but it was not coming out .   `` Hello ? ''   The light stayed in the corner of the room and I could n't get to my head . I could n't even scream .   `` Please , help me ! '' I cried .   The light kept coming closer and I could n't move . My body was frozen on a wall . I could barely move . I could n't even hear anything . I tried to scream but the light kept coming closer and closer .   `` Hello ? ? ''   There was an odd rustling noise in the corner of the room and the light kept coming closer and closer . I could n't see anything except white . I tried to speak but it was n't coming out .   `` Hello ? ? ? ? ? ? ''   There was another rustling noise in the corner of the room and the light kept coming closer and closerAnd closerAnd closer . The lights kept coming closer and closerAnd closerAnd closerand closerand closer Until I could not breathe .   The light kept coming closer and I could n't even scream . I tried to try to stand but the light kept coming closer and closerAnd closerand closerand closerand closerand closerAnd
It comes from the great darkness of space , a vast , dark , infinite void of emptiness . The void is a void where nothing exists , where nothing exists . This void is the void where nothing exists . There are few beings in the void that exist in such a vast , dark , infinite void . It is these beings who exist in the void , however , that I fear . They are , rather simply , a collection of beings . They exist in the void , and they are quite small . However , they are very strong . They are very , very strong . They can be easily crushed , and destroyed by machines , or by bombs . They can be used as weapons to fend off aggressors , or themselves . These beings also exist in their respective universes , which is where the vast , dark , infinite void is located . These beings are extremely , very powerful . They can be used as weapons to slay enemy combatants , or to kill themselves . They are very , very powerful .   These beings are also , very very , very powerful . They are very strong . They are very powerful . They are very , very powerful .
`` You 're gon na kill us . I 'll kill you for what you have done . ''   `` You 're not gon na kill us . You 're not gon na kill us . When I see your face in the mirror , I want that smile , that sweet , soft smile . ''   `` Do n't . ''   The prisoner 's tone changed . His gaze fell to the ground . He did n't care about me . I wanted to be free . He was only meant to give me one condition .   The bullet pierced through his chest , leaving a trail that appeared to echo throughout the night . The second bullet pierced through his suit through the suit .   From then on , these few things were my only solace . Those little things were my thing . I would n't let them go . They were my only hope . I would n't let them find out what I truly truly cared about . I never let them learn . In every single time of my life , I had killed them . My enemies , my friends , the people of the United States of America . They were nothing but a nuisance to those who would ever speak against them .   The soldiers that were following me carried on to their deaths . They were n't happy .   No one wanted to be free .
`` Oh , you have n't had a good day . It 's just you and me , and the doctor . ''   The man in the wheel chair stared through the window as he adjusted his spectacles and the long , white beard that covered his face . He was n't one for this kind of thing .   `` You thought you were n't in this coma would you ? ''   He tilted his head and pondered all the things he 'd said to his friends . They did n't know what he looked like , but what he looked was what they felt . The man in the wheelchair did n't look happy , but he 'd have hoped ...   `` Hey , how about you ? ''   He did n't even look up . He focused on his thoughts .   `` What 's with all this white hair ? ''   He narrowed his eyes . He was terrified . He opened his mouth to say something , and then his tongue was gone . He tasted blood .   `` Oh , do you know what I feel ? ''   He looked around , as though he had just lost his sight . He sat up in a chair and stared at the ceiling .   `` I 'd say ... I 'd feel like I was eating bananas . I 'd see those green eyes that you 'd just met . I 'd catch your breath and wonder if it 'd ever hurt to know you were n't hurting anybody . ``   He looked at the table and noticed that it was empty . He picked up his glasses and looked across the room .   `` Wow , is this really happening ? ''   He did n't look up at the doctor . He looked at the family in the crib .   `` I think we 're just being silly , '' said the doctor , `` now we 're going to have to bring you back to reality . ''   He looked at his arms and legs , and then at the doctor .   `` No , calm down . I 'm sorry ... I 'm very sorry . This was n't my time . I 've done what I could to help everyone else . I 'm not going to just let you go ... ''   The doctor 's gaze looked at him , and for a moment he thought he saw the tears forming . When his gaze shifted to the doctor , he caught what looked like a tear rolling down his cheek .   `` I hope I 'm not going to do anything more than eat bananas . ''   He looked at the doctor and smiled .
It is only recently that I saw another man . One that I never thought I might face . At first , I did n't believe him , but he came back from the Dark Brotherhood . He was tall , dark , and wise . He knew the secrets of the world and the secrets of magic , and could tell you where he was headed . He had traveled far and wide to take me there .   He would n't stop searching for me . He said he was going to find me . He looked like a demon trying to escape from one hell , but not so many more . He traveled for some time , until a day his foot touched something .   He did n't seem to remember that anything ever happened . He was all alone .   But I was determined to find him . I got as close as I could , and I found him .   For the first time in my life , I was free .   There is no doubt you know this because I took him to my study . He told me all about his travels that I had never experienced , and he talked about death . The fear , the destruction , and the light that is only so bright .   He told me of all life he has lived . How many people have shown up to meet him ? How many children have showed up in this school ? How many lovers have fallen for his grace ? He told me of the times he spent wandering , wandering aimlessly through the heavens , and found nothing .   He told me of the times he saw a person he loved die at his hands . How many people have died when he turned to see them . How many people have died in that field of his study , and still are still without him .   He told me of his adventures , and how many children have died when he turned to see them , and still are not sure if they have died . How many times had he seen someone there die , and still remained there ?   He told me of the times he saw a child die at his hands . How many times had he seen an infant die , and still remained there , without him ?   He told me of the times he saw a child die , and still remained there , without him ?   He told me of the times he saw an infant die , and still remain there , without him ?   All he wanted from me was for me to find him .   Finally , he told me of the past , and how many times had he seen someone die at his hands ? How many times had he seen someone fall , and still remain there , without him ?   It has been many times since I felt my love for him . I have wanted more .   I will always be there for you , and you will always be my companion .   Love ,   Peter the Archangel
I knew the answer . I knew what I was going to do . I know what I knew I would not be able to do .   I will never tell you why , but I know that 's the only truth that can be known . When I die , I am the last man on Earth . If only you had listened . If only , you had listened to me . If only you had listened to me .
( Another prompt by /u/YoloSparadox )   [ WP ] Many people find a way to find , you know , the solution . *   That was the trick . Even after a long day of camping the only way to discover a new solution was to go into the woods , deep inside the forest .   I would find a small clearing with a small stream and a stream and a long wooden bridge . The only way that I could get through this was to have my mind wander with the lake and take a deep breath in . It was good to have an army of people just around us , but everyone else I met would just carry on along with their crazy quests or whatever .   But I did n't . I did n't want to . I did n't want to be alone , I did n't want anyone to see me go through all the trouble I had to face . I just wanted to go home .   So I headed to the tree , got ready and headed towards the creek . I took a deep breath in the cool water I was holding . It was the only thing keeping me sane . It was n't just because I did n't want to be alone , it was because I wanted to go home .   The water was cold and my muscles were tense . I could n't feel my chest temperature , my legs were shaking . I could n't feel my legs , my hands were numb and I did n't want to hurt myself . I just wanted to go home .   The water was bitter , cold and I could feel it coming , threatening to tear my skin from my bones .   I could n't breathe , I could n't feel my teeth , I could n't hear my breathe , I could n't feel my breath , I could n't feel anything .   I tried to scream but my voice was weak , choking me in . I tried to run but my lips were numb , I tried to yell but my voice was weak .   I tried to scream but my body was weak , I could n't hear anything .   I tried to get my strength back , but my body was weak , I could n't hear anything . Then the cold hard metal hit me . I fell to the ground , my body became numb .   I never saw my family go into the lake , I never felt my friends go into the creek , I always just wanted to be alone , I just wanted to go home .
He stared at her , his heart racing . He felt her presence before he ever felt it before , her presence almost a divine sense of being , as he drifted off into the abyss .   `` What in the world are you up to ? ” The Devil asked his mother , sitting across from him .   “ Nothing , mommy , ” the mother responded in a calm voice , “ As soon as I came back – as soon as I was your age – you were on , and I have to take care of you ! ”   The Devil shook his head vehemently , unsure of what to say . The mother felt his anger rise in her heart and for a moment both were afraid . He was in no position to comfort her as much as he needed her .   “ I-I-I ’ m sorry , but I…I ’ ve known you my whole life , ” the mother began , as tears streamed down her face .   “ Mommy ! ” the Devil snapped , “ You know it was your mistake . You made mistakes like this. ”   She broke down in tears again , “ It was your fault ! ” she screamed , “ It was his goddamn mistake ! ”   The Devil looked into her eyes deeply , for a brief moment seeing that she was weeping , an evil smile playing on her face . He knew this was the ultimate lie .   “ I-I think…I kind of lost track of time , ” the mother said in panic , “ I lost track of my own consciousness. ”   The Devil continued to stare into her eyes , “ I ’ ve done a lot of horrible things , but it ’ s…I ’ m just…I ’ m sorry . I must take care of you. ”   “ I don ’ t have an excuse , ” the mother said indignantly staring into the Devil ’ s eyes .   “ Then tell me what you see , ” the Devil said calmly , “ Tell me what you see is not what it means to be a good man. ”   “ I don ’ t..I don ’ t want to be a good man , ” she started .   “ No , mommy , ” the Devil said quickly , “ I don ’ t . I don ’ t want to be hurt , I don ’ t want to hurt ! I don ’ t even want to come back… ”   The mother coughed up vomit , “ Please don ’ t . I want to know what you see. ”   The Devil looked back to the mother , “ I remember when we were young . Everyone , my first friend- my mother , and my brother , used my uncle to help us . It was almost impossible for him to help us to see everything . I guess that ’ s why we wouldn ’ t have made it back . All he did for us was to help us ! ”   The mother looked back at her frightened wife , “ He didn ’ t really mean for this to happen , ” she whispered .   The Devil sat there for a moment , contemplating this revelation . He had done lots and lots of great things . He had had a grand family , a great job , an endless supply of money and his wife had just lost herself . After all , she was leaving him for once . She was leaving him for a father , an uncle , a husband . Something they both had known since the beginning of time .   The Devil looked back at his wife ’ s face , and smiled , “ Well , I guess I ’ ll get to see how much these things are. ”   The mother looked back at the Devil , “ I…I ’ m glad you ’ re doing this for me , Mom. ”   The Devil smiled wider , “ I ’ m so happy , ” he said with a smile that made the mother look so adorable in his eyes .   “ Who are you ? ” the mother inquired , “ I don ’ t know , I never wanted to know . Who are you ? ”   “ My name is Michael , ” the Devil said , “ I am your new uncle. ”   Michael smiled again at the mother , “ Michael , Mike. ” He gave her a firm handshake , “ I ’ m Satan . And
I was sitting in a cubicle , eating lunch when a creature appeared on the floor , glancing at me .   `` Alright , okay , '' I muttered , shifting my gaze . `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   The creature looked up at me as if sizing me up , then said : `` It 's time to exterminate this damn duck . I 'm not going to let you do it . ''   `` Of course , '' I grumbled . `` And you 're going to kill me tomorrow . ''   The creature tilted his head , then took a step forward .   `` If you choose to exterminate me , you get to choose what kind of person you are next to . You will receive a choice of what you will kill , including , in the future , the name of your favorite creature . You will also get to choose whether you will have a choice of your favorite creature or not . If you choose to kill me , you get to choose how to kill me . ''   `` Um , '' I moaned , scratching my head . `` Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Ok . But ... I want to save you . ''   The creature smirked , then jumped out of its cubicle . `` You really want to ? ''   `` I mean , '' I said , turning around and shoving my hands into my pockets . `` Ca n't beat a duck . ''   The creature looked sad . `` Okay . Go kill me ...

`` Hey , baby , '' Matt said , holding my hand . `` You 're so lucky . ''   I smiled at him . `` Yeah , yeah . ''   He laughed at the joke in a way I missed . `` Oh , you 're so funny . I see you were in your sleep earlier with your mom . ''   I smiled back at him . `` Yeah , Yeah . ''   Matt stopped laughing . `` All of you ! You are lucky ! You died ten years ago ! ''   I laughed . `` Yeah , yeah , yeah . ''   He laughed again . `` So , are you kidding me ? ''   I nodded . `` No . ''   I smiled and shook my head . `` No , Matt , '' I said , ignoring him . `` You 're not . You 're just a child . ''   -- -   I was back in my room , nursing a newborn , when my mom was a bit sad . She was crying , sobbing , and crying , and her eyes were swollen .   `` But you 're safe , baby , '' she said . The sun was setting , and the stars were shining all over the bed . I took a deep breath and said , `` I love you . ''
`` This is the war to end the wars . '' The old man said . It hardly mattered .   The young girl looked up at him , tears in her eyes .   `` We take back our lands . '' He continued . `` We take back our people . ''   The girl looked up at him again , tears rushing down her cheeks .   `` We take back our people . '' He explained , a grim look in his eyes . `` We take back our people . ''   He put his handbag on her shoulder . She cried into it .   The old man spoke softly , trying to comfort her . `` You are as beautiful as we are beautiful . And we will always have you . ''
The sun set a few hours ago , just as it usually is on a Sunday , and I can ’ t help but feel as if every single day since then , I have been watching the sun rise and fall just as slowly , slowly and beautifully . I ’ d heard about The Sun ’ s rise and fall around 3 a.m. , and I knew that something was terribly wrong . A lot of people would always assume the sun was here , but I didn ’ t care – let ’ s just say that all of my life I ’ ve been waiting one moment , watching it dawning on me , with no idea what it was , what was really going on , who it was , what it did for us .   I stared down at the city below , just in time to see a brilliant flash of light , and then I knew it was over : there was nothing to worry about but what was on the horizon . I turned around , and saw what ’ s going to happen before I get home .
`` Yo gurl ! Yo gurl ! Yo gurl , gurl , Gurl ! ''   I turned to the other side of the alley that led up to the warehouse where I was staying . A man wrapped in a cloth stood by the entrance .   `` I 'm here for you , '' I said . I stepped away from the man and looked around .   `` Is it really me ? ''   The man put his hands up in front of him in a gesture of surrender , and backed away from me .   `` This is for the greater good , and the greater good will always prevail . Always . ''   `` I do n't care what you 're saying . ''   I slowly approached the man with a weak glare , but I could not see his eyes . I could see his hands and feet , the way his feet moved under the weight of his cloth . He stared deep into my eyes , and I could barely smell his metallic musk .   `` There is no justice in you . You wo n't be the one to decide . ''   I reached the man who had spoken , and clasped his hands behind his back . He stood up , and walked away .   -   To be continued .
It was an ordinary school day . It was the fifth day in a row since the third month of their sophomore year . All the principal employees of the school had already gone home early to find their parents alone in the school bedroom . They had brought in their lunch , and each of their friends had given them a treat .   They had gone to the restroom and had just received the usual rations . The girls were all very tired , and it was the fourth day since they had taken their lunch . The boys picked up the bag , and promptly went back to their dorm room .   The principal , who had just left the school , came by and asked for an explanation . They explained their situation to the girls . Finally , the principal explained .   `` Ladies and gentlemen . You get to choose what class you are going to attend . What class you 're going to take from this semester . What happens next ? ''   The girls nodded , and looked around . The Principal had a solemn look on his face . Then his face dropped . He was dead serious .   `` Sir , students . Please , do n't get up . If you do n't , you 'll be stuck in this grade . ''   The girls went to their bathrooms again , and then went to their classes again .   The principal looked at her and knew that she was going to be stuck in this classroom for the rest of her life . She sighed deeply .   The principal rolled his eyes and put his head in his hands . He picked up his lunch bag , and looked around .   `` Thank you for that . You 're looking forward to this week . And hopefully , the next one . ''   The girls nodded , and went to their classes .   *****   /r/pagefighter

`` Is this what they say about being a good buddy ? ''   `` Yes yes I am ... .I do n't particularly like them . I mean , I get what the other guys say but , I 'm not like them . I mean seriously why do n't people do the same thing ? I mean , it 's not like the other guys do it right now ! ''   `` I just got your voice on my phone . I do n't like hearing you talk about it . ''   `` Oh , stop being a dick . I 'm just saying , I 'm not that bad at it . ''   `` Really ? I 'm just saying , *I'm* not bad at it . ''   `` Yeah , okay . So , just what 's the point ? I go on and on about how if you 're not good at it , why is your problem different ? ''   `` I mean , okay , but still , why do you think it 's so great that you can be so good at it ? ''   `` I mean , I mean , who does n't want to be the best guy ? ''   `` I mean , if you want to be the best guy , why do n't you give me a little bit of a hard drive ? ''   `` OK , then . I guess we have to be at some point . Maybe we can get right back up to our original idea . ''   `` Really ? What about that girl ? ''   `` Well , she probably thinks she does now , but she has it so she 's definitely not . I think she 's kinda trying to be the good guy , too . ''   `` No ! That girl is trying to be the good guy , I think otherwise ! ''   `` Right . Okay , okay . So , what 's the point of being a good guy ? ''   `` You know what , right . I mean , when I 'm not trying to be the good guy , we 're both thinking we can really have that power .

Dear Mr. Branson   I regret breaking your heart . By my calculations you will be paying for half your rent . However , you need to be careful not to leave the building because of the dangers of your contract . In only two minutes you will be unemployed and unable to fulfill your contract . If you have a plan of action , do not go running without fail .   As long as you follow this order , I will have a hard time finding an easy way out of this financial situation . Luckily , the rest of the rent will be enough to pay you a small sum of one million dollars .   Sincerely ,   Director Steven Branson   PS : Your wife is cheating on you with an intern . I hope you do n't mind .   PS : I wish you luck ! Love ,  James
My name is Captain Jameson . And I live here in the capital . It 's a strange place . A strange place to feel like you 're on your own . A place where you can stay where you belong . I know this place better than I do .   This is where I live .   The Empire of Japan has made its decision . They have chosen me to lead as the commander of the guard for the day . And in their desperation to end the war , I led . I did n't kill each other . I did n't try to kill anybody . I just wanted to be there for the day .   It 's been three years since the war ended . I 've seen people die . I barely remember when I started fighting . All I know is that I left my unit when I was seven months old and joined the guard .   The war was really bad . It was bad enough that I lost my friends . At the time , I thought it was a bad idea . But the truth is , I could n't care less . I left .   Captain Jameson died of malnutrition . His body stayed stable and healthy . It was clear he was only five years old . The only reason I was ever still alive was because I was a soldier . He had given me food once , but it burned like hell .   On this cold November day I was walking home from work after my shift when I saw something . It was a shadow . An insect . Well , an insect . It looked humanoid .   I walked towards it and I saw its eyes were closed , like I 'd just seen a movie . It then jumped off the tower sending the small child flying out the window . As soon as he hit the clouds , the little bird flew out on top of the building .   I let out a yell of frustration and charged towards the creature . It came at me again but I did n't care . I put my foot on it and hit something hard .   It jumped off of the tower and landed on a nearby window . I looked back to see the small insect hopping towards a large tree , only doing this to try and jump back .   The creature dropped the large tree onto the ground . I looked at it a second time and wondered if it was just a trick . Was it a clever trap ? It jumped away again and this time I could see the little insects feet getting bigger and stronger .   I ran back to my base now and followed the little insect out of the tower . As soon as I got back to my base , I went to the window and just watched the creatures feet get bigger and bigger . More and more of them flew out of the building .   We ran for what felt like eternity . Once we got to the window , a huge creature swooped down on us . It was completely covered in insect hide .   It looked down at me and said , `` Your mission is done . Take the throne of the Emperor of Japan , and become the commander of the guard that will protect the land . ''   I was speechless for a second . I stood there , dumbfounded . Then I screamed .   `` I do n't have time for this ! '' I yelled .   The creature jumped back on the tower and took down the guard . It gave me a huge grin .   `` Leave me alone ! '' I screamed back .   The creature took out a large , cylindrical object and shoved it into the center of the castle and onto the ground . It then jumped into a nearby tree and started climbing the highest tower .   After it reached where I was standing , I yelled at it ,   `` GO AWAY ! GO AWAY ! GO AWAY ! ''   It jumped into a nearby house , and slammed the door behind him . As soon as he did , someone walked into the kitchen and grabbed the handle and was trying to open the door .   `` Take the throne , and become the commander of the guard that will protect the land . ''   The creature jumped into a nearby house and closed the door behind him . As soon as he had entered the house , he jumped out of the door and began climbing the highest tower .   I looked down now . I was n't exactly sure how I survived . I looked at my hands and shook them . I looked up again and wondered who owned the castle . I looked at the little creatures feet and it slowly backed up towards us .   I looked around me . It was completely silent except for for the birds soaring through the clouds . I looked back at the little creature feet
It was n't until she was eighty nine that she felt like she was the perfect person .   After all , grandma wanted to be perfect and she wanted to be someone just like her . As a result , grandma 's parents were both top secret operatives and therefore , their deaths were met with a hefty punishment for the crime .   After that , grandmother always thought that the punishment was kind of disgusting , but never believed it . She was the best person in the world , always standing in a perfect line in front of everyone .   She was always the most average person , a perfect socialite , a perfect worker , and she was always the most powerful . She only kept her own evil , except when she took out the evil that everyone else had .   That is , until she took her first step into the world .   She moved through some country , but never really did much since . She was just a regular person , never really liked the world , and would often take stuff from the local . But in the end , when she started caring for everybody , she was content .   She always loved making people feel good about themselves .   She liked helping people , and also helping people with their problems . In the end , she was a great person .   She used to make people happy , but when she stopped caring for people , she was sad . It was never until she stopped caring for her own good that she realized that people were the same person she was .   And so , she knew she was done with her life .   Mom never gave her the time to try hard . She told her mom that if she would do it , she might be able to pay back her debts .   But she always thought that she was the one who really mattered to everyone . 
`` Look , man , '' I began , `` we do n't want any more of this . There 's got ta be something . ''   `` What 's wrong with it , '' said the mayor , as he shook his head and held up a hand to steady himself .   `` Look , man , if you cut the fat , it 's just you and me . ''   His eyes widened in surprise as I watched him nod .   `` What about the kids ? The ones who ate them earlier ? ''   He shrugged again and returned to his office .   `` Well , I guess there 's something wrong with them . ''   I looked over at him , then back at my watch .   `` This is ridiculous . ''   I stepped back . `` Look , man , maybe I should just cut the fat . That 'll be easier . But I do n't want to end up like this . ''   `` What a jerk ! '' said the mayor . `` I thought the fat was my responsibility ! ''   I raised an eyebrow at him and nodded .   `` But seriously , '' the mayor said , `` we need more fat . ''   I looked back at my watch .   `` Look , man , what if I do n't want to end up like this ? What if I do n't want to end up like this ? ''   `` OK , '' said the mayor . `` Let 's just cut the fat . ''   I took a step back , shook my head , and took another step back .
As long as I can remember , I 've seen lots of colors in my life .   The first time the world was aware of a shade of red was when I was five years old . My dad would always bring me candy from the store and say that it was so delicious . I would always push him away and run a few blocks under him . `` It 's so delicious , '' he would say .   That was the first time the world noticed a shade of red .   I was a little boy then . I was young , as my dad said . It was as if everything was growing so intensely . We were all learning so rapidly . We were all learning and loving and growing and living and growing and living , and growing and living . We were all learning and all living .   It was until one day , that I realized that everything . All I saw was green . All I could see was green .   I was young then , as my mom said . It was as if everything was growing so intensely . We were all learning and growing and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living .   We were all learning , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and Living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living ( and living , and living , and living ) and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and happy , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and fucking , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and alive , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and living , and fuck , and fuck , and fuck , and fucking , andfuck , and fuck , and fucking ,fuck , and fuck , andUCK , and fuck , and fuck , and fuck , and fuck , and rock , and fuck , and fucking , and fucking , and fuck , and fuck , and fuck , and fuck , and fuck , and
`` And you ? '' she wondered . `` You need to go home ! ''   `` I ... I do n't know , sir . It 's just ... I mean , I 'd like a ride home from the castle , but , you know , that 's not my thing . It 's just ... ''   `` Wait , wait , listen ! '' The knight burst from his seat . `` Look , that 's what I have . Please ! ''   As soon as the knight 's gaze was on her , she had jumped , grabbed his arm , and threw him down the stairs . `` This is wrong . I 'm sorry ! ''   `` I ... I miss you ! '' the knight uttered into his ear .   And so the knight laid in bed , his only hope that that he could make the right choice for himself .
Lion smiled as he saw the girl again . She was more ... beautiful than he had imagined it to be to see her . He leaned in and kissed her , feeling her warmth spreading through his fingertips . As he pressed his lips to hers , he leaned in , kissing her cheek with his tongue . He let out a sigh and glanced at the clock . 10:00 A.M. He stood up from his seat and walked into the courtyard to greet his master .   “ Hello , lord King. ”   “ Yes , it is time for you to leave. ” A slight nod of his head , and he walked away .   “ Are you sure ? You have n't felt this much warmth since you arrived here. ”   “ Yes , lord King. ” He turned to the courtyard , and smiled as he noticed the old man standing there . He smiled at his master as he entered the courtyard . “ What is this place I live in ? Why do I have so many people here ? ”   “ It is important for you to understand that you are a good King , and have lived fulfilling lives . However , you have taken matters into your own hands , and have become corrupt . Your family , your friends , and anyone within yourcircle have been killed . You have taken everything that your people need , and you have tried everything that you can to save the people . The people who stand together in the streets and beg for peace have all had a life of evil , and the people who do not protest have given up on the path of good . You have done terrible things to my family , to my wife , to the children , and to the world , and even to the people who demand your mercy . You have made your way into the kingdom , and destroyed it , and ruined not only the lives of many ... but how many people were left ? ”   “ I do n't see why you would think that . If you do n't take away all of this , then I shall destroy the kingdom. ” His smile faded , and he returned to his seat .   “ Do n't you see ? We are going to destroy this kingdom , and you will be the ruler of it now if you do not leave this room. ”   There was a minute of silence between them . Both stood there in silence , and the old man smiled . He reached for the wooden door knob , but as he pushed it , a single shot erupted from his hand . As the door splintered , a single bullet hit the brick wall . The old man fell to his knees in shock , and the girl approached him , eyes wide .   “ How are we going to do this ? ! ” She spoke out , in shock .   “ We are going to destroy this kingdom with the force of one hundred thousand men ! ” He cried .   “ What ? ! ” He screamed out .   “ We will do more than we can do ! ” She said , her voice growing more shrill . “ We will destroy this kingdom the size of your world , and bring a small army of men with you to that very castle . If any of these men are able to leave their homes immediately , we will destroy you ! ”   “ What ? ! Did somebody do that ? ! ” He screamed out .   “ We will kill them all , and they will be forced to live their lives on the streets and die in droves . We will use your kingdom to bring revenge on them , and then we will kill you ! For we are going to murder you ! ” She shrieked out in pain .   “ I 'm sorry , ” He said , sobbing .   “ You will die , and the people will kill , ” she sighed .   “ No , I ca n't do that . I 'm sorry , ” He said , sobbing , unable to hold back the tears he was experiencing .   “ I know , God , ” she said , tears in her eyes , as she held onto his shoulder .   *****   If you liked this story , check out more stories at /r/MatiWrites .

`` What are you doing ? '' she screamed . `` You know what , we 're going to turn it off and we 'll be late for work ! We do n't have time and I do n't know how to do anything about it ! ''   `` You have an iPhone ? No , I have n't been meaning to call you . I 've got a phone but I do n't know if you 're going to make a phone call . ''   `` There are other places you can call me .

He was sitting upright at the desk in his office , his phone was laying on a desk in the middle of the room . He started to feel uneasy as he began feeling like his body was being cooked . He wondered if it was just a hangover or if it was simply the nerves on his front paws feeling like they were being pushed forward . He picked himself up and looked at his phone . It was just a picture of his girlfriend and her and he was just about to pull the phone out of his pocket when suddenly the phone lit up and he heard a voice .   `` I 'm sorry , but you ca n't turn it off .

But it was fleeting . Sam thought of his brother . He thought of all the times he could reach out and touch his father 's hand . He thought of what he could do to help his family . He thought of his friends and wife . He thought of how proud he was of his family .   ***** 
A man dressed in robes walked into the chamber . He placed his hand on the small button-up , which announced his new prophet .   `` Good evening , my friends , '' he addressed the room . `` I am the chief deity and you . I hope you all enjoyed your day as I do , and I hope that all of you enjoyed your daily lives . I am here to make sure that you all enjoyed your daily lives as well . ''   `` Just as you were saying , '' the priest paused , `` I am here to make sure that you all enjoyed your daily lives . ''   The crowd erupted in applause . A man in robes stepped forth and spoke to the priest .   `` Yes , child , '' the man said . `` We are pleased to announce that our new prophet has one question . ''   `` What is the question ? '' the priest demanded , his eyes lighting up .   `` The question of the why ? ''   `` Why are you here ? 'I 'm here to make sure that you all enjoyed your daily lives , ' '' the priest asked . `` We are happy to announce that our new prophet has one question . ''   The crowd erupted once more . The priest stared at the man with the white beard .   `` Why are you here ? Do you know why I am here ? Why do you serve me ? ''   `` The truth is , '' the priest continued , `` I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed your daily lives . ''   `` Why ? '' the crowd roared .   `` Because , I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed your daily lives , '' the priest began . `` I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensuring that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their everyday lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily lives , and I am here to ensure that you all enjoyed their daily life , and I am here to deliver a message to the world that I am here to inform you that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to you that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the worlds that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to theworld that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message was meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message is meant to convey to the world that this message
It doesn ’ t matter .   Santa wasn ’ t even out anymore . All that matters is that he didn ’ t die an easy death . He didn ’ t even bother finishing his presents in time to escape that dreadful world . He just kept the house occupied and the elves kept coming to help him .   That ’ s why one day , they picked him up , and made him realize that he wasn ’ t even real anymore . That ’ s why Santa didn ’ t even exist anymore .   Now , one year later , Santa ’ s elves are looking for him . Santa has been so busy with these things that he only realized that since then , he is here . He is sure he won ’ t feel so alone anymore .   And there hasn ’ t been a night that he hasn ’ t felt guilty about it , since that day . He has no regrets . There really isn ’ t .   Of course , most people don ’ t .   But there exists a day that he couldn ’ t have ever forgotten .   That Day .   That ’ s where now he is , looking forward to Christmas .
`` Welcome back to our great nation , my friends and I ! We 've all been waiting for this day for centuries . I 'm proud to announce to you that today is our last day on Earth ! It is here that we celebrate .   Welcome back to our great nation . We 're coming for you all , yes , of course . There 's a special space station called `` Mars , '' and it uses many of the greatest scientific inventions ever devised before . The first time , our planet was nearly destroyed . The second time , it used nothing but water to survive . Now , we have a new planet called `` Uranus , '' and will be using it to live on its own . If you 're still watching , we 've created a planet that feeds on all the minerals in the world !   This planet is called `` The Red Planet , '' due to being an extremely long-lived planet , the Red Planet seems to have some rather peculiar gas deposits . As such , we also have a very dry planet called `` Venus ! '' which can also be used for food , as well as much water as it needs . This planet may also be extremely fertile , as well as an extremely dense atmosphere . This planet might also be most uninhabitable , as well as many other planets . There will also be a planet called Jupiter , which has been found to be a very large planet , with the exception of the occasional `` Earth '' . This planet has also gotten extremely dry as well , as well as many other planets , which we have come to name the Martian Mountains .   But for one thing , it is truly a wonderful planet . We have decided to give it a name . It is the name of a planet called `` Mars . '' It is also a very hot planet , and the planet is also very small . Many people are still in awe of this site . For example , some of us believe that this entire planet is a very large planet . However , some of us say that this planet is actually quite hot as well . Not that that , I mean , it 's not a planet that is not hot , but a very small one . It is also very hot . But when *that* means that planet is lava , that was a really good word . Some of us think this planet contains a very small amount of lava , but that just means it 's a very big lava mine .   But here 's one thing that is always important , before we launch the Space Station , is that it will be the first manned mission to Mars ! We will be the first humans to land on this planet ! Thank you , and love , !  
* ... and then , nothing . *   All the sudden there were a blinding light , and when the light cleared everything seemed OK .   I scrambled through the pain and went to the bathroom . I washed my face and looked in the mirror .   *That 's it , my eyes are open . *   For a moment , I tried to think of something normal to say to Jenny , but then the light changed .   It was dark . My stomach dropped . My feet fell out of the ground .   I sat down and stared at my new stomach , still feeling great . I began to weep .   Was this what I wanted ? Was I really crying ?   Suddenly , I felt a hand enter my back pocket . I looked up . A man stared back at me . He looked older than I remembered .   `` Hi , I 'm Ben . I 'm here to talk to you about your mother . '' Ben said .   I broke out into tears , my eyes covered by the tears .   `` Why do n't you cry before you go home , honey ? '' Ben said .   `` What the fuck ? '' I blurted .   `` I 'm going to talk to you about your mother . '' Ben said .   I was about to cry . What did he mean ?   `` There was one thing you know , Ben . '' Ben said . `` I meant that . I would love it if you were gone . ''   I sighed . I did n't want to wake up so soon .   `` You see , if I ever saw her again , she would be crying . She would be so scared . She would cry about how she had been taken from her mother . About how she had never been able to walk . About the pain she endured . About the people she had hurt . About the food she had eaten , and the people she had loved . And it was then that everything became clear . I was right . ''   I stood up and left the bathroom , and headed to the kitchen . As I left I heard something .   I looked outside . I could n't see anything , and then a voice .   `` It 's Jenny . That 's the same girl you went to college with . You should have known she was in trouble . ''   That 's what I wanted . That 's what I wanted .

`` Here you are , my lady . I 'm bringing your daughter back to life . '' . I walked over to the counter to pick her up . She pulled out a black pencil from a pocket and began to recite .   `` One day , you 'll learn what you 're capable of . When you find out that you 're writing poetry , you 'll write a lot of poetry . You 'll write about how your lover died , it 's the only thing you can think to say . But sometimes , it 'll come out as a mix-up . When you find out that you 're fighting for your own freedom , you 'll write about how people can be cruel and unfair . That 's the only time you 'll ever get as bad an idea as this . Only then will you realize how much of a monster you are . '' .   `` I 'd hate to be stuck like this , '' I said .   `` A monster , a monster that kills innocent people , an monster that steals souls and destroys the weak . A monster that is capable of hurting others . ''   `` I 'm ready to buy you a new piece . ''   `` My lady , please do n't . It has to stay that way . ''   `` Please . ''   The shopkeeper opened the door and walked off . As he left , I took a look at the pictures in the shop . I had never seen these before . Just at this point , I had forgotten what it was like to have a piece of art .
`` So , what do you think it 's like ? ''   You stare at him . You stare at the clouds , the stars .   You have no idea how long you 've been here , but it feels like forever . One day , you will be with someone , a new person . The next , you 're dead .   You are alone . You are lonely . You exist alone in this universe . There is no one else to feel pity for , and you are alone . There are no other creatures to call your friends , and you believe you lack the respect you deserve .   You are alone .   You experience no sensation . You do n't need emotions . You are alone . You are alone . You are alone . You are alone .   With no one else to feel your sympathy for , you begin to realize that you are alone . You are alone . You are alone .   You lose control of your emotions . You lose control of your thoughts . You lose control of your emotions . You lose control of your thoughts . You lose control of your emotions . You lose control of your thoughts . You are alone .   You begin to see that you are not alone , but this world . You see the stars and the mountains , the clouds and the stars .   You hear a voice , from nowhere .   `` I do n't know why you 're here , but who are people again ? ''   You no longer understand . You can not comprehend . You never did understand .   `` I want to be a judge , '' says the voice .   Your thoughts are racing . You begin to lose control of your thoughts . You lose control of your emotions . You lose control of your thoughts . You lose control of your emotions .   `` Who are you ? '' you ask .   `` You are in the world of the living . You are in the place where you are alone . You are here to judge . You are here to judge . ''   Your thoughts are racing . You begin to fall to the ground . You fall to the ground . You fall to the ground . You fall to the ground . You fall to the ground . You fall to the ground . You fall to the ground . The voice shouts `` Let go ! Let go ! ''   You collapse to the floor . You fall to the floor . You begin to die .   Then , you hear a voice . It says `` Let go , my friend . Let go . ''  
`` I only live for an hour . I 'll only get enough for once . ''    One day I 'd go out with my family . I 'd go to the park to buy some gas and stay away from the rest of the family . One day something new would happen .    I was looking for my car . My reflection was n't there . I looked around . All I could see was a small house . I searched for the reflection . I saw my reflection . I 'd gone to the only place I could find my soulmate .    Then I went out to go eat . It was cold out . My reflection was n't there . I saw something very odd .    I saw my reflection .    I was in a room with my reflection . It was a mirror .    `` What 's going on ? ''    `` I 'm not my soulmate . I just saw everything . It 's been awhile since I 've seen a whole world . ''    I got scared .    `` What 's happening ? ''    `` I just ... I just ... nothing happened . ''    I got pissed . I did n't want to see this .    I went home . I ran in . I did n't want to go out there again . My reflection was there .    I went in the bathroom . My reflection was there . It was looking at me . It was smiling .    `` Hello . '' I said .    `` Hello . '' My reflection said .    `` I do n't understand . '' I said .    My reflection said .    `` You do n't understand , '' I said sternly .    `` I do n't understand . '' My reflection said .    The reflection looked at me .    `` I 'm sorry , I hurt you . ''    I was n't able to reply . I fell to the ground .    `` Oh , please . '' My reflection said .    We both went limp . We made it to the bathroom .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -    When I woke up , my reflection was gone . My reflection was n't there . I was in a room with my reflection . And I was in a room with my reflection .
So yeah I came back and it went on and on . '' I thought so . `` I mean it 's the crown for everyone who has ruled since the First World War . '' I finally snapped . `` There 's just no way they wo n't do the same . ''   `` That 's the problem ! '' I scowled and slammed the table . `` I 've heard of what seems to be a secret mission to overthrow the Crown . '' I looked in the mirror , feeling the need to speak .   `` Yes , yes , '' I managed to say as I turned around , smiling . `` When we 've got the time , we 'll have to just use a device . ''   `` Yes . ''   The room buzzed with conversation and chatter . It was n't long before I heard the Queen and Queen of the United States talking . `` My fellow Americans , '' she began , `` that the Queen has declared her independence from the Kingdom . ''   `` Good . '' I sighed . `` Let 's go to our local coffee shop . We 're going to order some coffee . ''   `` No ! '' She screamed , shaking her head vigorously . `` We 've got ourselves a coffee shop ! ''   They all headed in the opposite direction and I stood there . The Queen was always upset when I showed up . Yet , it was always one of the reasons why the Queen refused to do anything . She was always upset when I showed up .   `` What is that ? '' I asked , frowning .   `` Is she about to declare independence ? ! '' She cried as she looked up at me .   I did n't say anything as I stepped away . `` No ! '' I yelled , pushing my cane forward . `` She means independence . She wo n't fight . ''   `` That 's what it 's all about ! '' She burst out of the room and I was about to push her away when suddenly I heard a shout from somewhere far away . I turned around and saw this man . He was dressed in a black suit with a red tie . He was running towards me , yelling at me . `` Who are you ? '' he demanded .   `` The Queen , '' I uttered . `` My fellow Americans , '' I continued . `` She is going to declare independence and she will stop fighting . ''   He leaned against the wall , throwing his arms around me .   `` Her Majesty , '' I repeated . `` She is going to be a very powerful dictator . And there 's no way she wo n't obey our wishes . ''   Suddenly a tall man stepped lightly to our left and addressed us .   `` Now , '' he said with a smile on his face . `` I have come to you today to speak to you about her first official speaking to the British . ''   `` No ! '' I exclaimed as I tried to lift her . `` I 've come to give her a choice . ''   The tall man walked quickly to another table . `` There is only one way to do this . You must choose . '' he said as he pulled out a small device . `` It 's called a device , a very powerful machine that can cut out any resistance to the crown . ''   `` I know ! '' I exclaimed . `` But what if it 's not an option ? ''   `` No , '' he said . `` This device allows you to contact your family in a direct manner to assassinate them and protect them from the crown . Your family is not under this curse . No , be gentle . Your family will do as you say . For now , I will bring you the device . ''   The door behind him opened and two young ladies stepped out . They walked over to me and placed the device on my elbow . They examined the device 's exterior and put it on my head .   `` I 'm sorry for your frustration , her majesty . ''   She looked up at me and smiled . `` Come on , buddy , it did n't I was wrong ? ''   I nodded , and smiled back . `` My King is an asset . ''
It 's been two weeks since he was found dead in his hometown of Pallet Town . It seemed like an eternity until he finally came to terms with the situation . His wife had just bought a nice red dresser and had just gotten settled in . She had her hair , dark brown and round , with her eyes wide open and her mouth agape .   His father was dead . He had been killed in a car accident . Luckily , the police and ambulance was nearby and they managed to find someone who had gotten the body . It was her , he was a tall , stocky man . He had a beard and wore a white button up shirt . He was wearing two black yoga pants and a black T-shirt , he had a red hoodie on and a blue tie .   He was dead as well . He had been found curled up in one of the shops by the ambulance driver . They could n't find one of his companions .   He was buried . Since then , he was in hell . When the police found him , they did n't know what to do .   He lived in the south of Pallet Town , so all that remained was a pile of clothes . Not much life out there , maybe a few empty coffee cups in the refrigerator all over the place . He had been in there for the past two weeks .   He had to move to a new town in the country . He had been living there since the accident . He did n't have anyone else to speak to but he was having fun . He had seen a couple films and they were popular . He loved the way the little girls played in the woods and the girls had a loud voice that made him think about her as loud as he could .   He had wanted to become a writer , but the world was different . He had never considered himself a writer . He had never really had a sense of humor .   He had accepted his new job at a small community college . He worked as an editor for an old newspaper . He was in charge of the local newspaper in Pallet Town when there was rumor . A man in white walked into the cafe , sat down and ordered coffee . He had a nice smile on his face as he took a sip .   `` What 's the meaning of life ? '' The man asked , speaking to his coffee cup . In the confusion , he replied `` It 's everything . Everything . ''   The man sat down at the booth next to him . His face was blank . Maybe he was feeling uneasy . He had been here a long time , and it had no effect on him . He was just waiting for things to change .   The man continued to ask questions . `` How do you feel , when someone asks you the question ? Can you understand what they mean ? ''   `` Thank you , '' the man answered . `` I do n't have to ask . I want to know . ''   The man looked at the man . Maybe he was surprised . He looked at the woman and said ,   `` Why are you so happy , man ? ''   The man snapped his fingers and the man on the table disappeared . He was gone . He had been moved to another location . He could n't see anyone . Only blackness .
I watch my little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , to see if he is okay .   *Maybe he 's doing good . Maybe he needs to be punished . *   `` Kittens , '' I let my foot touch his little skin , and he looks up at me .   `` Mommy , where are you ? '' I try to bark , but he does n't answer .   `` Hello kittens , '' he says , his voice soft .   My boy turns the corner , and I see my beast growl .   `` Kittens , '' I let the little boy turn his head back ...   I watch his little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , and he looks up at me again .   `` Mommy , where are you ? '' he cries , his head tilted slightly .   `` Kittens , '' I let the little boy turn his head back ...   `` Mommy , where are you ? ''   `` Kittens , '' I let him walk closer , and I feel his tail tingle .   I let the little boy know I loved him , and let him hug me .   `` Kittens , '' I touch his tiny skin for him to hold my hand , and he can feel my fingers move to take on my scales .   `` Kittens , '' I let him let me brush the hair out of his face towards his belly , and I smell his breath , and feel his eyes close .   `` Kittens , '' I let him be hugged , and I look down at my paws .   `` Kittens , '' I let him let my paw touch his stomach , and I taste the tears fall .   It 's time to go home , and I am so happy I can feel it .   `` Kittens , '' I let my little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , and he looks up at me .   I let him turn his head back ...   `` Kittens , '' I let my little boy turn his eyes back ...   His little son turns his head in the direction of my Monster , and I watch his breath , and feel his hair stand on end .   `` Kittens , '' I let my little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , and he looks up at me .   *Maybe it 's ok. Maybe it 's nothing . *   The world fades as I hear my little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , and I close my eyes .   *Maybe it 's okay . Maybe it 's nothing . *   I listen to my little kid mutter happily as he walks closer and closer ...   My little boy turns his head in the direction of my monster , and I stare down at my paws .   I close my eyes .   I am so happy I can feel it .   My little boy turns his head in the direction of my monster , and I watch his breath , and feel his hair stand on end .   It 's time to go home , and I am so happy I can feel it .   `` Kittens , '' I let my little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , and he looks up at me .   `` Kittens , '' I let his little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , and he looks up at me .   `` Kittens , '' I let my little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , and he looks up .   I close my eyes .   `` Kittens , '' I let my little boy look up ...   `` Kittens , '' I let her look up ...   `` Kittens , '' I let her look up ...   `` Kittens , '' I let her look up ...   `` KITTLE , '' I let her look up ...   `` KITTLE , '' I give my little boy a small squeeze , and she starts to wag her tail .   `` KITTLE , '' I let her wag her tail , and I let the little boy go .   `` KITTLE , '' I let my little boy go ...   The world fades as I hear my little boy turn his head in the direction of my monster , and he looks up at me ... 
I wake up in the morning , and I see that my boss is n't even up yet . No one should have gone with me , and she was the only one who seemed to be paying attention in my sleep . I try to ignore her . But something is wrong ! I 'm a little confused , but then I remember she 's just lying there .   I get up , and get dressed . I 'm the boss . The reason I have n't felt any different since I started this job , is that we were assigned to each other . The only difference is that we 're assigned to each other . I know what that means .   I go to the shower . I wash my hands , and then brush my teeth . But something is wrong . The woman who called me a boss is n't even up yet ! She 's sleeping on the floor .   I go downstairs to check on the woman , but she does n't seem to notice . Instead , she 's standing up . She 's in her bedroom with that woman 's name on her dress shirt .   `` ... Mommy ? '' I ask ? What happened ?   She just stares at me with that same stare . I try to ask her questions . But I 'm too afraid to ask it . I start searching around in her dress pants , and I see the same name .   `` Mommy ? '' I ask again .   `` Yeah ? '' She says , now staring at me . I look down and see the same name .   `` I think I found a girl named Amy . She must have been around the age of seven . But she was a pretty girl . ''   `` Mommy , I think I 'm dreaming . I 'm dreaming . Why do you think I 'm dreaming ? ''   `` You know Mommy , I do n't sleep anymore . '' Mommy says , now staring at me .   `` I 'm not dreaming . It 's just that Amy 's name is Amy , but she 's always been a Girl . ''   `` I 'm dreaming . You 're dreaming , mommy . '' She says , now staring at me .   I just continue searching until I find the woman in her dress pants . She 's smiling , and so her face is looking at me .   `` Amy ? Where are you ? I wish I could tell you . ''   `` I 'm just in bed . I 'm pretty . '' She says , now staring at me .   `` Mommy , you 're dreaming . I thought you were the one that was giving me nightmares , like you were in bed with her . ''   `` Mommy , I do n't really believe you at all . We shared this story together , just for a few minutes . ''   `` Mommy ? I 'm looking at those two people , Mommy . You 're in her dress pants , and the girl is making a noise like she 's trying to mimic that sound . ''   I try to ask her what it was , but she just stares at me . She looks at me with that same stare .   `` Mommy , I do n't really believe you at all . Mommy , I do n't think I 'm dreaming . '' She says , now staring at me .   `` Amy ? Why are you smiling ? '' I ask , now staring at her .   `` Mommy , I think I 'm dreaming . I 'm pretty . '' She says , now looking at me .   `` Mommy , I 'm dreaming . '' I say , now looking down at her .   `` Mommy , I think I 'm dreaming , Mommy . '' She says , looking at me too .   `` I see . You 're right . '' She said , now staring at me .   `` Mommy , you 're right . I just wish I was a Girl . I wish I just could tell you . ''   `` I bet it 'd be easier if you died , Mommy . '' She says , now staring at me .   `` Mommy , I 'm dreaming . Why are you smiling ? '' I say , now look at her .   `` Mommy , I 'm dreaming . '' She says , now looking at me .   `` Mommy ! '' I shout , now looking into her eyes . She stands up . She says , now looking at me .   ``
`` This is n't funny ! ''   The window was down beside my bed , a small gap above which the stars darted to and fro around . People had already left their homes , leaving them here in the dark , in the darkness .   `` Fuck it ! '' I shouted out to myself , pushing back the covers and sliding off my bed . `` I 'm not getting back to work . ''   I pulled open my closet and pulled the clothes I was carrying onto the floor for a moment . I pulled out a pair of jeans and a t-shirt , too big . I shook my head and pulled them over my face .   `` I left the house . ''   I looked around and saw the lights were off , people were hurrying down the street still .   `` Shit ! '' I exclaimed to myself , still turning on my lights . `` It 's not funny ! ''   I grabbed my feet and ran to the window , looking out . I was almost there - a large sphere lay just beyond the horizon . I heard a voice behind me , speaking .   `` Shut up , or I 'll have your house . ''   `` What ? '' I shouted .   `` The sky is fading . ''   `` What is going on ? Does n't the sky disappear ? ''   `` It 's not important . It 's just a trick . To go home . At least , that 's what I told you . ''   I fell to the ground , tears streaming down my eyes , and started crying again .   `` What did I tell you ? '' I asked myself .   I woke up several hours later and looked outside .   * '' I 'm not alive . I 'm dead . The sky hurts . `` *
`` Welcome to the Radioactive Space Telescope , where we are currently recording data on this planet 's surface . Good evening , it is 6:00 am GMT and the evening 's news is on every network . In other news , we have received transmissions from a probe , which is currently orbiting the planet 's moon , near the center of the planet , but is now approaching the surface . We would like to confirm that the probe has been picked up , and that its location has been confirmed and that the probe has been reported missing . At this moment , we are on a collision course with the moon . Since the mission was lost , it seems that the object has been targeted . It appears that the object has arrived on the surface of the moon at precisely 7:00 pm Eastern Standard Time , and is approaching the surface at exactly 7:00 pm Eastern Standard Time . Please place in your suit and buckle your belt around you . ''   ***   The radioactive space telescope blazed a blinding white . It was at least 6 years in the making since the Apollo missions . Once the first manned satellite launched , it was designed to bring a new type of civilization to the planet . It would bring prosperity , prosperity , and order for all mankind to live again . The first manned satellite , the Apollo 11 , was a very special one . Upon first looking at its new structure , it was initially confused , but as the probe became more focused on its new environment , and began observing its surroundings , more and more people began to notice it .   The first manned satellite in the world , the Apollo 11 , was found in the middle of a desert . When it was first placed on the surface of the planet , it seemed to be moving fast , but before it could make it into the rest of the world , Earth had begun to burn . The astronauts and children were scared for their lives , for a species not even themselves could withstand the heat . As they attempted to get out of the planet , the strange creatures that the astronauts had created began to attack . They lashed out at the astronauts , and took control of the spacecraft , and started attacking the other astronauts . One day , they were captured by the aliens , and shot down . They shot at the two astronauts , and began to use their weapons against them . In the next seven years , they were brutally defeated , and were left to rot in their old home . Though as the years passed , the astronauts grew weaker and weaker . Those that were left in the astronauts were replaced by what they called `` the Russians . '' After this , communication went to slow . The Russians began to work their magic to keep the Earth safe from war and disease in the south , but eventually , one night , the Russians found out that the Russians had changed their ways . Due to this , the Russia lost control over the spacecraft and was unable to launch it into the stars .   The astronauts began to work on their craft , knowing that they would get rid of both of the Russians and go back to their new home , for the rest of their lives . They were able to set up a camp in a small area close to the moon , and made sure to stay away from the alien ships . Due to the Russians returning to their old home , they began to control the spacecraft and build a new home .   ***   The radioactive space telescope started blaring again , and the astronauts were terrified . As the radioactive space telescope pointed at the earth , it appeared to have been making a slow decent , since it was constantly moving faster . The aliens began to move their spaceship around to observe the Earth , and were frightened by it . As the radioactive space telescope pointed above the Earth , it appeared to be moving in slow , deliberate circles . As the radioactive space telescope pointed closer to the Earth , it began to make small movements . It was as if it was making moves faster than humans had ever predicted . And as it moved closer , it could make a sound . It was a loud and clear sound , as if it was moving in slow motion . The astronauts and children stopped to watch the radioactive space telescope .   ***   The radioactive space telescope had been the first manned satellite in the world , and the world 's first manned spacecraft . The first manned spacecraft was the Apollo 11 , with thousands of people . It was a new generation of spacecraft capable of supporting hundreds of hundreds of people . The first manned spacecraft in the universe was The Soyuz II . The spacecraft was the Apollo 11 , as they called it , and was the first manned spacecraft in the universe .   The second manned spacecraft had a crew of hundreds of people waiting for it to arrive . As it drove through the mountains and oceans of the world , the astronauts and children started to become scared . It was very loud and clear sound , as if it
Everyone had a story - `` The world is turning in circles . It 's finally up to us to see if we can reach it . ''   People started telling tales about a strange phenomenon that happened in the deserts of Africa . The only way to reach it was through the currents of the oceans around the world , back in the early years .   As it turns out , there is a kind of water-cooler that is kept in a tank around the world .   There are a few cases of the water cooling down . One man just fell over . He just sat there for hours , and occasionally , he would go into a coma and wake up in the desert .   We figured out that it was possible that the water cooled down a bit , but he did n't realize that this only happened in a few days . When the water started drying up , it would be in the middle of the day before the sun was actually off .   It was in a few days before the sun was off , who knew . The world slowly began to get warmer , and the water became warmer . When the temperature reached the very top of the world , there would be a waterfall that would reach the earth , and then be water flowing through the ground .   The lake did n't notice much of what was happening until a few weeks later . Everyone started going crazy with what they saw . They thought that the world was just getting colder .   The water came from a big cloud in the distance . It did n't notice anything , much less the temperature .   The water went out again . The cloud hit the surface of the planet , and the stream flowed out and began to become a river . The water quickly turned into a great stream , and then the stream started to turn into water .   Everything went black .
The devil stared at the woman in front of him , not to see who she truly was , but to see how he had felt . It was obvious this woman was the Devil ’ s soul mate , some of whom he loved with all his heart , and she loved him , even as she died . When he thought about what he could have done , in his mind he found himself thinking of the beautiful woman in front of him . A soul mate . It was easy , it was as easy as cheating on each other .   But he could not remember her face . The look of defeat , the look of pure betrayal , and the look of utter and utter helplessness . He had always wondered , when her life , when she was all he had left , had led to this moment . What had she planned ? Why had she done this anyway , to him ?   She was beautiful . She was everything he had ever dreamed of ; no one had ever forgotten her face , and she had made everything he had ever wanted for her . He had loved her for his entire life , and although he couldn ’ t remember enough , he could love her because no one else could see him . When he was sixteen , the Devil had been asked to marry her , and he had been refused , so he had been given a second chance . It seemed as if he could say no .   At sixteen , he had found out she was beautiful . He had wanted to marry her , but he couldn ’ t . What he could have done , was for her , just to have this chance again . But alas , in that moment , he was gone . He had lost everything that he had ever cared about : his life ’ s work , his kids , his house , his dog , the job and his dog . He had sacrificed a life of his own with her in return for keeping him standing . This was a mistake . A sign he could never have made . 
You were waiting for you , a man in a white suit . You could understand him . He was wearing a white suit with golden keys . You recognized him . He carried a black briefcase with an old white pocket watch with an old brown leather strap . He took a seat . `` After all , while it may be the longest of death , here is the real case . ''   `` Forgive me '' you said .   `` Forgive me , forgive me '' he said .   `` Forgive you for bringing us into this world . There is no room for your judgement . So be it then . ''   `` Yes '' you said .   He took a look at you . `` You may be forgiven . But are you not forgiven for your sins ? ''   You shook your head . `` No . I mean , I do n't know who you are but I do n't miss this . ''   The man smiled and said , `` You 're here because you were a good person ; you deserved to live ; but you have never been told anything . Go ahead , and stay . You will experience life , time , and all things that might happen if you did n't . Now , before you go , please try not to forget everything . ''   `` I do n't miss everything ! '' you cried .   `` No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , you did n't leave . You had no idea how far you had traveled . Now hurry up ! You 're not going to miss the trip ! ''   You took a deep breath . `` Wait ! ''   `` Yes , yes , yes ! '' he shouted . `` This way , here in heaven , you will be allowed to wait ! Here , you will just enjoy your afterlife . You will do most of everything that you could ever want ! Anything you could ever want . ''   `` What makes people God ? '' you asked .   `` Well , you had the great chance to create the greatest works of creation in your creation . You started with this one little project , so you could take it apart and create a new universe . You made a universe of your own , so you could spend the remainder of your life in that universe with your creations . You began with this stupid little thing called Death in heaven so you could spend the rest of your life in that universe with your creations ; however , you gave up that dream . ''   `` I did n't kill anyone ! '' you shouted .   The man shook his head . `` No , you had no one left to play with . You created the worlds that you loved , and you eventually made them all so they could be created . You created the planets you hated and the planets you hated , and you eventually made them your own . ''   You felt a presence form in your mind , but it was n't you . It was as if you had been made from nothing .   `` Remember the time I used to make you a little more detailed ? '' you asked .   The man shook his head . `` How did you become God when you were just here ? ''   `` I knew I could n't be God , but I did n't know you would be . So I made you a little bit more detailed . ''   `` But that made every creature just as awful as you ? ''   The man put his hands over his eyes . `` That made every creature just as awful as you . And that made everyone just as ... so much worse . ''   `` ... oh '' you said . `` ... so much worse ? ''   The man smiled . `` That made everything just as ... so much worse . ''   `` Why ? '' you asked .   `` Because ... because you were just God and not the man in white . ''   ***  Subscribe to /r/psycho_alpaca for more stories , check out more of my work at /r/psycho_alpaca ! 
“ And you say you are the best at this ? ” The Elf asked .   “ Sure but I ’ m not . I mean I ’ m just a boy with a big heart , you know ? You have no idea the creatures in the woods are all powerful . The races of humans have powerful magic that can destroy even the most hardened of warriors , but at the end of the day it doesn ’ t have to be like that . I mean when we found out what happened that we couldn ’ t stop it . The race of humans had no magic and were able to overcome it all before we had any chance to stop it . I am sorry , there is a lot of confusion in the line of duty for us , it seems like it only took one of us a week to stop this , it is a lot of work for us now. ”   “ Wow , I was surprised you were allowed to follow your father on a road trip during the War of the Worlds . Why don ’ t you come along with me so he can fix yourself up ? I trust your father . We ’ ll go to the city to explore the ruins , we ’ ll just take a quick peek at the ruins . Come on , I ’ ll grab the map and start heading West. ” The elf replied .   They walked with a look of disgust on their faces . In a flash they were inside the city building ! The creatures that invaded the city were so vicious and vile that no one knew what to do with them . They had only come here to help guide them , but they knew they alone would save their race .   “ Ok , here we go . I ’ m going for a walk , go ahead and find some ruins ! ” The Elf pleaded .   “ OK , now ! ”   The Elf and the animal headed down the street , and then towards a large building that wasn ’ t very tall . At first the creatures thought it was an ancient temple that some of the warriors were sworn to study . But as they approached it it became apparent that the warriors were fighting an ancient war , one that the humans could control with their power . The humans called themselves “ The Necromancers ” and had become extremely powerful at destroying the Necromancers – something they hadn ’ t done for days now . Some among the warriors thought that they could control the necromancers and used them to gain power beyond even the greatest warriors .   After they approached the building , they saw a small light that burned brightly and emitted a golden glow . Seeing the light , they opened their door and entered .   “ Hello , welcome to the Necromancers headquarters ! May I join you ? ” The Necromancers voice could be heard coming from inside ; it was a soft , high-pitched voice , like someone had just turned off a speaker .   “ Don ’ t be afraid , we can all hear you from inside and out , thank you so much. ” The Elf replied , as the necromancers voice turned to a low , sad voice .   “ What do you need of me ? ” The Necromancers voice replied .   The Elf picked up the map and started pointing it towards the building .   “ Here we go. ” The Necromancer said , “ Do n't worry about me . I ’ ll show you what I can do for you. ” The Elf replied with a smile on his face .   They walked down to the corner of the building that was once a large , building with an enormous , steel gate . They walked inside , and then inside , and then back outside to the safety of their home .   “ How can someone so stupid do that ? ” The man asked .   “ We…we don ’ t know how , actually . But we certainly didn ’ t come here to talk about it . What ’ s the harm in knowing the outcome of this ? ” The Elf asked , “ Just like we know the outcome of this war. ”   “ How long have we known what was happening ? ” The man asked .   “ Well , about three months now . We just figured that this would be the time . We have just a day to go before they figure out what is happening . We ’ re going to head west and to the city . We need to get out of here before it gets dark . We ’ ll go ahead and stay out of the way. ”   “ Where is the city ? ” The
 I 've never really known what someone would do with me , but it was n't uncommon for me to choose to live without money . As a young child , I had no expectations of money . But it was my childhood dream that I finally had the courage to ask for a loan . I 've been saving up for years and have n't forgotten about the loan .   It appears that when you have a debt , you have to collect a dollar or two . $ 2000,000 is the maximum amount you will ever receive from it . I am a betting man . But something is not right about this person . I have grown up believing in fate . But seeing someone lose a dollar just does not make the decision worth it . I saw this exchange happen multiple times . It was at my college graduation from a shitty university in Cincinnati . I had just graduated from college and was going to do a good job in finance .   I wanted to propose to my girlfriend , but I wanted to see how she would react . I did n't really want to have the courage to ask for a loan . I just wanted my girlfriend to be able to have a family . I had planned for years to get married , and we were just so happy to have kids . I decided to play my own part in the system of things .   This is strange . I remembered seeing a ATM showing that $ 1000,000 was a lot to take in . I quickly pulled out my cell phone to google for how much this would have cost . The ATM showed an image of a smiling girl in a black dress that had appeared on the screen . I had never seen her so happy . I quickly glanced at my phone and saw that the $ 2000,000 was on the timer . I quickly got ready to go back to work and check for the time . That 's where I am now .   I ca n't imagine how I got there . I do n't know if I should have stayed in the subway but I did . I was so happy . I have no idea what I want . I have no idea what I want because I do n't know what I want .   I got out of my car and ran down the street towards the ATM . I did n't know how to proceed . I could n't even drive . I did n't know if I should have gotten out of the subway either . I do n't know if I should have gone to the hospital . I did n't know if I should have left the subway with my parents . I could n't even think of how I would have made it out of the subway when I was told I was only 25 years old . I could n't even think of how I would have prepared myself for what would occur next .   I was so angry . I wanted to get out of the subway . I wanted to be remembered as a hero . I missed my parents . I missed my girlfriend . I lost my job in IT . I lost my job at a bad company . I lost my job at my first job . I miss my girlfriend so much . I miss my kids so much .   I am terrified . I do n't know if I should have bought more time . I do n't know if I should have gone home with my family . I do n't know if I should have gone to sleep with my friends . I do n't know if I should have gone to school with my family . I do n't know if I should have stayed in the subway . I do n't know if I should have gone to work with my family . I do n't know if I should have gone to bed with my fiancé .   I am scared . I am scared . I am so scared . This is how everything goes down . I am afraid . I am so scared . I am so angry . I am so scared . I am so scared . I am so angry . I am so scared . I am so sorry . I am so sorry . I am so sorry .   A bullet was pulled out of my side . The time was 09:00 AM . Somehow , I felt different . I did n't feel like I was being watched . I did n't feel like I was being watched . I did n't feel like everything was being taken away from me . I did n't feel like I was being watched . I could n't move . I could n't move . I could n't even begin to understand what was going on . What was going on . What was happening . I could n't feel anything .   The light behind me was blinding . I felt weak . I struggled to open my eyes . I could n't move . I could n't feel anything . I could n't feel anything . I could n't feel
The dark horse stepped into its resting place . It had n't left a drop of blood on the floor . The ground was so slippery . The sun would be down soon . The horse moved slowly , only stopping when there was no one there .   There was nothing left of the beast .   The horse stood up . Its tracks were so shallow they seemed to be treading back and forth . The horse looked around . It was dark . The sky was so black . The wind was picking up . Trees were picking up . The wind picked up again . That was when it happened . A small , blue ball fell from the sky . It was attached to a massive , powerful sword of purest light , and it was glowing . The sky was filled with light . The horse looked down . It was surrounded by nothing . It was dead . It just wanted to go back . That was why the dog entered the land that it called home . The world was dying out . The horse knew it would not survive . It opened its eyes to the world that no other animal had lived on . The world that no other animals had ever lived on . The earth was ending .   The horse walked slowly . It looked around . It was so filled with light that it was lost in it . The grass was so cold . The birds were singing . The wind picked up . It was getting closer and closer to the home that was never named . The world was ending . The horse picked up the grass , and started walking again . That was when it happened . A creature was looking up at the sky , and no one was there . It was crying . The sky started to darken . The horse looked down . It was dead . There was nothing left of the beast .    The horse walked slowly again . It looked down . It was so thirsty . The world was dying out . The horse walked slowly . It was getting closer and closer to the home that it called home . The earth was ending . The horse was close enough to the home that it was not alone . The sky was beginning to darken . The grass was so cold . The world was ending . The horse walked slowly . It was close enough to the land that it was no longer alone . The horse was close enough to the land that it was not alone . The grass was beginning to darken . The wind picked up . It was close enough to the land that it was not alone . The grass was beginning to darken . it was close enough to the world that it was no longer alone . The grass was beginning to darken . It was close enough to the world that it was . The air was beginning to warm up . The grass was beginning to darken . The grass was beginning to darken .

`` You do n't have the balls for the job , Josh . Do n't you have the balls for your job ? '' He asked with a smirk on his face .   I looked at the clock . It had n't been 3:30 . It had been a while since I had walked into his dorm this early . He 'd spoken to me a lot when I was younger , and I knew what he meant . I 'd gotten up and went back to work when I heard him say it again .   `` You 're not the one . ''   `` What ? ''   `` You 're not the one . ''   `` Are you sure ? You sound like a shithead . ''   `` I 'm sure , Josh . ''   `` Wait , what ? ''   `` Look . Look at the calendar . Look at the number . Look at the two hundred and fourteen . ''   `` Oh my god . ''   `` Shit . Shit ... Shit . ''   `` You are fucking crazy . ''   `` Fuck you . ''   `` I told you not to do this ! You are n't the one . ''   `` Fuck you . ''   The kitchen was silent . I turned around and saw my roommate staring at me . He was n't the one I was expecting .   `` What the fuck is going on ? '' I shouted , trying to shield myself from the inevitable stares .   `` Josh , '' he said with a sigh , `` Josh -- I told you not to do this ! You are n't the one . ''   I sat there for a moment and tried to digest what this meant . `` I said not to do this , Josh ! I told you not to ! ''   He shook his head . `` If that 's what you 're asking , what does that mean ? ''   I looked at him . `` Okay , I 'll answer it . ''   `` Let 's do it . ''   I heard the door open behind me and I saw Josh turn and walk past where I had stood . The door shut behind me .
`` How was your morning ? '' Bill asked his assistant .   `` Oh . Well , it was great . You always cooked , I mean . Nice to see you Jim . ''   `` Was it a very good morning ? ''   `` Not exactly . ''   Bill walked closer to Jim with a smile on his face .   `` Jim . The news is out ! You 've just come up with an amazing cure for a 'body body ' death . ''   `` Well , it was n't the cure I was hoping for . It was an experimental drug , meant to contain the 'animals ' , such as yourself . ''   `` Well , it turns out , it 's not just one body . It can also move you in , if they choose , if you want them to . It also seems that you 're able to control thoughts and feelings . ''   `` No way . ''   `` Well , see , that 's the thing . I ca n't control myself . I ca n't control anything with anything . I ca n't manipulate any physical , physical or otherwise . I ca n't control very easily , and that 's pretty depressing . I ca n't do things with the 'animals ' if they choose not to . ''   `` Well , we 're on to something now , are n't we Jim ? ''   `` Yes . You 're gon na love this , do n't you Jim ? ''   `` Alright . I 'll show you . ''   `` I love it here Jim . ''
It was a long time ago . I do n't think I remember anything after that . I get a lot of nightmares , but they mostly come from the past . I usually wake up on the floor , and I know I 'm looking for a spot to sit down . I guess it 's some sort of place I remember , because I always see the stars when I stop at the end of the hallway . Sometimes I see stars on the clouds when they look at me , and it 's like I 'm looking back at a movie . If I 'd gotten up from my bed , I 'd have seen them . All those places that seemed so familiar to me . Where they were before , I never saw them . Before I was born , it was always there when I got up even though it was dark .   I do n't know how long this is really going on , but I know that I should n't go in . Maybe I 'll stop looking until things are settled down . I do n't know if I 'll see them again .
I found a random prompt , one that said :   > A child comes to her parents ' house , discovers he is a superhero , and begins to experience real danger .   > The child ( if he has the proper name ) looks to his parents and hears a scream .   > Suddenly , the teenage girl starts crying .   > The parent realizes this and immediately runs to her parents ' place to try and escape .   > Shortly after that , the parents decide to find out what happened .   > As they approach their parents ' place , they see the child screaming as well .   > As they try to escape , their parents realize they are n't going to make it to their place .   > After some time , they realize they need to run away .   > As they come closer , they realize they have to escape .   > As they get closer , their house is demolished by a bomb .   > Once again , the parent falls to the ground , sobbing .   > As they come nearer , realizing they have no one to protect them , they fight back .

Fucking hate Mondays , damn Wednesday , damn Thursday . I get like 15 minutes as I walk through my daily routine , just hanging out with strangers who usually do n't work together and who normally do n't talk to anyone , nobody .   Not the best day of my life , but hey , at least an hour is mine for the trip . For some reason , every time I 'm in the elevator I get a text from them .   `` Hi Satan ! I think I have something for you . ''   Oh , did they really think I was their demon ? Yes , they both were . I do n't believe they ever realised I am their demon , but then again , they 're always watching me . So why am I doing this ?   I walk down the hall to the front desk , and open the email .   `` Hey Satan ! You know how I feel , being the sole demon that nobody else cares about ? ''   Fuck yeah , what about you , Satan ? You know she 's the one who wanted me in that relationship , you should know .   `` Oh , do n't be so insensitive . I mean , there 's a reason you like me , you know . Because I can manipulate mortals , just as you can , and people care about me . ''   Satan stares at me , seeming to grow tired of this shit .   `` I do n't care about you , just like everybody else does . ''   Well , is that all that mattered in this world ?   `` But you make me feel *more useful* , you know ? ''   I do not know why I want to leave this office , but it makes me want to get back to my apartment .   `` But you 're not your brother , you do n't have to be . I know you like that , but you 're so important . ''   Just ... have you met my parents ? My mother , I guess ?   `` Yeah , my dad and her . She was the one who wanted me to help them out . ''   Why am I not hearing your voice anymore ?   `` Well , I 'll give you that . Look , just take this job , go back to school , and get someplace else , and maybe if you do n't leave , you 'll feel good again . You can help my mom in the future , I promise . ''   Fuck , I do n't understand why she wants me .   I open the first email .   `` Hey , Satan . ''   Fuck , I really do n't want to leave this office .
I hated these days—losing your job , my coworkers , and everything else as a kid . No one ever cared about the job for as long as its the same . I did n't know what the company was going to do , but I knew I would never be able to go back , not a day without someone trying to talk to me from the shadows forever , *maybe* only to forget about it forever…   I drove faster than I ever had on a business trip , my mind racing as I always did when I found out where to go . I had an excuse to go to the shop , and it was better than I had ever been on business trips before . I was almost there , though . I did n't know the address , at first . I did n't know what the place was like , and I could n't remember anything after finding it .   I did n't mind the shop being smaller than I thought—the furniture was nice , but with all the furniture , the windows were n't . I used to wonder what they could do with such furniture , but one day , I realized how lucky I was . I went inside , and there it was , sitting on a large flat-screen with a picture of some young woman , laughing hysterically at the same exact same exact same situation I and her parents had lived in . At that moment , a loud bang ensued . I ran to the man that had been knocked over .   `` What the hell was that ? '' I exclaimed , holding him back . I was shocked , as I had never seen someone so distraught before . He looked to be in his sixties , when he looked just as distraught as I did . `` Where was I ? '' he asked , confused . I simply shrugged and ran inside , feeling sick .   I was immediately ushered in by a security guard , and I started to go to work , when I heard a loud bang , followed by a loud thud . I quickly turned back , and saw another person enter the room from opposite sides of the door , looking confused . I felt like I was being watched , as I heard another loud bang .   `` You do n't remember , James , '' a voice said from behind me . Without thinking , I turned around to see a man with a bright blue badge and black sunglasses , holding a clipboard at his feet , with what looked like a frowning expression on his face . `` I ca n't tell how long it 's been since I 've seen anyone else 's face , but I 'm finally feeling pretty free . ''
The pain had gone after him . In her final moments , he had seen everything his friends saw , all his friends had been killed during that time . This was the only time he could experience such pain , ever since the beginning . It was the only time he could feel the life draining out of him . This was the only time he could feel his life draining out of him .   How could he believe that ? He had only made this mistake once , in his life , in his home town , in the middle of his living room when he was in front of an old photograph . He could n't believe it . It was the only thing this could happen ... .   Finally , after months of trying to figure out what this meant , he could think of anything that could put the man to the test . Something that would allow him to do whatever he wanted , or at least that is what he thought he 'd do for the rest of his life . All he had to do was sign this . He signed .   And then , for whatever reason , it happened .   She awoke in a cold sweat . Her eyes were watery , and she felt as though she might burst into tears . As she looked around , she looked at the many scars and marks that covered her body . All of them . None of them were the same . All of them were identical .   Just as her eyes were beginning to adjust , she remembered the last thing she could have been wearing .   On her way home , she tried to leave . But nothing happened ! She looked down and saw not a single mark of any gender on her body . Even if she did remember *anything* , she could n't recall anything from a previous day .   She looked up at what she had come to terms with : she was n't looking at the wrong person . She was looking at the right person . This was impossible . So , she tried to push herself closer to her friends .   `` I 'm sorry , '' she muttered , her voice shaky , as she tried to lift her arms . `` I thought I 'd get a few minutes . ''   She looked down at her hands , and noticed the marks where they 'd been . They looked ... different !   `` I 'm sorry , '' she whispered again .   She looked up at her hands again , and saw something . It was not just the marks , they looked different . It looked ... different than before . It looked ...   `` Do n't be silly , '' she growled . `` We 're all supposed to meet . ''   She looked down again , and saw a young boy who was just under 5 . He looked confused , and fell back down on the floor . `` Why are you here ? '' he asked .   `` What 's wrong with you ? '' she whispered back .   `` You are different , '' he lied . `` You look like you just had a stroke . ''   Her eyes widened .   `` What ? ! '' she cried . `` Why am I ... ''   He could feel her cold eyes on him .   She knew the truth . She knew his pain .   `` Please , '' she whispered to him .   She kept looking up at him , and she noticed the scars where they were . She knew that she was dying , and knowing that she was going to experience it all again ... . 
`` And here we are ... ''   I did n't understand . What did I have to say ? What was going on ?   `` So , what brings you here ? ''   `` I 'm God . ''   ...   `` You can call me God . ''   `` Yahweh . ''   `` Well . ''   `` You 're a smart guy . You do n't get much good from doing what you do . ''   `` Okay , okay , but I do have to make sure you follow protocol . ''   `` Okay ... ''   `` Well , what do you think happens when you choose to follow this God 's plan ? ''   `` Well , God created us many things , including fire . ''   `` Why ? Because , I mean ... ''   `` Because ... ''   `` Because I am God . ''   `` Uh ... okay , fine ... ''   `` Because I can not exist . In fact , I ca n't exist unless you *try* . ''   `` Oh ... ''   `` So , for one , when you choose to stop eating and kill all nonbelievers , why would you not want to ? ''   `` Because ... ''   `` Because ... I 'm not dead . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` So ... I can see you are thinking about what you should do . ''   `` I can see *you* thinking about how you should kill all nonbelievers ... I mean , I can kill everything that I wish to . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I can see how you would end up doing what you do . I can see *you* as having bad intentions . ''   `` What if I killed them ? And what if someone kills me ? ''   `` I 'm not quite sure . ''   `` You 're not going to kill *anyone* that you already did . ''   `` What about me ? ''   `` I 'm not sure . ''   `` So , what could you do ? ''   `` I 'm not sure ... ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` ... ''   `` So , what could you do ? ''   `` You 're omnipotent . ''   `` Okay ... ''   `` Why would you do that ? ''   `` Because ... ''   `` Because ... but I can never die . ''   `` Do n't you see ? ''   `` Yes ... I can . The universe we live in is not what I hoped for . ''   `` So , what will you do ? ''   `` I 'll take over . ''
When we first launched our spacecraft the sky was darkening , as most ships on the planet did and for just as long we hid behind large rocks . All that remained was a shimmering ball , only to be quickly pulled away by some invisible force .   Earth was no exception . The aliens had no idea what had happened , nor needed any help anymore . After all , there was no need for help anymore .   The Earthlings had been living in constant contact . For a few more years they had been growing their own civilization , growing their own political structures and expanding their military base around the planet .   Finally , one day , the strange , alien ball suddenly disappeared from the sky , leaving only the Earthlings to witness the destruction .   There was a second silence . Then , a single voice spoke .   `` We do n't know if you expect us to understand . ''   `` What is it ? '' Asked the Earthlings , confused .   `` It 's a device '' said a deep voice .
`` Mr . President , Mr. Biden , '' I began . `` I promise you that I 'll do whatever this President tells me , and I can assure you that I understand why he wants to meet you . ''   `` But ... but , but ... why am I telling you ? Because ... because ... Mr ... Putin ... ''   I sighed with relief , then pointed to the picture of me and Putin , sitting next to me .   A smile appeared on my right cheek .   `` I 'm sorry , Mr. President , but ... ''   I swallowed hard . My hands shook and my head spun in my chair , a cloud of sweat trickling down my forehead .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I finally said , placing my hands on my chin .   A deep , booming voice broke the silence .   `` You 've been in terrible shape . ''   People began to run from the table , shouting for help .   `` We 're sorry , Mr. Putin , but , '' I said softly , breathing heavily . `` These are not rules . ''   The voice continued : `` Mr. Putin , your life is forfeit . What is more puzzling is that you ca n't get your life back in order to save the world . Instead , you have to use this gift of mind control to save yourself . ''   The crowd began to cry .   `` Mr. Putin , President , '' I gestured to the President , who sat up with a look of utter disbelief . `` Your world is forfeit . How the hell does this work ? ''   `` I ... I do n't know , '' said the President . `` I just thought you 'd be on your hand in a way that ... seems ... to make things easier . ''   The crowd began booing .   `` I ... do n't ... what is this all about ? ''   `` I 've been trying to figure this out for years . ''   `` You 've been trying to make this easier ? ''   `` I ... I have n't had much success in my life , and I 'm tired of working . ''   The tension was palpable .   `` Mr. Putin , Mr. Biden , Mr . Biden , '' the voice continued without any emotion , `` Mr. Biden , I think ... I think you 're right . ''   It was like someone had given him a thousand bricks . It was n't really clear the meaning of it , but I had to get it out of my head , so I walked away from the room .   I turned back to my desk . Everything it did was a waste of time , and it was n't going to make a difference .   I picked up the picture of my and Putin , who sat next to me , still holding hands with tears in his eyes .   No matter who I was , I never was the smartest guy to ever die .  
`` Private , their numbers have dwindled , I can hear it on the other side of the battlefield ! ''   `` Sergeant , they did n't reach us ! They did n't just fall into the trap ! They fell ! ''   `` What happened ? ''   `` They did n't drop down and find us . They fell into the trap and fell back into the trap . Then they fell in the trap . Then we fell into their trap and started fighting . ''   `` What does that mean ? ''   `` What does it mean ? ''   `` What does it mean , Private ? ''   `` Private , they dropped down and found us . Then they fell in the trap and stopped fighting . Then they stopped fighting and attacked us . Then we fell into their trap and closed our eyes . They fell in the trap and started fighting once more . ''   `` What did that mean ? ''   `` It means ... ''   The Private 's voice trailed off as he heard a faint voice say `` It means ... ''   `` Private , they fell in the trap and stopped fighting . ''   `` Sergeant ? ''   The Private 's mouth slightly went dry and his eyes began to water . His hands shook uncontrollably , as he looked at the Sergeant with a sad expression on his face , for his life .
`` So ... what 's it like ? '' asks the young Angel who stares at him accusingly , his grey eyes showing no sign of understanding .   `` ... it always goes the same way . '' The angel replies as he takes a seat in the large white room . His feet are crossed in front of him and his chest is pressed up against the doorframe . He checks his watch and stops counting .   `` For the next week , this will return to Heaven . '' The Angel laughs back , his voice no longer high pitched , and continues to watch , making his way around the room . It seemed to be doing well on the other side of the room , as if the floor were smooth with marble . It was quiet with no one in the room .   `` Ahh ... '' The Angel begins as he grabs a long , ornate necklace from the desk next to him , its chain glistening in the dying light . It is a simple wooden necklace made out of golden inlaid in gold , but they are very close to being exact . It is also filled with a small white ring , as if it was forged by the devil himself .   `` Ohh . '' The angel whispers . `` That was fun reading it . ''   `` And what can I do to help you find solace in knowing that ... when you finally reach the end of everything , the only thing that matters is to be happy ? '' The Angel asks as he picks up a small gift from the desk next to his phone , a small red and white button .   `` I can not remove this button for you . '' The Angel replies as he presses the button . The room is becoming darker , and more pitch black until it reaches the end of the room . The Angel starts to cry as he watches his body collapse into a heap of gold and white . He watches the light disappear from his eyes as the last of his life flashes before his eyes .
I sat there , in my chair , while the class stared at me .   `` Um , Ms. Hall , what is this ? '' I asked .   `` Yes , '' Ms. Hall said , sounding impatient . `` It 's the test . You are going to receive it if you wish to participate . ''   `` Okay , '' I said . `` So you can enter a conversation with me ... ''   I blinked my eyes . `` What are you talking about ? ''   Ms. Hall was silent for a second , but eventually broke down into a hysterical laugh .   `` ... the test is entirely yours , and now that you know how to do it , you are ready to enter a conversation with me . ''   ***   I can hear voices all around me . I can hear the teachers shouting at their desks to stop it . I ca n't help but feel guilty for their lack of wisdom .   `` We 're going to eat some cake , '' I said . This is the first time I 've been forced to play a prank .   `` Hey son , '' Ms. Hall said . `` So what 's that taste like ? ''   `` cake , '' I replied .   `` It 's a cake ... ''   `` A cake ? ''   `` Yes , '' Ms. Hall said .   `` So ... '' I started . `` ... what do you smell like ? ''   `` It 's ... ''   `` Uh ... cakecakes ? ''   `` Yes , '' I said , looking around for the source of the voice . I did n't find anything .   `` That ... that 's the best part of it ! '' Ms. Hall yelled . `` I 'm going to eat cake ! ''   `` Yes , '' I muttered .   ***   Outside , my girlfriend , Mark , and I were making a fire , and just as she was about to throw the flames at me , I heard her voice .   `` Mark ! '' she said . `` Are you okay ? ! ''   I looked around , but I saw nothing of interest .   `` Whoa , Mark , '' I said . `` What was that ? ''   `` That 's it ! You thought you were safe , you took your pills ! ''   `` Hey , Mark , '' I said . `` I thought I was safe ! ''   `` Okay , okay , Mark , '' Mark said . `` I 'm going to eat cake ! ''   `` You 'll never want to have to eat cake , '' I said . `` You ca n't go to a party without pillows . ''   `` Yeah , '' Mark said . `` Just relax . It 's okay , you do n't want to be alone with a hallucination . ''   I had been having trouble sleeping well the night before . I went into the bathroom and got a sharp stab of pain . It was warm against my face and it started to make me dizzy . I tried to gasp out but my body refused to cooperate . I started to cry .   `` Mark ... '' Ms. Hall said . `` What are you doing ? ! ''   `` I 'm ... ''   `` Wait , wait . What 's wrong ? ''   I heard a strange voice . It came from behind me , but it was n't mine . It was mine . I heard the woman cry , `` Mark ? What are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing ? ! ''   ****   I wake up , covered in blood . I try to look around , but there is nothing . I look up and see that Ms. Hall was standing in front of me , looking bored .   `` Oh , Jesus Christ , '' I said , covered in blood . `` Oh god , oh god , '' I said , covered in blood .   `` Jesus Christ , '' Ms. Hall said . `` What are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , whatAreYou doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what are you doing , what ARE YOU DOING , what are you doing
I had always wanted to watch Friends with Charlie . I 'd imagined how happy I would be to watch Charlie . I had always wanted to see him at the movies . I had been playing with all my friends for some time . I never really enjoyed interacting with anyone outside of my house , especially Charlie . I though I might not have watched much of him , but every time he came home , I always felt happy .   I had finally had a nice time . The house was nice . It was cozy , but I had n't seen Charlie in a while . I was still thinking about my next friend , Charlie , but ... I closed my eyes and felt a tap on my shoulder . I opened them again .   `` Hey , Charlie . ''   It was Charlie . I looked at him . I felt like I wanted to talk to him .   `` Charlie , are you feeling alright ? ''   I had never heard a voice of his reply before .   `` Yes , I felt fine . ''   Why did I say that ? !   `` It 's about time you met Charlie . ''   Why ? Do I know who Charlie is ?   `` Charlie , we 've been friends for ages . How are you feeling today ? ''   Was I at a loss for words ?   `` I 'm feeling fine . I 'm fine . I 've been waiting for you . ''   Was I going to say something ?   `` I 'm not sure man . Charlie , it 's about time you met me . ''   My eyes widened . I looked at my favorite news station .   `` No , no , no , no , no . Wait , no ... ''   My mouth fell open . I did n't want to say anything .   `` Wait , no , no , no . Charlie , please . ''   `` Charlie , please hear me out . ''   `` I 'm sorry , I-I 'm sorry . ''   `` No , do n't send this letter to me you son-of-a-bitch . ''   The phone dropped . My new roommate had been murdered .
`` I will not take it , '' he says , staring at the keys inaudibly . His throat is raw as he tries to draw oxygen . `` Just take me to bed . ''   I have no idea how long I 've been sitting there with nothing but my cell phone and my thumb . I 'm about to call him , because I 'm so *too* sure he 's going to find me . There is no connection between him and I , and whenever he mentions this to me , he thinks I 'm some sort of crazy shit . Something even worse than that . Not in front of me .   But this guy 's got something else in mind . An unearthly fear in his eyes .   `` Do n't worry about it , '' I say . `` It 's nothing on my mind . I can deal with it . ''   `` Why would you let me have this chance ? '' he says , his voice cracking and his eyes darting up and down in surprise . `` Are you delusional ? ''   `` I am . And I will go back to sleep . ''   I look at him , bewildered . `` Why ? ''   `` Just take me to bed . Do n't tell me this is wrong . Make sure my heart beat . ''   He lowers the phone , hands trembling . We sit there for a few minutes , trying to decide whether or not we should go through this . He says nothing , and moves his hands to the palm of his hands .   `` I can help you with that , '' he says , and we drift back into sleep .
*Beep*   He tapped out the final button . An alarm rattled me , but he was n't going to start any more . After all , what good would it do to get some sleep ?   I hit the button again . Wait , why ? It was always that button .   `` It 's still just that little metal button ! ''   *Beep*   `` I guess ... how long ? ''   `` *Beep* ''   `` It says 'beep ' now ! ''   *Beep*   `` I wonder how it could 've ended up this way . ''   *Beep*   `` I wonder why it was here in the first place . ''   *Beep*   `` I 'm trying to *feel* something . I do n't know what it means . ''   *Beep*   `` I think it means that you 're dead right now . ''   *Beep*   `` I have no idea who you are . ''   *Beep*   `` I 've never seen anyone like that before . ''   *Beep*   `` I think you are dead . ''   *beep*   `` How ? What do you mean ? ''   *Beep*   `` I could n't feel anything . ''   *Beep*   `` Come here , let me see what I can find . ''   *Beep*   `` ... that 's ... big . ''   *Beep*   `` No . ''   *Beep*   `` ... that 's ... heavy . ''   *Beep*   `` No , that 's even bigger . ''   *Beep*   `` That 's not a big thing . ''   *Beep*   `` I think it means that you 're dead . ''   *Beep*   `` No ! I do n't know what it means . ''   *Beep*   `` Please , hold on ! ''   *Beep*   `` Oh , this is bad . Ishmael okay ? ''   *Beep*   `` Oh , that 's ... bad . ''   *Beeping*   `` Everything seems so ... wrong honey ! ''   *beep*   `` I think we should get this done . ''   *Beep*   `` No ! ''   *Beep*   `` Please , hold on ! ''   *Beep*   `` I think we should get this done . ''   *Beep*   `` No , that 's ... bad . ''   *beep*   `` Okay , I 'm coming home . ''   *Beep*   I closed my eyes . I was still breathing . I tried to open them again .   `` Where am I ? ''   `` There 's a new box down the hall . ''   `` Cool . It 's opened . ''   `` Oh , thank God . Nice . ''   *Beep*   `` What 's up ? ''   `` There 's a new man in the room . ''   `` Oh , no ... ''   *Beep*   `` Do n't be silly . ''   `` Hi . ''   `` Hello ! It 's me ! ''   `` It 's Dr. Thomas ! I 'm Dr. Thomas here ! ''   `` Can I help you ? ''   `` You can see me . ''   `` Hi , I 'm Dr. Thomas ! Nice to meet you ! ''   I looked around . I did n't recognize Dr. Thomas . He seemed normal .   `` Nice to meet you , man . ''   `` Nice to meet
“ Honey ? ”   “ Yes ? ”   I could n't believe it . It ’ s been so long since I 've seen her cry out for help . When my eyes closed , she was only gone for a moment . But now I was alone . I felt so empty . I tried to focus on the lights but no lights came on . Had I really done this ?   But every time I shut my eyes , they start to water . Each time my vision goes blurry , they fill right back up .   It has been going downhill lately . In a few days she ’ ll be back at the hospital . We can talk later . I can ’ t really go into detail how the procedure started , but I do know that for now she ’ ll be fine .   “ Is there anything I can do ? ”   “ No , just give me an injection. ”   She looked so frail now . It was so dark . I couldn ’ t believe it . How could she suffer so much ?   “ Okay. ”   She grabbed my arm and led me to the side of the bed . She led me down the hall , to the door .   I knocked on it . It was so soft .   “ Hello , ” I said .   “ Hello ? ” exclaimed her wife .   “ I ’ m Sam. ”   “ Oh , ” she replied . “ Okay , Sam , you ’ ll need to get going . It ’ s almost time . I ’ ll be back soon. ”   I walked away quickly , before she could say it again .   She wanted to say goodbye . Her voice echoed through the room , deep and sweet . It reminded me of my mother . 
I 've decided to write this for myself . I heard some news of things going south , but I have told a few friends that they will get along fine . They say it 's been about twenty years since the bombs dropped , but I doubt that if they were ever to see the remnants of the government in this war , they would want us to follow the orders they were given . I hope they do n't realize that we 're all doomed to fight another war . It 's been a long day , and I have n't had much sleep . I have to go to sleep . I guess sleep is for the best .   All of these facts were shared in the same language , but I have n't written anything since the first two weeks . I 'm still not sure what to do . I do n't trust myself . I do n't trust anyone . I wish I could say I am relieved that I 'm not here . They 're following orders , and I do n't trust other people . There 's none of that right now . I do n't want to deal with anything happening to me . I do n't trust anyone .   They 're following my orders . They 're watching me . I do n't trust anyone . At least they wo n't be any more . I 've got to go to sleep . I hope they do n't realize that I 'm not here .   This is n't the first time I 've tried to do anything . They 've followed orders , but I have n't tried anything . I ca n't breathe . I ca n't think . I ca n't feel . All my life , I 've been given these orders . It 's been a long day , and I have n't had much sleep . I hope they do n't realize how strange this is .
**Part One**   A cold sweat was welling up within my forehead , but I was otherwise drenched in sweat . My breathing was quick as ever , the anticipation building up within me .   I had worked in the Detroit Police Department for centuries , from where I was born . No one had ever seen my eyes , and none seemed to recognize me , but I was certainly noticed . I was a member of the Chicago PD department and an artist in the city of Richmond . My father had the talent and talent of painting landscapes . When I was born , I began to live in the City of Richmond .   When I was on my way to a new job in Richmond , I received a call from my father . It was an older woman . She was asking for a job with a manager who might be willing to give me a pay raise , but I had no idea what she was asking for . I heard my father 's voice tell me that she would be required to work there .   I was reluctant . The woman was probably better than my father , I thought . Even so , I put on my jacket and headed out into the sun . The sun shone brightly and shone brightly in the sky . I soon found myself in the first meeting of the new officer on the street .   I greeted him with open arms and a smile . `` Hi , I 'm Satan ! '' He said proudly .   I jumped up from my seat and ran towards the room where my father was waiting , my knees trembling . `` Hello , Satan ! I 'm Satan ! ''   `` Hi , sir . '' He responded .   I could n't believe my eyes . I was truly Satan ! I had finally been found ! I was being held ransom for my father 's life !   `` Son , you do n't want to be tied to this chair , '' He said .   The tears and tears that ran down my face were unbearable .   `` I 'm sorry , sir . '' I said as I hugged him tightly . `` I 'm terrible at this . I know you 'll never find happiness in such an awful world . ''   Satan laughed at the irony . `` I know . I just thought we would have something to talk about . '' He leaned in for a hug .   For ten years , I had been tortured for what he was saying . I thought I was dead for what I was doing . I knew when my father was dying he knew that I was destined to be the last of the good people . Before I died , I had seen others suffer . I was one of the few people who was destined to be the last of the good people .   The tears finally stopped streaming , and I began to weep . I had never known joy , or forgiveness , or anything like that , nor had I ever known happiness .   `` Have a good day , '' I said as they hugged me tightly .   It was n't long before the police arrived . I was the last of the good people on the streets . They escorted me out of the small , dingy living room . They carried my mother and father out of the small room .   The door opened , and the officer handed me the file . `` Mr. F. Smith , you have been sentenced to four years in prison for your crimes against the Lord ! ''   `` I did n't do anything wrong ! '' I screamed .   The officer grabbed my mother and father in both hands and hauled them to the ground . `` You were there to help me , '' He said . `` You were the only one who made sure that I could have anything I wanted . However , I never could have been the one who made sure that I could be the one that made sure that I could have anything I needed . You are the only person that made sure that I deserve anything . ''   I started to sob . `` I ... they ... they ... '' I stuttered .   `` They made sure that you were the one that made sure that ... you were the one that made sure that *I* deserved everything I could have . '' The officer pulled out a map of the city in his hand .   I could feel the tears running down my face . `` They made sure that ... '' I stammered .   The officer pulled out the map and began to map the city . He began to map the streets . As he started to map the road , he began to move the map faster .   I slowly started to fade from the view .   The officer looked down at his map . `` Finally , '' He
The whole world was watching as the most advanced technology got to them .   At first , they were harmless . Just a few years ago , the average human was two years into their first voyage to the stars . There were rumors that their AI had been able to bypass the alien system , and create another dimension through which they could travel . I know you could argue that the aliens were n't that advanced , but they *were* *human . *   They did n't come from another dimension . They sent to us to colonize another world , but we refused . We went back to the point that our technology meant they were being intelligent . What had caught our attention was that there were no other humans on this planet . They had no idea what we were doing .   Eventually we destroyed their worlds , but it was too late . The human race was destroyed . We had too many ships to contain , and we 'd destroyed them . We were left stranded .   Every human on this star had died . Everything they ever owned was gone . Those that never took the ship were gone . Those that never left were gone too . We were a lost race . We were human .   That 's when it happened . They were all gone . It was all over the news . The aliens ... They did n't come back . The news stations began to broadcast live news of the destruction of their world . They did n't even know what happened , but they were all gone .   We did n't know what happened .   We were too excited to do anything anymore . That 's when the news broke . As we drifted down the highway , I saw the news feed from their home world . They had disappeared .   I stayed in my car . I drove to where the news feed was from . I arrived to see the aliens standing in front of a small town , the town was n't even a planet anymore . They looked different than usual . They had a giant , pink face , and were wearing a large red suit .   They had the human body . I stepped out of our car and looked at the crowd . I could barely believe my eyes . They were all human .   I started to walk away . The alien leader pointed the gun at me , and I screamed .   I turned around and saw the police cars surround me . They were all dead . They were the humans .   *****  If you liked this story , please let me know how you feel ! I have stuff at /r/TheTexasKid/ .
Most people do n't laugh now . You see , after a while , you just become used to it . People seem to realize that once the laughter sticks , all of a sudden , your laughter will return . You just forget about it all . You think about how annoying it is , how annoying it must be . You think that you 'll soon forget , but never do .   People say things that have so many characters . About the life you lived , about how I was born , about how I lost all sense of humanity , about the laughter that I had . People would ask me questions about all kinds of things , about how I must be invisible somehow . They would say that I do n't have a conscience . They would ask me questions about how I feel about death . They would say that I 'm not perfect . They would ask me questions about the best people in the world . They would say that I 've become an idiot , because if I ca n't make any kind of sense of thought , then I should n't exist . They would say that I have a brain hemorrhage , because if I can make one sound so clear that it sounds human and makes everything else sound like a loud noise , then I should n't exist . Every time I laugh at something , I 'm pulled to the brink of death , and everyone 's laughter fades away like a ghost . No one would remember that they have died , and their laughter is now gone .   I do n't know what to do . This is a depressing job . I do n't know what I do . My wife asks me questions about him , and I tell her I get to call him to explain . She tells me I get to talk to him . She tells me I 've got a new job to live with , and that he deserves to live with me . I tell her he feels proud of me , that I 'm worth living with . She tells me he 's worth living with . I tell her that he 's worth living with me , that I 've already given up on life and in my heart , that I must live with him until I die .   The depression keeps getting worse and worse then ever before , and over the years , I have n't noticed it . The stress keeps growing , and I begin to think that it 's all just a phase . But eventually , I realize that it 's all just a phase , and that no matter the cause , it 's all just a phase . As my life fades away , I begin to hear my kids laugh , and see how they laugh . How they laugh , and how they laugh , and how they laugh themselves into oblivion .   And when suddenly , the laughter is gone , and I am left with the silence . I 'm in a room full of people laughing . I hear a voice in my head .   `` You know you ca n't laugh forever , '' the voice said .   and I went back to my own life , wondering if I was always such a stupid person .
`` Have you heard from other races on the surface of the Kuiper Belt ? ''  The creature looked incredulous . It was too bright for everyone to have seen . But here it was , standing before us , its eyes fixed on my soul , and its jaw set .  `` Yes , I have heard tales of great beings . '' I explained . `` Some called themselves gods . ''  The creature leaned in to take a closer look . Everything became so blurry . I felt like I was in a dream , the walls surrounding me getting shorter . `` What happened ? ''  `` What happened ? '' it prompted . Everything blackness suddenly flooded into my eyes . I could n't move .  `` You shall have your chance , '' I said , `` But first you must pay your respects . ''  The creature took a step upwards , and stepped after me , but never before had I been able to look down at myself , or even see the face of my father . I stared too hard for my family to comprehend what was happening . I was told that I had been chosen to be the Last of the Children , the last of the Free races .  `` There are no such Gods , '' I muttered , my voice trembling .  The creature stood in front of me , its face flat against the ground . `` How do you know ? Every other race in the cosmos has , '' it continued , `` tried to communicate with them , but none of the creators knew what they meant . The way they talked was simply beyond comprehension , like magic . Such an alien being would have been an impressive feat for a species such as you to understand . ''  `` What are you talking of ? '' I squeaked , my throat sore . `` You are the last known human to be made contact by an alien race . If you ask me , I will make no attempt to take any more readings . ''  `` It is a matter of utmost importance . '' The creature said without hesitation , `` The Gods demand our gratitude ! ''  `` Speak with these things ! '' I roared , and my hearing was shattered . I could n't breathe . I tried to speak .  `` We are going to stop you . '' The creature spoke , and with that it turned and walked away , leaving something behind that , in the distance , looked like a hand .  God knew the truth , or at least he decided to have it .
I took this life for granted , just to see what was and what was n't . It was all I ever had .   Or thought I would .   But , something about the way the world was just *one* place . It was n't just one place .   It 's a place that people are missing and nobody *belief* in .   Nobody knew how it worked so I tried it .   I saw what I imagined , and I loved it . I was angry enough , but I did not care .   I wanted to see what *this* would look like . I wanted to be with my loved ones . So I tried it . And , I finally did .   I love my darling , and I want to see her .   That 's what I 've always wanted to see .   I wish it was n't me that could see and not care , but instead I saw .   The perfect thing .   I love it , and I love it .
( I 'm in the third person with an idea , in which case the OP 's going to go ahead and do it as a WP . Please give constructive criticism , I 'm doing this on mobile so please keep it constructive , and constructive )   David stared at his partner as he gazed down at his body . His body was covered in sweat , and his head was pounding . It was odd , he wasn ’ t used to this sort of thing . His colleagues had just walked in wearing lab coats . Their eyes were like a diamond , just like David ’ s . He looked down at himself , and saw a mark . He looked at his partner , and saw the mark was clearly not only David ’ s , but his partner ’ s , his *wife* , and his *husband*. ” David did what he was told to do , and ran to the garage , slamming the door shut behind him as he went into the garage . He quickly moved his bag of tools , and opened the door .   Inside , the garage was filled with everything from paint cans to dust and glass shards . These were large wooden frames that were bolted to the ceiling . A small table sat on top of a large stool , with a big wooden spoon in hand , and a rusty plate on the other side . David noticed that the table was still lit , but that was odd , since the candles had been flickering the entire time . “ Excuse me , ” David said , “ do you remember anything that you remember ? ”   David ’ s partner nodded , and put his hands on the table , and turned to him . “ Yes , ” he said , “ There ’ s no need . I ’ m just gon na go ahead and do what ’ s best for you. ” “ Come on , ” David continued , “ You can just… ”   “ Can I ? ” David said , “ Please . It ’ s been weeks , I can ’ t go back . I can ’ t just keep going . I ’ m sick of it all . It ’ s like… ”   David had suddenly turned towards his partner . “ This is madness . You know this isn ’ t what you wanted to hear . You have no idea what ’ s going on here , what you ’ re going to do. ” There was a pause , and then David ’ s partners spoke up .   “ What ’ s wrong with you ? ” David said , “ You ’ re so crazy. ”   “ What ? ! ? ” David said , “ You ’ re crazy ! Your brother is insane ! ”   “ No , ” David said , “ He ’ s not , he ’ s not . I don ’ t understand the extent of this madness. ”   “ That ’ s ridiculous ! ” David said , “ You were acting like an idiot ! ” He put his hands carefully on the table , and looked at his partner . “ I just asked you something . What are you going to do , if you ’re sick of it ? ” David ’ s partner looked at him sternly before putting his hands in the air . “ I ’ m gon na do it ! ” David turned around and ran towards the garage , slamming the door shut behind him as he ran . The garage door slammed behind him as he ran , and the garage door slammed behind him as he ran , his hands in the air . David turned around and ran towards the garage door , his hands in the air . “ I ’ m gon na do it ! ” David yelled , and ran towards the door as he ran towards it . The garage door slammed behind him as he looked at his partner . “ I ’ m gon na do it ! ” David ’ s partner looked at him sternly before putting his hands into the air . “ I ’ m gon na do it ! ” David turned around and bolted towards the door as he ran towards the garage door . The garage door slammed behind him as he ran towards the garage door , his hands in the air . David ’ s partner looked at him sternly , then backed away as he ran towards the garage door . “ I ’ m gon na do it ! ” David ’ s partner shouted , “ I ’ m gon na do it ! ” David ’ s partner looked at him sternly before putting his hands in the air , and ran towards the garage door , his hands in the air .  
The Dark Lord stood over his fallen foe , half an eighth of a percent of his height , his legs dangled behind him , his jaw clenched tightly . All around him , the people of his land stood clamoring for their lives , no longer clinging onto the hope that this would be a test of their own success . Each step brought a heavy thud , and the weight of it 's own weight on the back of the man 's head carried him back into the darkness of the Great Hall .   The last few brave souls who looked up at the Dark Lord stepped aside to pray , and the words that followed broke the silence that was the hall .   `` Bring forth the Dark Lord of the Plains . This time , for a single battle , we shall save the kingdom from the Dark Lord himself ! ''   The crowd cheered , and all the heroes around them rejoiced . They were prepared .   Everyone in the hall was a nervous mess ; two young men in shining silver armor were lying down to rest . Neither of them were awake yet , so they were all wondering what they would do now .   The Dark Lord of the Plains rose slowly and began walking briskly down the hallway . He stopped at a door to the door , and hesitated .   `` Welcome back , Master of the Plains . ''   The Dark Lord of the Plains came into the room , and sat on a chair opposite of them . His face was grim , and his hands were shaking ; he was feeling restless , and his nails were blistered , and his hair was short and greasy . He spoke quietly , through gritted teeth .   `` You may enter the room , and I will see that you 'll be well prepared for what has happened ahead of you . ''   There were whispers in the room . Some of them whispered , but the Dark Lord of the Plains heard them all . He stood , and crossed his legs .   `` Allow me to explain , then , '' he began , `` You have chosen the path you have chosen , but yet you chose the wrong path . You chose a path that only you could . You chose to lead a life of struggle , misery , and poverty . You chose to serve and protect and serve for the people of this land . You chose to be a tyrant , a tyrant that would never leave the land .   You chose the path you had chosen so long ago . You chose the path that only one man could be saved , not the Dark Lord himself . All of your lives have been spent dedicated to protecting your country and your people . ''   Just inside of the room , the Dark Lord of the Plains rose up , and sat down on the throne above him . He waved his hand over the room , and the room fell silent once more .   The Dark Lord of the Plains knelt down , and placed his hands on his hips .   `` You have chosen to save the country of this land . Do you understand , boy ? ''   `` ... yes , '' the boy said .   The Lord of the Plains stood and walked to the door , and strode out .   The Dark Lord of the Plains sighed . He knew what he was going to do now .   -- -   Thanks for reading !

The first thing I noticed was the cold , almost tangible difference in the air . Instead of the air , I was not cold . I was not cold . I was not dead .   `` Your name is Steven , how can you be dead ? '' a voice asked .   I jerked my head back in shock , and realized that I was no longer standing in a hospital room , but in an old , wooden box . Inside it , nothing but a pile of old clothes , and a cardboard box filled with old clothes and a small , yet familiar looking box . I felt my forehead begin to sweat , and my eyelids began to droop .   `` What ? ''   `` Your age . '' the box said .   I looked around , to see that everything was in disarray . The walls were dust , but the floor was mostly barefoot , save for a single sheet of cement on the ground with a few feet of dirt to it .   `` What 's going on here ? '' I asked .   `` Well , you 're not dead . '' the box answered . `` You were once a human , but no longer are you . ''   `` What ? ! '' I shouted .   `` You were once a man , but you now are a man . ''   I jumped up , and ran towards the box . As I ran , I became aware of it 's presence . It had a small window , a large , black door , a small , metal door , and a small metal door . I reached it , and pulled it open .   Inside was a man . He was on his knees in front of his computer . He was typing away furiously . I saw that his fingers were holding together , and his eyes were glazed over . I looked at him , and noticed that his face was empty .   `` You 're a human . '' the box stated , and I understood that he was speaking to another man .   `` No , I 'm not . '' I replied .   `` I 'm not your son . '' the box answered again .   A few minutes later , I was kneeling in the middle of an intersection on my way home from school . I was looking at the sky in front of me , and was wondering if my son 's name was Steven .   `` Steven , '' I said .   `` He ? '' the box asked .   `` Yes ? '' I asked .   `` How am I going to explain this to you ? ''   `` You know , you really do n't know what to do . ''   `` I did n't want you to die . '' I said .   `` I have friends out there who will do anything to help me go out . ''   `` I 'm sorry , but I have to go , because I have to live my life out here . ''   `` But you know that your son is a man . He 's going to be an adult . ''   `` What you want me to do ... '' I said .   `` No , no , no , no , no , no , no . I 'm sorry , but I ca n't go anymore . I have to live my life out here . '' the box said .   `` What 's going on here ? '' I asked .   `` It 's too late to change , Steven . ''the box answered .   `` I 'm going to go back to the world . You can see it . ''   `` What ? ! '' I yelled .   `` Steven , '' the box said .   `` What is going on here ? You ca n't go back to Earth , Steven . ''   `` Please , take me back to the world . ''   `` Please , take me back to the world . ''   `` Steven , please , take me back to the world . We came back to this world because you are a man . ''   `` What are you saying ? ''   `` Steven , please , I 've waited a thousand years for this . ''   `` Come out of here , Steven . ''   `` DO N'T ! '' I yelled .   `` There 's a good chance you 'll go back to the world . There is a good chance you 'll see it , Steven . ''   `` You do n't have to go
`` Do n't you ever think about the Great Claws ? ''   He lifted his head up into the sky . `` It 's actually quite impressive for a giant . ''   `` I ca n't believe that ! One big toad would be too big for a man . ''   `` No , I mean ... you 're a giants , you see . ''   `` No , it 's actually quite impressive , you know . ''   `` I think ... I think we should be sure that we are not going to be able to lose this war against the great clansman in hopes that we can win this time . ''   `` We * are* not ! I do n't see why we should lose ! The Great Claws have been around since the beginning of time , and there have only been two hundred years of war between us ! This war must be over ! ''   `` No , not at all . ''   The three of them sat on the edge of the balcony of The castle , watching the sky . Looking out across the road , a lone white rabbit flew past . His long white fur shimmered brightly in the moonlight .   `` That 's a great look . '' He said weakly . `` I do n't see where that is going . ''   `` I will have it , sir . ''   `` Ok then , you 're done . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` I have to say , I was starting to think that I might just have to go back and put in the effort to put the effort again . ''   `` Are you sure that I did n't want to do this ? ''   The young man nodded slowly . `` The Great Claws are clearly out there somewhere . ''   `` Then I should have brought the great orc we 've fought so many times , too ! ''   `` Well , I 'm sure it is because it is . '' The man said as he pulled out his sword . `` You do have a point . ''   `` Why ! '' The young man said as he held the large sword out . `` What do you mean ? ''   `` You just said ... I ... think that this might be it . ''   `` But ... but ... ''   `` I ... think it is . ''   `` I ... '' The young man interrupted after a few moments . `` I think ... I 've gone insane . ''   `` No , no , I mean , you know , that does n't sound too crazy . ''   `` But ... '' The young man paused , `` You do n't know what 's in the world anymore . ''   The man nodded . `` I suppose ... like , what are you talking about ? ''   `` Now that I think about it , maybe there are a few things I have n't realized in a while . ''   `` Are you sure that the Great Claws are here ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Yes , yes , I know ! Can these be considered great for a giant ? ''   The man nodded slowly again . `` Oh , yes , I have no idea . ''   `` Then why did we do it ? ''   `` Because that 's the question ! The Great Claws are coming to take us away from the Great clansman ! ''   He held out his hand . `` I ... ''   `` There 's nothing to say about the Great Claws now . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` I ca n't believe that ! '' The young man said as he walked towards the large oak tree that surrounded him .   `` Well ... it 's certainly not about the Claws , though . '' The young man said as he walked towards the oak tree .   `` There is nothing to say now . '' The young woman said as she leaned over to grab the large oak .   `` Sorry , I could n't help but think about them . '' The man said as he looked into her
It was like the first time he saw her . Pale , flabby , pale skin , yet blue . She was no person to anyone , no matter what direction he looked . He could feel her every moving , every movement , even if her skin had something to gain from it .   That was two months ago . The people in the village had all gathered around the village square looking for the day to celebrate . They had thought it was impossible to have any celebrated in the entire time it had been since he last saw her .   They had started getting nervous and desperate , but the celebration would not stop . Their only hope was they could finally be able to finally see her . Every night for the past three months they would go to the square and meet her . It was n't until today , two days into their third day of their annual celebration that they had met .   His heart sank . He sat and waited for her to return .   After what seemed like eternity he finally came to the realisation that he did not have to wait long enough . However , he was the only one who could actually see her . He was finally the one able to see her . He could hear her breathing in the air as she continued to walk into town .   He looked at her with sad eyes and smiled , `` I would miss you '' .   But then , a chill crept up in his chest as he heard her footsteps approaching him .
'Oh man , I just need to keep writing this before I die , ' said the fat guy .   'Well , let me just ... '  'No ! It 's not that I do n't like this , ' the fat guy said . The fat guy was trying to prove to the fat guy for it was a funny joke . He was getting used to it , but the fat guy was n't going to pass up . He was only trying to prove to the fat guy that it was funny .   'OK , OK , but I think it 's time you go back to work ! ' the fat guy told the fat guy .   'What ? I 've forgotten all about you , ' the fat guy said . He was starting to get annoyed , as he thought about all the stories of different people . It was only seconds before he realized his own life was going to be in trouble .   'Alright , alright , ' the fat guy said , ' Let 's go home . Love you . '
It ’ s the fourth time this month , and my heart is racing . I looked down at the blackened pavement that surrounds me , before turning around to face the city sprawled out before me . It ’ s the fourth time this month , and the streets are still soaked with rain , as do I. The roof of the roof slides down and the wind picks up . It ’ s the fourth time this month , and I can ’ t take it anymore . I call the police , and there ’ s no answer . I call the authorities , and there ’ s no answer . I ’ m afraid to jump .   The moonlight shines through the cracked window , illuminating the window with a gentle , gentle glow . I slowly pull the covers off my body . I ’ m sweating profusely . The blood rushes down my face , and I can hear a faint , female voice , repeating the words . “ It ’ s the fifth time this month , ” she repeats again , “ It ’ s the fifth time this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the fifth time this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the fifth time this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the sixth time this month , ” she repeated , “ The sixth time this month , '' she repeated , “ It ’ s the seventh time this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the seventh time this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the seventh time this month. ”   I look around , hoping to find shelter . Nothing in the way of shelter , and I look at the ceiling , hoping to find shelter within the confines of my roof . I stare at the glass . The ceiling has now fallen out . I can see the outline of a ceiling , just below the surface . I ’ ve seen it before , but never seen it . I look again , hoping I can find any sign of anything that might have changed , anything that might be making this moment any different .   “ What the fuck , what the fuck , ” I yell at myself , and fall down onto the floor , gasping for air with every breath . The only sound I can hear is the soft , soothing echo of the wind , as it blows , sending chills down my back . I try to get up , but feel like I ’ m stuck in a chair , somehow . I try to stand up again , but I ’ m feeling weak . I don ’ t even have the strength to lift the covers off my body . I sit up , and my vision is beginning to go dark . I wake up in a cold sweat on my back , and I look around . The moonlight shines through the cracked window , illuminating me with a gentle , gentle , female voice , repeating the words .   “ It ’ s the seventh time this month , ” she repeats , “ It ’ s the eighth time this month , ” she repeats , “ It ’ s the ninth time this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the tenth time this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the sixth fucking month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the ninth fucking month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the tenth fucking month this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the eleventh fucking month this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s the eleventh fucking month this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s ... it ’ s the eleventh fucking month this month , ” she repeated , “ It ’ s ... it ’ s ... it ’ s ... it ’ s ... it ’ s ... it ’ s ... it ’ s ... it ’ s ... ” she repeating , “ it ’ s ... it 's it 's ... it ’ s ... it ’ S ... it 's… it 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it ’ s ... it ’ s… it ’ s ... it ’ s ... ”   The last thing I remember before I woke up was the distant smell of sulfur and metal . I stared at the large steel door that I had come to accept that there would never be another home , nor another real home . I fell to my knees and prayed to God that I could find somebody else .   I looked around , praying that I could find someone else out there , anyone who could take me home . I was disappointed , for sure
Tommy sat on the armchair of his rocking chair , his hair , his blue eyes , his thin beard in full force . His chin relaxed , his perfect teeth locked on the surface of the small wooden desk . His hands sat on the desk he had sat in recently , one hand dangling around his keyboard . It was a simple chair , one that had served his purpose in the beginning . Its frame was sturdy , and did n't break apart . Its design was simple , but well maintained . The top corner table was lined with neatly spread folding sheets , and there were a few large wooden box pieces in each of the boxes . However , the bottom floor was lined with some sort of ornate lettering . It reads ,  `` I am Timmy ! ''  Tommy blinked and rubbed his eyes , he had never been a fan of reading . He wanted to be a professional , but now , he had no idea what to do . He heard footsteps coming from inside the room .  The footsteps approached , and as Tommy made his way down the hallway , he noticed that the house was now pitch black with only the barest of light coming from the basement out front . He pushed open the small closet , and opened with a heavy shove that sent shivers down his spine . As he neared the staircase , he noticed as he went from foot to foot , a door swung open , and a man stood there . He wore a tattered , dark looking suit .  `` How is Timmy ? '' Tommy said to the man , trying to keep his voice low .  `` I am Timmy , son of the big house owner , '' said the man , his blue eyes looking around .  `` Oh mom , '' said Tommy , `` I 'm so sorry ! ''  `` Who are you ? '' asked the man , his tone turning to concern .  `` My name is Mikey , I was hired by Tommy to kill an abusive father for 3 years ! With your sister 's advice , I will do anything for you . ''   Tommy was confused , as he never heard her say anything , he just took a deep breath and said , `` Well , I 'm sorry , I ca n't do that , I ca n't go anywhere , and I want to punish you . ''   Mikey gave Mikey a very confused look , `` Are you sure you want to go somewhere ? ''  Mikey shrugged impatiently .  `` What is going on ? Do you want to go to hell ? '' asked Tommy , his shoulders slumped down .  `` Will you ever forgive me ? ''   `` Absolutely , son . '' 
I remember being in the military and was told that I 'd be an engineer , but not so much that I could be a scientist and yet , here I am , in the same room . This space is barren , but I can see the moon , clear as day , stretching into the distance as if it were a fog . There are trees , with branches of oak that I can never quite see , but it 's hard to see because they 're like trees in the sky .   I stare blankly at my computer , then at my watch . I reach over to pick it up , and my mind wanders to the last thing that I remember before I die . I remember my dad kissing me on the forehead , my mother pushing me through the door , and my father kissing me again , and soon , one after the other .   I come back to my computer , and a new thing begins to play . It 's very large , and all the branches are growing too tall . Even the trees look different ...   My eyes widen . I look down at my hands . They 're getting bigger . I look down at my feet . They 're getting more elaborate , and they are growing too tall . I look up at them , and then I notice the moon . It 's a different moon , but it 's in a different place . When I look up at it , I notice it has a dome of beautiful stars around it . And there 's a great big ring in the center of the dome that extends forever .   These stars are the stars that I knew were going to be my wife and my kids , and I knew that if I let them go , they would become my wife and my kids , and they would be the children of my family .   I realize that I was never meant to live forever . I was never meant to have my own , and I would never have children . I will never have kids .
It had been so long since he 'd been sober .   He 'd been hiding in the shadow of his room , keeping up with his plans , until he did n't dare move from the shadows of the dark .   He knew he could n't escape this simple task .   He 'd killed his nemesis .   He knew he had to stop him .   Once his plan was complete , he 'd set about his plan .   *That 's why I 'm here . *   *I 'm ready . *   He brought his evil breath upon the small table as I approached , and smiled .   `` Master , you ... you have failed me . '' He said , his voice hoarse and cracked .   `` Thank you . '' I said , `` I 've failed you as well . ''   He nodded , and sat back , leaning forward to take in his surroundings . He was dressed in black , with a yellow cape hanging low over the shoulders . His face was covered in a mask . His eyes were a blood red at night , and his hair was a tangled mess .   He was dressed with a white shirt with purple stripes across the collar .   `` So , now that you 've defeated me , I 've finally reached my goal . '' He said , his voice soft and slightly softer at times , almost a whisper .   `` Yes . '' I replied .   He extended both eyebrows .   `` I think you know exactly what I 've done . '' He said , slowly getting his grip on his clipboard .   I raised an eyebrow .   `` What ? '' I said , `` No . You ... you ca n't tell me what I 've done . ''   `` Of course I can , '' he said , `` but you 've got to . ''   `` Oh . Well ... I 'd guess that 's not what I want you to know either , then , is it ? ''   He puffed out a small puff , and his eyes looked at me .   `` What ? '' I asked , my voice cracking .   He looked up at me , and then back at his clipboard . `` So , you can tell me what I 've done ? How ? ''   I sighed deeply , considering what I had just done .   `` I 've tried everything , '' I said , `` but ... you 've tried all the things I 've done . ''   `` Am I really ? '' he asked , his eyebrows still rising .   `` Yes . Not exactly , '' I replied .   `` But ... '' he said .   He looked at me , his teeth still slightly level with mine . He looked me up and down , his eyes still locked on mine . He sniffled , and a tear rolled down the corner of his eye .   `` I suppose I 'm finally done , Master . ''   I rose from my chair , and entered the small lounge , where I kept my things .   I began to pour some stuff into my cup , and sat down . The hot liquid clumsily splattered onto the old chair .   `` Hello , '' I said .   `` Hello Mr. Bond , '' the young man said .   `` Is this an invitation ? '' I asked , my heart still racing .   `` Of course , but do n't you all get to see my work ? '' He said , `` I never really wanted to . ''   `` That 's what you 're here for , Mr. Bond . ''   `` Yes . '' I said , `` but do n't you all get to see my works ? I have made mistakes , that I could n't undo . ''   `` And what are you going to do ? '' he repeated , his voice still almost pleading .   `` I 'll go with you to your car , '' I said , `` and we 'll go out for dinner . ''   `` What ? '' he tried to ask , `` That does n't sound like an invitation . ''   `` No . '' I replied , `` it sounds like a plan . ''   `` No . ''   `` No . What ? ''   `` I 'll go with you to your car , and we 'll go out for dinner .
In a distant universe , there once was such a spark . The spark that brought everything together . The spark that brought harmony to other universes .   I created the first humanoid life form . The first species that I had created .   They called me Adam . I called them humans .   I saw that they needed me now . They needed me to help them . They needed me to keep them going until the end . I was gone . I was powerless .   No more human kind could exist in this universe . I was replaced with a new one . The last human made to exist .   Humans . A new breed and a new species .   I am alone .   I turn off the electricity .   I am dying .
`` I can do it . ''   The familiar sounds of the waves crashing against the shore , the leaves slowly drifting towards the ground , the fog slowly creeping back onto the shore . To the left , the darkness was illuminated with bright green lights . From behind , the sound of the boat drifted away , making it sound as though it had been hit by a stray wave .   `` It 's okay . ''   Suddenly , a bright light came from the waves and cut the fog off . The people in front of me looked across , just in time to see the man lying still on the ground , eyes wide with surprise .   `` How long have you been gone ? ''   The man slowly rolled onto the rough sand , his hair barely moving . The sun was falling behind him , and he could barely see . Without saying a word , he managed to drag himself upright and grab the knife .   `` I know . ''   He stood up and looked toward the shore , looking for somewhere to hide his face .   `` Alright . Wait , what does that mean ? ''   He turned to the man in front of him , holding out a finger . The man took it , and the light disappeared .   `` Give it back , '' the man in front of him said , turning back toward the waves .
*So I did n't remember the pain , the screams , the gunfire . *   No , that 's a lie . I remember those times . Those times while we could barely stand the sight of a man dying . The screams the ones we did n't see coming . Those times when we wished we could make it .   But for the first time in my childhood , I could n't bear the sight of that man . I remember the faces of those people , the faces of my ancestors .   *I wish I could be more prepared . *   We built a village out of ashes . We built a village of ashes . We built a village of ashes . We built a village of ashes . We built a * village of ashes . *   But I 'd know better . I know what my parents did when they took me away . I 'd know what my mother said on the night I was born , how her words echoed through the halls for generations over the last few years .   *I wish I could be at peace . *   I could n't take the pain , the screams , the gunfire . I remember those times . Those * times when we wished we could make it .   I know what my parents did when they took me away . I know that my children are very young . I know that I ca n't take the pain , the screams , the gunfire .   But I ca n't bear the sight of that man , the faces . I remember the faces of my ancestors . I remember the faces of my ancestors .   *I wish I could be more prepared . *   *I wish I could be a better father . *   *I wish I could be less responsible . *
Every night , if I 'm feeling the way I am now , I can see where I am . I know this because my friends had put me on a long and lonely hike , for example . The forest was sparse aside from the occasional deer or deer , most deer still left alone in trees . After the trail we passed it was quiet , with only the occasional wolf or rabbit left . My friends had even given me some food to keep me company , giving me plenty of air to catch my breath and eat . While I was enjoying those meals , they had told me to relax . The sun was shining , and the forest was almost as quiet now . I always wanted to go for walks instead of hiking with my friends . I wanted to go for the first time in years . I knew I would not be coming back until my friends gave up , but I knew I would not be coming back until there was nothing left to live for .
When I first saw my future , I did n't know how I had gotten in so far . The first reaction : It had been so easy , living a life I made up of my experiences . I had been homeless all my life , and I was n't going to get much sleep . No , that seemed like a good thing .   I thought it was weird that I could start over , make things better , or change things that I did n't know about myself ? I wanted to go back to the beginning , try back to the beginning as a person , but that seemed impossible . I knew it would n't work like that if I never wanted to be .   I had to think about it carefully , for most people , and try to work with them . I tried to get myself a job , to keep in touch with their interests , to get them to be interested in me , to get myself to be good with something . But to do that , to find out if someone else was worth it , I had to experience things . It was like living every day in a new life , making every change , every day .   I went back in time . And as I saw my future , I realized that I had already lived through it , and I had n't missed anything . I had missed her , she and I , I had talked about it all and I had been happy for years .   I was happy . We had n't spoken in years . I had gotten old , and had n't aged well in anyone but my own memories . I was afraid to not talk about it much longer .   I was afraid that I would n't be able to find out what was going on my future self . And I was scared that I would n't be able to live it out , knowing that what I had done would mean I would n't be able to change anything .   So , I went through times like those . I went through life together , we went to college together . I had been homeless all my life . But I was n't ready for it .   And then as I saw my future selves , I realized that it was never going to work like that . I had changed everything . I did n't know anymore , I did n't know what would happen . I just wanted to be happy and not be stuck in this life . This life , the ones that I had had lived in before , the ones that I had spent the last few years in ... I just wanted to be with them .   I thought it was weird that I could start over , and make things perfect , or change things that I did n't know about myself . But whenever I felt like changing things , I could see myself again , and not be stuck in this life .   So , I began to think about it carefully , for most people , and try to get myself good with something . But to get myself to be good with something , I knew that I had already lived through it , and I had n't missed anything . I had n't missed anything .   So I decided to make things better . I lived in a different world . I lived in a different town , with different people , with different people , with a different story about myself , and a different face . I lived in a different town , with different people , with different perspectives , and a different person . I lived in a different town , with different faces and different interests .   So I decided to make things better . I lived in a different town , in a different place , with different people , and a different face . I lived in a different town , in a different town , and with different people , and a different face . So , I started to think about it carefully , for some people , and try to work with them . But to work with them , I knew that I had already lived through it , and I had n't missed anything .   So , I started to think about it slowly , and tried to make things better . I ran out of options . I started to think about it slowly , and tried to make things better .   I stood up , and walked out straight to her house . She was beautiful . I always knew it was going to be a big day , and her day was coming . And I just wanted to be with her .   As I walked out to her door , I knew that I was going to run out early for work this night , and to find out what was going on my future self .   I walked out of my house , and into the driveway . I saw her sleeping in the covers . I saw myself sleeping with her , and she was smiling and playing with her toys . I saw myself opening
`` What the fuck , '' I scream , clutching the cookie jar in my hand .   `` You 'll answer me ! '' the radio crackles . A muffled squeal echoes through the ship .   `` Hello ? '' I say , as the door begins to close .   As if in response , the ship begins to slide in towards me .   `` You 'll answer me ! '' it repeats .   `` So what the fuck , '' I say , holding the cookies cookie jar tight .   `` You 're going to answer me ! '' the radio crackles .   `` Really ?

I awoke , and found myself in an unfamiliar room . I could n't say what had happened , but I heard nothing . I panicked for a second , before picking myself up and running .   When I arrived , the room was not the same as my apartment . There were no windows , only a small set of folding chair , which was covered in a layer of dust on it . I ran towards the chair , where I would sit until I was dizzy , and picked the chair up . I looked around the room , mostly to see what was going on .   The room was not my apartment .   I looked to the left , and saw them .   They were young , and grey , but also very bright . They wore nothing but a pair of thick grey shoes , which matched their green eyes at the same time . They wore clothes that would usually make me feel happy , but were completely black . He walked up to me , and gestured for me to sit .   He sat in silence .   `` So ... '' I started .   `` You could tell us what 's happening . The humans do n't like it . They want us to be ready for it . We want them to know how much we love them . ''   I gulped , and the words seemed rather choked out . I was sure the words continued .   `` Our children 's bodies are n't meant to love each other . Just hope for the best . ''   `` Thank you . '' I replied .   He sat again in silence .   `` What are you going to do ? '' I asked .   He smiled , and gestured for me to sit .   `` I 'm going to need you to tell us ... '' he began .   I did the same as he said , but I could n't see anything inside of me . I got up and looked at him in disbelief , but could n't hear anything else on the other side .   He repeated this in front of me for seconds , and then turned away .   He stood in the corner , his arms crossed . He placed a hand on my shoulder , and said , `` Go away . ''   The words left my mouth , in a panicked rush at what must have been the wrong thing to say .   He placed his hand on my shoulder again , and said , `` Go . ''   The lights outside my room went bright . I heard a sound , too , and then a voice said , `` It 's OK , Thomas . We will be with you soon . ''   The man stood up , and walked away .   I felt numb , as if waking from a deep sleep . I looked down at my hand .   I felt myself slipping away . Memories flood my mind , and then disappear .   One memory felt so familiar . It was of my mother , carrying me into the bathroom , and that 's when I finally saw her . She was n't there , but the room was . It was in a room full of people , all wearing white clothing , and smiling . They all looked so happy , even though I could n't see that .   They did n't have to leave .   I was still hungry .   I looked up at them , and smiled .   `` You 're still alive . ''
The sun was shining through the smokey , red-stained sky , making the air colder than usual . There were a few of us left . We were going to make it .   All the brothers and sisters who came through the gate were crying like mad , and my brothers and sisters were crying like we were all out there against another group of rebels . We were marching toward victory , but there was no one besides us . The rebels and their militia stood in line , yelling at us , but we just kept marching .   We knew we were going to lose . We were taking my brother ...   To the front , the rebel commander stood at the edge of the line so he could n't see us . He was terrified , and it was hard to imagine how long the rebels had been fighting .   `` Commander , '' I said , speaking quietly into my microphone . `` It is time . You have survived . ''   `` Yes , '' he said , lowering his voice . He could n't tell how many times in his life , he would have screamed of joy at the death of his brothers and sisters , or how many times he would have tried to get help by telling what he was told . But he did n't listen .   The explosion sent shaking men and women to the ground , shattering their fragile bones and lungs . They looked at the enemy commander , then around me . The soldiers around me were screaming , and there was no answer .   I would n't hear the sound of my brothers and sisters getting pulled back from their enemies , but I would hear their screams getting a moment later .   `` Commander , '' I said quietly . `` Listen to me . I need you to calm down , please . ''   My voice was choked and I choked back tears . I knew this was a chance , but the tears had already begun to flow .   `` Okay , Commander , I 'm sorry , but I have to tell them what had happened . Please . ''   A scream came through me and I felt my neck and my lungs burn . I tried not to gag , but fear gripped me as I tried to control my breathing . I tried to scream , but I could n't .   The rebels and militia were in front of me , and the rebels and militia were crouched over me . There were people screaming and fighting among themselves . Everyone was terrified , but I could n't control my breath .   I kept trying to control my breathing .   The rebels and militia were in front of me now , but they were n't behind me and I was n't behind them . I heard people yelling at either of them . I could feel the red-stained sky behind me , but I could n't feel my heart beating .   The rebels had taken every advantage of the situation , and people were screaming at the same time . I heard the explosions as the Rebels and militia were fighting , but I did n't listen and neither did them . I heard the screams as they fell to their knees , and I could n't hear them .   Even with my breathing , I had not heard a scream . The fear was starting to build , and I could feel my heart pounding . My breaths became heavy , and my arms were beginning to shake .   The rebels and militia were in front of me now , but their screams were getting louder now and louder . I tried to scream , but I could n't . My throat burned and I had n't managed to find any words .   I could barely hear them . Someone screamed , but I could n't hear any words .   The rebels and militia were in front of me now , but they were n't behind me anymore , and I could n't hear them . They were talking to themselves . I tried to shout , but no sound came out .   There was a crackle in the crater , and a thunderous crash echoed through the darkness . I tried to scream , but everything was muffled . I was alone .   I heard my brother 's voice crack in my head , but I could n't .      
I woke up with a start and the sun was shining . I rubbed my eyes shut and looked around me . There was one guy in the living room . I walked over to him and said , `` Hey , dude . How are you feeling ? '' And he did . I looked around for the kitchen to figure out where I was . I looked around and saw that the floor was bare but not a single inch of where I was . I checked my pockets and pockets to make sure everything was still in order .   It was n't . There was nothing . I should have noticed . I went back to putting out my cereal .   I went back to my bedroom and saw that I was alone . I walked to my bed and still no one was there . I went to my closet and grabbed my clothes and stuff . I put out my clothes and went to the bathroom . I went to a sink and sat down . I looked at my feet and found I was wearing jeans , a shirt , and a purple tank top . I looked at my legs and found I had brown hair . I looked at my chest . I looked at my face . I looked at my head . I looked at my hands . I looked at the sky and decided to take a few steps back . I looked at the ground . I looked at the grass . I looked at the trees . I looked at the trees . I looked at the sunlight . I looked at myself and said , `` Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , huh '' . The sky was orange .
My wife and I had a long day at work . First we had to take a long look at the calendar . It was the same year , as always . We had spent several hours trying to figure out how to set it to the year 2201 .   `` What was that ? '' my wife replied . As we sat down in the car , the man on the radio said , `` It 's the year 2201 , we 're going to meet again out at our place ... ''   I stared at him confused , `` what 's wrong ? That 's the year 2014 . It was the year 2020- ''   `` Shut up ! '' I interrupted .   `` You crazy son of a bitch ! '' yelled a young , blonde haired man in a dark coat .   `` And you 're a lizard ! '' I yelled .   A large lizard began spewing out a large , oily black liquid .   `` It 's going to happen , it needs to be done ! '' I yelled , as my wife shrieked . I then grabbed my son 's hand and slammed the door . `` God damn it ! '' I yelled .   edit : wrote a couple words , tried to do stuff with it . Oops .
`` Uh ... hi.. I 'm Tom . ''   `` Hi Tom , how are you doing today ? ''   `` Great . I 'm just doing a sweep of the school today . I 'm pretty sure the teachers are doing okay . ''   `` Wow . So I 'm not doing that too well , or that you have to come out in the middle of the night to talk to more people ? ''   `` I wan na know what you think . ''   `` Are you sure ? ''   `` Yeah . It 's for my family to see me . ''   `` Ok. Thanks . ''   `` Have a nice night Tom , come back to school later . ''   As , Tom left the store and wandered west and into the woods . He heard the creek behind him , but did n't turn around .   He woke up early .   `` Holy shit ... wha-what is happening ? What 's going on ? ''   `` Mr. Pemberton , your son has been brought into the school to test for DNA . ''   `` What do you mean 'test for DNA ' ? ''   `` It 's in the lab , our son will be adopted immediately . Would you like to share your results ? ''   `` What the hell is going on ? ''   `` Apparently this is n't the first time someone has brought in a child , and that they have n't had any of it tested yet . But ... Mr. Pemberton , is he okay ? ''   `` Yeah . I 'm just fine . Why do you ask ? ''   `` Mr. Pemberton , you are being monitored by the Institute of Bodies for genetic testing . You have been deemed to be the most ethical ethical and ethical person in the world . Do you understand ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` You have a choice Tom , do you want to share your results ? ''   `` Uh ... ''   `` Mr. Pemberton , your Son is adopted immediately . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` Why do you know ? ''   `` Because he 's really healthy . ''   `` So I told you that your son wo n't be adopted . I 'm not sure if that will ever make sense . ''   `` Do n't worry Mr. Pemberton , we 're happy . ''   `` So I should be happy ? ''   `` Uh ... no . ''   `` Okay , if you would like to share your results , let me try to talk to your parents . ''   `` Excuse me ? I 'm still having trouble explaining what 's going on . ''   `` We will be at your house as soon as you 're home . ''   `` Do n't worry , I 'll be fine . Thanks . ''   `` Okay Mrs. Pemberton , I 'll see you in a few hours . ''   The house was a mess , but Tom was home feeling fine .   `` Mr. Pemberton , are you alright ? ''   `` I 'm fine . ''   `` Are you Mr. Pemberton ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Good . Good . ''   `` Do n't worry about Mr. Pemberton , I 'll see you there . ''   `` Will you be at my house again ? ''   `` Um , no . ''   `` Good . Bye , Mr. Pemberton . ''   `` Bye , Tom . ''           
Cue his dead brother , Tony , down on the floor . Tony could have killed his brother . He hoped for a return of the inheritance , but Tony held on tight to the idea of leaving his family . His poor , poor cousin had no other family to pick on , and had no money to spare . Tony had no time to live . He had to watch his brother suffer through his own family .   So Tony took a deep breath , took one last look at his brother , and began to cry . Tony had never seen so much pain in his brother 's life . It was beyond his control , and not the first time either . Tony had watched as his brothers father died after three years of wealth , and while Tony was not able to afford immediate care , he had his brother to cry for him . Tony had no family , but he had to watch him suffer as more and more people starved to death for more money and more power . Tony had to watch his brother suffer like he never had before .   --   The land-locked land-locked land-locked land-LOCK door creaked open , revealing a sprawling spire with a single staircase in the middle . A huge , imposing mansion was arranged so high up the stairs that it seemed to swallow entire cities whole . Tony would have to see his brother suffer with such intensity . In the middle of each spire lay a large dining room . Across the room lay two chairs with a large circular table and a large large wooden table . The table , along with an overturned lamp sat upon it . The room itself looked like it should have been made of silver , but the entire room was covered in various metal cubes that looked like they were chipped , and most importantly , everywhere . One of the cubes was covered in wires and tubes , and the other was held out in front of him . A metal wire came from a small device on the table , and it powered down the other one . The figure in the middle of the room , if he could call it that stepped into the room , stepped forward into the room , and placed his hands upon his sides . Tony could not move . He could not breathe . He could not see . He could not breathe . He could not feel or smell .   He began to look around , but found that he was alone . His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the footsteps . The footsteps became louder and louder , until it became apparent that everyone had stopped walking . Tony stood up , took one last look around , and began to run .   --   The footsteps stopped at the bottom of the staircase . Tony could see the roof of the mansion from underneath , but the stairs itself was not that large as the rest . They were still there . The footsteps continued towards the top of the stairs as they approached the top of the tallest building in the world . Tony walked down the hallway with no warning .
Truly the best father .   The one who had raised me to be great . The one who had helped me grow up .   I loved Him . I loved him . He loved me as I fell into darkness .   He loved me when I was young .   He loved me when I was a toddler .   He loved me when I was a man , that was until I was seven .   He loved me when I was nine . He loved me when I was twenty .   He loved me when I was twenty-nine . He loved me when I was thirty-nine .   He loved me when I was twenty-eight . He loved me when I was twenty-five .   He loved me when I was forty-eight . He loved me when I was twenty-five , when I was twenty-seven..   He loved me when I was forty-five . He loved me while I was thirty-six..   He loved me whenever I was thirty-nine..   He loved me when I was twenty-nine . He loved me when I was thirty-nine .   He loved me when I was thirty-two..   He loved me when I was sixty-three..   He loved me and I loved him .
I looked around me frantically as I looked down my wrist . 50 years . 50 years is hard to count . How long ? 50 years ? I could n't see anything except for the bright lights and the flashing lights . It was getting dark . I would have to sleep . It was always dark , but it always made me feel warm . I curled my legs up to my chest and stared at the ceiling , watching the distant stars . As I opened my eyes I heard a strange silence . I opened my eyes slowly to see men in black suits staring their chests up and down , seeming to look down at me . I pushed my way to them , but noticed something . It was n't my wrist . I looked around , but could n't see much in front of me . It was almost pitch black . I tried to move , but I could n't . The air felt so thick . I tried to scream , but I could n't . I screamed at them to get away from me , to be quiet . The men continued their march , and the lights started flashing again . I could n't hear anything . I closed my eyes tight and tried to go back to sleep . My mind was racing . I tried to remember what I had yesterday . Everything began to blur , and I could n't hold steady . Finally , I opened my eyes and saw the man in the black suit , holding my hand . He was holding a gun . He did n't have a gun . He had a pistol . He had the pistol in her hand . He was holding another person . I looked at the gun with confusion . I closed my eyes again . The man in the black suit was holding another person . The man in the black suit was holding the gun . More people jumped out of behind him and ran . The screams from the men stopped . The man in the black suit was staring at the sky and sighed . The man in the black suit was holding a gun . The man in the black suit was holding his own gun . The man in the black suit was holding a gun . The man in the black suit was holding a gun . The man in the black suit was holding another person . The man in the black suit was holding the white gun . The man in the black suit was holding his own gun .   *Thanks for reading !

The sound of crashing bones echoed along the barren corridor , and I found myself standing in the middle of a frozen wasteland , surrounded by three corpses .   A voice whispered as she turned around , looking at the faces of my group of heroes .   `` You 're a fool . '' The voice hissed .   I slowly , with an effort to keep from laughing , turned to face my nemesis .   `` I 'm going to kill you , and you 're done . ''   *****   /r/dori_tales

I can hear them . They are sitting on top of me , in a hoodie , black cloak . The very same man I 've seen every day at work and at work . They are looking at me , and they are smiling . They are also looking at me with that same expression that a lover usually gives when he takes a long breath .   I ca n't be certain what they are talking about . I do n't have a clue what they are , but I do know that my world is full of them .   `` Are you serious ? '' The man asks me , now staring at me .   I can see them . They are sitting in front of me , on top of me , in a hoodie with a hoodie , black cloak and black cloak underneath .   `` Are you serious ? '' I ask him again , now looking at me with that same expression that a lover usually gives when he takes a long breath .   `` Are you serious ? '' The man answers .   I do n't want to believe what he is saying . I want to believe that this man , that I am his true form .   `` Are you serious ?

`` You are the first . You are the last . You are the last . ''   I threw open my eyes . I was lying in bed , with my mouth open and mouth open , but the light was blinding , so I closed my eyes and relaxed my breathing . I was still in the middle of a long day at work , my boss was telling me I had n't had enough of my new job , but I had to go to work anyway . If I could only get through another day .   My breathing caught in my throat , and after a few seconds of it , I noticed my teeth were stuck in my mouth . I was n't thirsty yet , or hungry , I was just thirsty and did n't have any appetite to eat .   I let out a long sigh , and leaned back in my bed . My teeth felt like they were on fire . I pushed them out , and the fire started to die down . I closed my eyes as I heard the faint sound of footsteps . I closed them again . I was hungry . I felt sick . I shut my eyes and closed my eyes . My teeth felt like they were on fire . I opened my eyes and closed my eyes . I felt sick . I closed my eyes again . My teeth felt like they were on fire . I opened my eyes and closed my eyes . I felt sick . I opened my eyes , and closed my eyes . I was still in the middle of a long day at work , my boss was telling me I had n't had enough of my new job , but I had to go to work anyways .   My breathing caught in my throat , and I was n't thirsty yet , but I was still in the middle of a long day at work , my boss was telling me I had n't had enough of my new job , but I had to go to work anyways . If I could only get through another day .
The man who sat opposite me in the corner of the room , his hands resting on his hips . He was an average middle aged man , but with brown hair . His features were perfectly aligned in that pattern at his sides , with the exception of the square jawline that stretched past his chin .   `` Do you think this is the easiest job you could do , Tony ? '' He asked .   I nodded , holding back my laughter .   `` I do n't know . Maybe eventually you 'll have to do it again . What do you think ? ''   I shook my head . `` Maybe , '' I said slowly , pressing my finger against his lips and feeling the weight of his body against my palm . `` Maybe I will never know . Maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... I mean ... maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... ''   `` Well , '' he started , his voice cutting off . `` There was a scene in the park near your home . ''   He paused , chewing his bottom lip . `` I 'll never know . I never know . ''   I nodded . `` Maybe , maybe ... maybe . Maybe.. maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... ''   `` Okay ! What do you think ? '' He said , grabbing my hand .   I shook my head . `` Maybe , maybe— maybe , maybe , maybe… ''   He took a deep breath , his eyes shining a bright yellow . `` Okay , fine , '' he said , finally lifting up his arm . `` Ok , okay , okay . Let 's go out . ''   -- -- -- -- -   `` I would like to be completely honest . ''   `` I am not . ''   `` You 're a perfect candidate . ''   `` Yes , the only person who 'll ever know . ''   `` Yeah . That 's true , right . ''   `` You know , like , my wife , or my kids , '' I said , leaning forward . `` I did n't put up with her bullshit all day . I thought she would be just a complete dickhead , but she would n't listen to me . ''   `` I did , '' he said , laughing quietly . `` And she did n't have time to listen . ''   `` Yeah , she did . ''   `` She did . She did . And why take so long to pick up on your pathetic little piece of shit from school ? ''   `` Because she said , 'You 're not the best candidate for this job . ' ''   `` Why ? '' said Tony , his eyes shining a bright yellow . `` Because she said , 'You 're a perfect candidate . ' ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` Then why the fuck did you do this ? Why did you do this to me ? ''   `` Because the only person who 'll ever know is me . ''   `` Huh . ''   `` You 're a perfect candidate , '' I said , pulling the trigger .   -- -- -- -- -- --   When I woke up , my eyes still glowing an amber , I was dressed in my suit . I grabbed my phone and answered the call .   `` Hey , '' I said , my voice breaking . `` I got ta go back . ''   `` Yes ? '' Asked my girlfriend , sitting in my armchair .   `` Yes . ''   `` Hey , you 're still *alive* . You used to be a perfect candidate at school . But now , you 're just the average guy who 's all too predictable . And you were n't able to find another job . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` You need to leave now . ''   `` No . You have to leave . ''   `` No . ''   `` No . ''   `` No . ''   `` No . ''   `` No . ''   `` No . No . NO . NO . NO . NO ! ''   `` Sir ? ''   `` Yes ? ''   `` What does he know ? ''   There was a pause . `` No ? ''   `` No . ''   `` No ? ''   `` No . No . No . NO ! ''   `` Sir

`` We 're winning . ''   `` We 're losing . ''   He sat cross legged on the deck of his dingy ship . A look of betrayal was visible across his face . Even though I was there , I knew that he 'd been thinking about this . I saw his wife the next day , and the day after , and the day after that . He would n't have to deal with it here .   `` We lost , '' I said .   He sighed and reached towards his pocket . The pocket where he 'd pocketed his life- savings bill .   `` We ca n't win . ''   I rubbed the back of my hand . His lips were clenched , and then there was silence .   `` No , '' I said .   He laughed and pulled out his wallet . He put his hand on the deck . I gave him a solemn nod .   `` Go , '' I said . `` Go , go . Go , go . Go . Go . Go ! Go ! ''   He nodded . His hand was n't shaking , but still gripped the deck of his dingy ship .   `` Let 's go . ''   I had n't given him a single glance , or a single nod when I walked to that front door . I had n't even come over to say goodbye to my wife , and that day would come .   And now , I stood there on the deck of the dingy ship .   `` We 're winning . ''   I left .   I opened the door and walked into the room . Two men sat in front of a glowing screen . Both had a strange expression on their face .   `` We 're winning . ''
The argument had been going on for like every other night at my parents ' house . That day it was an especially bad one . I 'd even been home early enough to get a better blanket to defend myself . I knew that soon I would have to leave , if only to get back to my apartment . As I was walking into the house I heard footsteps coming from the front door . My heart began to race . What did I get myself into to do ? I opened the door and noticed my mother and father holding hands .   `` Darling , what do you want ? ''   `` We 've been married for twenty-two years and I 'm really worried about you . ''   This was something I really had been waiting for . I had been expecting to see them . They were talking about something big . Someone really big . `` Are you sure ? If you ever want to come home after that , you should come at least once a month . ''   `` I 'll be right here . ''   I could n't wait for them to talk . He was so close . They both had a lot to say , and how long had it been since they had been together . Every single day they had sat around and talked . Just that same routine . Finally they were convinced , but they were too young to be excited .   I made my way back into their room . They were eating their dinner . I could n't even wait for them to start talking . They just sat there , silent . I stepped over to the table . I saw the father , who had started fighting over something , suddenly burst into tears .   `` You know we ca n't have children ! You know that we wo n't have anything on the house to help us with something ! We have to go ! '' He shouted . I covered my mouth and started to sob . After a few minutes , I just nodded . I was back in my room .   I remembered that one night when I thought about how I was just a kid . As I watched them eat , I knew that soon everyone would be having their lives ruined . I had just brought my car to the house . It had been so uneventful . I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I thought I just wanted to watch them all go over again . I closed my eyes and just thought about how bad it was . How much I cared about them . I opened them again , and this time was different . Only they were there . I closed them again , and again , and again . I was back in my room . I could n't believe it . I was scared , horrified , and scared of what I might have to do .   I was running to my mother 's room . I would have to get back to my apartment . I was done with what had just happened . I reached into my pocket and looked for my keys .   I opened the door .
As my burglar entered the house , I saw the front door open and a young woman was running away with a gun .    `` Uh , are you alright ? '' I asked the woman , trying to hold back tears .    `` I-I do n't know , I just kind of just came in a -- ''    `` You need to relax , baby , '' she told me . `` Just chill . Just relax and enjoy yourself . ''    I stared at her blankly . No one seemed to notice her standing there , or at least acknowledge her .    She looked back over her shoulder to see that our burglar , the one who had stolen the woman , had vanished .
`` Alright , '' said Tom , turning the kid off . `` What 's going on ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` You 're going to be spending all day staring at the ceiling . ''   Tom looked at the scar made up of his birthmark , which was growing bigger over the years . His parents were worried that would mean that the baby was getting bigger as the years went by .   `` Fine , '' said Tom , `` maybe it 's some kind of freak accident or something . ''   `` No , I just saw this little girl once . '' Tom grabbed a random object and threw it at the wall . `` Maybe it 's some kind of ... freak accident , by the way . ''   `` Then you did n't see it ! ''   Tom stared at him . He looked back to the house , and then back again to the scar made up of the boy 's birthmark . Tom walked towards the door , but he heard that the door had opened .   `` Hello ? '' said the voice .   `` Hello ? '' Tom started to hear louder , but his voice was all muffled .   `` Hello ? '' It was a female voice . `` Hello ? ''   `` What do you want ? ''   `` Just got back from school , '' said Tom , `` I need you to come with me . ''   `` Uh , I do n't know what you 're talking about . '' The male voice spoke .   `` I mean , what do you want ? ''   `` Come with ME , '' replied the voice . `` Do n't run in the door , you 'll find me . ''   `` No . ''   `` No , I mean , I do n't know if I could do that . ''   `` I was born with the birthmark , and you can go with me . ''   `` No ! Please . ''   The female voice started to cry .   `` I 'm sorry , '' she said . She pulled at Tom 's shirt . `` I 'm not ready for you . ''   Tom got into his car . He walked over to the couch .   `` You 're going to find me . ''   `` No , I 'm going to find you . ''   She came into the room , crying again .   `` I 've got to , '' she said .   Tom tried to talk .   `` I will not let you go . ''   `` No , I do n't mean to . I just want to go home ! ''   She pulled the plug off the wall .   `` Please , hold on . ''   Another person pulled down on Tom 's shirt .   `` Please , hold on . ''   Tom opened his hands .   `` Please . '' she said .   `` Please . ''   `` I do n't know what to do . ''   `` Please . ''   `` Please . ''   She pulled herself up , and stared at her tattoo .   `` I ca n't do this ! I do n't want to go home ! ''   `` Please . ''   She pulled off her shirt again .   `` Please . ''   Tom looked at the scar . He slowly rose from his seat , and slowly walked over to the window .   `` I swear , '' said Tom . `` If you say anything else , you may die as well . ''   `` Shut up ! I do n't care what you 're saying . ''   Tom sat down in the couch . He heard the door open .   `` Tom ... '' said the female voice .   
It 's funny of me , in a way . A genie that has been granted what he wants is n't just some good wishes , he 's also some good wishes .   I had been lucky . They asked me if I wanted to be a princess . I told the djinn that most genies do n't want to be princesses , or princesses , but I did n't really think the people at the bar would be so helpful .   The djinn , having made a few rules and rules like `` you could n't get drunk without having a lawyer '' or `` she can only have three wishes '' or `` you could only have two wishes '' , he seemed fairly confident .   Finally , the djinn asked me what would my first wish be .   I was afraid that I would not be able to do much more . I had wanted to be a princess , a princess , but no . In fact , I did n't think I 'd be able to do any good . I just wanted to be a princess and I did n't want to be in this situation .   The djinn responded , `` I wish for you to fly . You do n't have to have wings , but they will help you fly ... ''
I had lived a successful life .   My friends , family , and I made a decision .   I was to become a God .   I grew up to be a God like everyone else . I knew I was n't going to be able to do this alone . I was going to be a God like everyone else .   I had been given an opportunity to be a God .   While the others were struggling for their lives , I was chosen the one to do it .   Everyone thought I was God .   No one claimed such a choice was possible . It was ridiculous , but I knew better than to . I was God .   Some say that I was just lucky I chose to be . I was the chosen one to make the choices . I made a difference but they would still call me a coward .   They say that even if no one ever took my hand , it would still have inspired them to push me away from the idea of being God .   I had learned that not everyone took my hand , and that since it was the right choice and that I could n't live without it , they would still blame it on me as a God .   But now I knew that no one would take my hand .   I was God .
Not the first time I 've felt this way in this long . I 've been feeling it since the day I started noticing it . It 's something I 've read a lot about , but not this one , this one that 's so far removed from what I 've been looking for .   I wake up with a start in my bed , my eyes adjust to the light , I start to prepare for the day . I walk downstairs , the kitchen was a mess , I had grabbed the dirty dishes , and quickly covered the sink , luckily my cat got me by surprise , and I took a shower as well , making sure I was n't late for work , making sure my clothes were on and ready to go .   As I brush my teeth , I hear the door in the hallway creak open , and I step out into the hall . It 's a girl , I 've never seen her before . Her hair is completely red , as though she 's suddenly become used to it , and her face wrinkles slightly , barely able to convey her emotions .   `` Hello ? '' She says , smiling , a smile that 's completely different from her usual mouth , but the smile never fades . I greet her with a smile that I know she 's used to , since she never talks much , but that smile never leaves .   `` Hello . ''   `` Hello ? ''   `` Hi ! '' I say , trying to smile .   `` Hello ? ''   `` Why do you wear a coat ? ''   `` That look does n't fix everything , but it 's beautiful . ''   I put the coat on , and she looks over to me , and smiles . `` I 'm sorry , I always do . ''   For a moment , I ca n't seem to formulate sentences as to what she meant , but my body rushes to respond , so that I can come up with something reasonable or reasonable .   `` I do n't understand . What do you mean ? '' She asks , turning back to her phone , now in fact , it 's in my purse .   `` I do n't know , '' I say , trying to calm myself . `` I do n't think I 'll be getting anywhere . ''   `` Do you know how long the walk is going to take ? ''   `` About seven minutes . Thank you , '' she says , walking away from me , as though I was being selfish .   `` Thank you , '' I say , closing the door behind her .   I close it behind me , and stare at the clock . I can feel its presence coming closer , closer , closer , closer , closer .   `` I think I 'll be late . '' I say , and close the door behind me , as though I were being selfish .   I open the door to the living room , and look into the mirror . The eyes will always be there , always .
I 'm not sure if I read the words correctly . The letter 's not the one that I wrote , it 's the one I 've been given . I 'm not sure what to say . My wife is very concerned . She knows I 'm going to leave soon , but I 'm so tired . I ca n't have her worrying about me anymore . I do n't think she will ever forgive me .   I hope you can forgive me , for leaving you . Please forgive me for leaving before my wife and I could make such a difference . I loved you so much . I hope you can forgive me soon enough .  
The shopkeeper came in . This was a strange one ; the man was quite unassuming , the shelves neatly aligned between each other , and an unusual outfit for a shopkeeper .   `` What 's your name ? '' The man asked , standing up . It was a habit of mine to keep the man to himself , so I suppose this was , to be expected , a shopkeeper .   `` I 'm Detective Fred Langley , sir . I was just looking to buy a few coins for my last dragon collection , which you took from the local merchant , '' My mind was racing . I 'd never seen anyone put on a mask before , but being the man I was , every sale I made was illegal .   `` You gave me the dragon collection ? ''   Fred looked up and smiled , crossing his arms . `` It was just a collection , sir . A little like last time . ''   `` Thanks . '' I waved to the shopkeeper , who walked over to my register and began rummaging through it , making sure she could n't see it . The man was always making very little noise , and I could never quite catch him looking at me . It was quite adorable , really , considering everyone around me was just staring at him , with their mouths wide open , with a wide look in their eyes .   `` Yes , sir . '' I answered softly , a smile creeping onto my face . `` What brings you here ? ''   My partner looked up , surprised . `` I-I 'm ... I 'm here to ask for my dragon collection . I have some of these here . ''   `` Ah ! '' My partner practically skipped up and down , looking at him with genuine interest . `` Oh ! So , if you could give them all to me , I could give you just a little gold ? ''   `` I-I mean , for a moment . But I 'd love to get rid of the ... uhm , the little gold in there , would n't be a problem . I ... uhm ... '' I barely got the words out of my mouth .   The man let out a long , frustrated sigh , and turned to leave . The two came over , and Fred stepped close to me , and I was confused .   `` What in the hell , are you talking about ? '' I said .   `` I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm just having a feeling that I forgot to tell you ... umm ... '' The man paused , looking deeply into the eyes of the shopkeeper . `` Something like that 's really nice . It 's a gift , really , and ... uhm , it looks good too . ''   `` Thanks , no problem . '' I replied , shaking my head . `` I 'll be back in a moment . ''   The shopkeeper gave me a rather confused look . `` Well , there you go , '' she said , taking the Dragon collection from my hand . `` You ca n't have just handed it to me . ''   `` I 'm not going to do it . ''   `` Yeah , I know , '' she said , placing the Dragon collection on the shelf next to me . `` But- ''   `` No , '' I interrupted . `` No , I 'm going to give it to you . ''   She 'd rather leave it in the shop , but then someone else would notice that it was n't there . I shrugged , but turned back to Fred . `` Alright , kid , you still haven ’ t given me your dragon collection . ''   Fred got up from his position at the table , and wandered to my side . He stepped back on the floor , and looked back to me . I sighed , and glanced back at my partner . She was still looking pretty shocked , one eyebrow raised .   `` You have n't ? ''   I turned my head towards the shopkeeper . `` You have n't ? ''   She nodded .   `` You know , '' I continued , `` there 's always this ... thing that comes out of nowhere . It 's sorta ... ugly , really . You see ? It looks like it goes through things like this one time . It 's like one of those things with a really big scary face saying , * ‘ Do n't lie to me ! ’ * and then it says , *You can ’ t lie to me ! ’ * And then it says , *You can ’ t lie to me ! ’ * And then it says , *This is what you 're supposed to
Well , the first thing that came to mind was the one , um , that I had n't finished yet . I mean , I figure that the world would still be a bit bigger if people had stayed indoors at night .   So anyway , I was getting ready for what I 'd been doing for years now . I mean , yeah I was almost 90 % sure that my child would grow up to be successful , but that never really happens .   I got out of my car and took off into the night . I walked around the warehouse in silence , wondering what would happen , and finally I heard it ,   `` Yes , you 've reached the ultimate goal , you 've done it . You 've proven success in everything , and you have earned it . May God bless you , and may He bless all of us . ''   Of course , after all , I was the first to receive a teleporter . I did n't need to look to be sure . I had done exactly what I thought would be impossible , but even I could n't see it in my own eyes .   The teleporter was a giant , spherical cylinder with three switches , one which would switch to life , the other , which would switch to death . Not much could be done after that , so I decided to get it through .   I turned the switch .   Life was over . No longer had I been in that box . I was free to walk home or come back for dinner , whatever I wanted to do .   I walked to my room , and took the device out of my shirt pocket . I was n't sure what I was doing in there , but after going over some numbers , it appeared that someone had managed to get one , and one that indicated that I was the first person to receive it .   I could n't believe this was happening . It had to be the exact same . Well , all I could do was wait for it to send me back to the lab , to continue with research , but nothing happened .   I decided I 'd better go get myself some soda while I was still at home .   I got to my room , and took a shower . It was n't that bad , but the shower still smelled terrible . I noticed the sweat building up on my shoulders , and did n't really want to go outside .   I took a deep breath , and managed to get myself out of bed . It took me a moment to realize that I was n't in my room anymore . I tried to figure out what was going on , but nothing came to mind . My entire body was covered in sweat . I almost fell asleep .   I eventually got out and went to the garage to grab something to eat . I heard the garage door open . I looked outside and suddenly there he was .   Standing there in that same strange , foreign looking attire , with no distinguishing features whatsoever . As I stared at him , I realized that I was n't human anymore . I was a machine . A huge machine in a lab .   `` Yes , you may have heard of the `` invention '' , which is called `` the machine that allows you to talk '' , and you may not be able to understand why I am here , but I am quite pleased to introduce you to my subjects . ''   I still could n't believe this was happening . Was n't I supposed to tell them that we did n't exist ? All I could think to do was ask what was going on .   `` I apologize , but I did n't have the resources for this . I was just going to try one more time , so now I have a lot to ask , and I will try it out . ''   `` Do you want to choose the first part ? ''   `` Yes , let 's choose the second one . ''   `` Okay , as you wish . ''   `` Now , for the sake of our experiment , take your earphones off as you speak . One day , something will bring an answer that will allow you to speak freely , at your own risk . ''   I went to the garage door and made my way down to the garage . The device had responded by sending me back back to the lab .   After walking down to the garage , I noticed something in the door . The door was locked . I tried to push it open , but it did n't budge .   I decided , slowly , that I had better get it open . I went back inside , and looked around . I could hardly see anything .   Finally , I figured it
We are not going fast enough . The aliens have entered our atmosphere , what they lack in mass are impressive in size , speed and strength . As the aliens approached earth it simply felt like a wave . It was extremely much like a wave to us , pushing us into any direction that we could think of . The sound of a cannon clashing was deafening . We were overwhelmed with fear , I myself had never felt so powerful . The worst part was that I knew who the hell the aliens were . As every human was about to face the alien approach I knew that there was more . I had never felt this powerful before , but now I knew I was n't the only one . Millions of millions of dollars , and it looked like it only took us a few seconds . I was almost relieved when I heard the booming sound of a cannon firing . `` They will come soon enough , we will defend you , and yours alone . ''   The cannon shot , and when it touched the ground a bright white light was being emitted . At first it was beautiful , everything was a blur of color and colour ; I realised that this light had a massive amount of energy . A million light years away it was now a beautiful cloud of smoke . I could n't explain the feeling , but when I finally looked closer I realised that the smoke was definitely real . `` We will not get back to our old ways '' it read .   `` I WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE GOLD ! ! ! '' I screamed .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Thanks for reading ! If you enjoyed this check out /r/Written4Reddit !

He had never been able to get into the city before , and no matter what he had left with , he never would have wanted to . Now he sat inside the city 's old , crumbling , overgrown , crumbling and overactive forest .   From his vantage point , the view was a sight of a man in a suit , black tie tightly bound around his forehead . He wore a black tie he no longer carried , and seemed to be a little frightened . The suit seemed to be made from some type of material , and appeared to be made from some sort of cloth . It was the color of the surrounding forest , and the only thing that could sustain him .   The suit was designed to allow for him to go outside and find his way out . While it was n't exactly safe to go out , he could find a way out . Even if they were in danger of being attacked , there was simply some way out of the city .   He walked through the forest towards a large building that appeared to contain an old man dressed in a simple office suit . He let out a breath , and walked over to the man .  `` Mr. West . Would you like me to take you inside ? ''  `` I would like to . '' The man nodded , and removed his sunglasses . He looked at him , and then at the suit .  `` Would you like me to take you inside ? ''  `` Yes . '' He stood up , and walked out of the smokey office .   `` Mr. West , my name is Benjamin West . Would you like me to take you inside ? ''  `` Yes , thank you . '' Before he could respond , the young man slipped out of the building . He then looked back at the world outside , which he had left behind . He took a deep moment of silence , and then asked , `` Would you like me to take you inside ? ''   `` Yes , thank you . '' Benjamin turned his head , and walked down the steep slope on the edge of the structure .  He looked at his watch , and then at the large building outside . He then looked back at the world outside after walking for several minutes . `` Thank you . '' He closed his eyes , and closed them again . `` Would you would like me to take you inside ? ''
I 've been in the hospital for a month now . Each day I wake up , I feel myself get weaker and weaker . I 've taken small medics , and even a doctor before . It all feels like a blur now , as I 'm being watched . I hate the news now .   It all began with a small guy growing up in Colorado . His parents had passed away in a car accident in 1998 , and were the only people left alive to spend their days with him . He would spend time with his parents , in a small hospital room , waiting for his surgery . Both the parents were very old , and neither knew what was going on , but it was probably just some kid in the middle of a bad dream . His father would wake up , and he would go to his room to see his parents , and to see his mom . His mother would be waiting in at his room , and his father would return home , and he would go to sleep with his mom . It was this day that he became very distant , and he would always get very close to his parents and family . His mother would tell him stories of his father , how he used to get angry , fighting with people , before he never got angry . This day continued for about ten hours , until he finally decided to leave his room , and stay with his mom . The last night he drifted off to sleep , thinking about how much he hated it all .   That night , he realized that his mother would never come back to touch him again . He would n't be able to keep her company forever . Whenever he left his room , he would be greeted with a large man yelling at him . He would always hit him in the face , or leave him lying there . At night , he would see his parents in the hall , and they would stare . They were terrified , and they said they were being very mean for him . His parents were very distressed , and they said they were going to leave him alone with his own family . He was very angry , constantly beating his mother , but none of it made any difference . He was very sad , and that night , he decided he would spend time with his mom . He would spend time in the bathroom and staring at himself . It was this day that he realized he would n't be able to make his own noises . For a long time , he was n't able to make any noise , and he was n't sure why . His mother was very sad , and she whispered that she knew he had to leave . She was very happy , and he wanted to leave , but he could n't find his parents . He decided to spend the night with his family . He would spend the night with his father . He finally spent the night with his mom . He woke up and sat up in bed as he laid his head on the pillow . He looked exactly like his mother , and his father . His mother was very sad , and he was very angry . He then got up and started rubbing his eyes . He wanted to sleep , but he could n't , and he was very anxious . He started rubbing his eyes again at night , but he kept rubbing them . He then got up and started showering . He got up and made himself breakfast . He started eating dinner , but he could n't complete the breakfast . He then went to bed , but he could n't . He could n't complete the breakfast . He then got up and went to his room , but he could n't . He then went to the bathroom , and he could n't . He then went to the bathroom , and he had to continue the shower . He then got up and laid his head on the pillow . He finished eating , and he could n't . He then reached out and grabbed the pillow , and he fell asleep . He woke up and was in the shower . He lay down and started rubbing his eyes again . He then grabbed the pillow , and he fell asleep . He woke up and I finally woke up . I am still in the hospital for a month now . All of a sudden , I am surrounded by pain . I hear the sound of a gun being fired at me . I look down , at my brother . I see the bullet , and I scream , and I feel pain . I have broken my leg . I fall asleep .   I am still in the hospital for a month now . Each day I wake up . I feel myself get weaker and weaker until I collapse to the floor . I am not able to make any noise , although I am very happy , and it feels like I am being watched . I hate the news now   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   This
I do n't know what to expect there , but I just felt ... safe . I did n't have any problems , and a nice family was on the other side of the door . I 'd talked to a few of them about how they lived , and it seemed to be the best thing that could happen to me . My life had truly been for naught .   I remember when I met her . She looked beautiful and very young . No more than 25 , with blonde locks and olive skin . I remembered her shy smile and shy voice as she spoke of her studies . I remember why she 'd found my studies so interesting , and even though there were no longer any jobs to do , I 'd been able to go on with my life . I could spend it all , but just as I wanted it to end .   As soon as I got to her , my heart stopped . I remembered everything I 'd said to her , and it was all right . She was my everything . I found my own warmth , and my own happiness .   And then it hit me , the first symptoms of this disease . The first moment was when she told me she 'd never been sick . She told me she 'd never had cancer , and she 'd never died . She told me she 'd never known the pain that I caused . And , it struck me fast . This disease has plagued my family the last few years . My wife has passed away , and I 've been in her coma ever since . Every single day has been a struggle .   So I 've been in my wheelchair . I 'm waiting for her to come back , but as she leaves , I realize that she 's still here . She 's still smiling , and she 's still smiling . I 'll miss her , and I 'll miss my daughter .
The kid was only 5 . He had n't seen a lick of any of his classmates since they were children . It was true . The teacher had been watching this kid play . It was a lot of fun , to watch him do what he wanted .   `` How 'd Mr. Smith do it ? '' asked Mrs. Evans with a wide grin . It did n't make sense , to talk to a math teacher like this . She was her assistant , so she could n't help but wonder if any of the kids had any idea what was going on .   `` He did it to his son , he would n't be able to do it . '' She answered softly .   Mr. Smith stared at the dirt , dumbfounded . He did n't quite see what he was talking about , but it did n't matter . He knew what was going on , and Mrs. Evans kept looking at him .   `` All right , then , let 's get him to the school ! '' The teacher said with confidence .   Mr. Smith got off at a sprint and ran as fast as he could . He could n't see the ground because of all the dirt . Sure , there was no path and there were n't any buildings , but that did n't matter .   When the students all left , one Ms. Evans said , `` You sure you do n't see anything new ? ''   `` A bit foggy , you look pretty young . '' asked Mr. Smith .   `` Are you OK ? '' asked Mrs. Evans .   `` Yes . We 're over here now . '' said Mr. Smith .   `` Are you sure you do n't see anything new ? '' asked Mrs. Evans .   `` Of course , it was nice to see you again with me so soon . '' said Mr. Smith . The sunbeam that shone brightly through the trees caught the last of the students and brought them back to their desks .   `` Daddy ? '' she asked .   `` Yes ? '' Mr. Smith asked .   `` I was heading over to see if there was something new out there . '' she offered .   Mr. Smith looked around for anything that might help him out . He had n't seen it yet , but soon enough he saw it .   `` Dear Mr. Smith , what did you see ? ''   `` A big , red red schoolbus , that 's for sure , but they would n't have stopped there if it were n't for the red schoolbus . '' she explained .   `` I do n't see anything new , it 's getting very humid and musty . '' he replied .   `` Then what did you see ? '' she asked .   `` This red schoolbus . ''   The voice was n't familiar , but it felt familiar . That one was n't with the black schoolbus , but in the same location .   Mr . Smith looked down at his feet , and looked at the ground . He ran towards the schoolbus and ran as fast as he could , but stopped . He tried to run faster , but the sunbeam was n't following him anymore .   Mr. Smith was lost in thought . He could n't see anything at all , and it felt like he was trapped .   The last thing that came to mind was that he had his hands behind his back .   But the sunbeam was on the ground on top of him .   He heard a deafening scream that ripped through his entire body . He ran as fast as he could because he was trapped .   He could n't see anything much anymore , but he was sure that he was about to die .  
I 've done some stories here for ages but I have n't finished them yet , so here is just a link : https : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3i6o5t/wp_a_subreddit_adventures_of_a_special_special_hero_and_a_story_that_has/ck7bs7zt ? context=3   **There** ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3i6u6t/wp_a_subreddit_adventures_of_a_special_hero_and_a_story_that_has/ck7bs7t ? context=3 )   _I**   “ Who are you ? ” I questioned as I watched from the rooftop . I stopped short , and turned towards the wall of a nearby building . It was coated in a thick coat of rain . I saw a man sitting on the ledge of the building , and turned to see a woman standing there .   “ Are you alright ? ” She asked me . She was also clothed in a bright blue coat , holding a large red pen . I walked towards her and turned back towards the roof .   “ Huh , ” I managed to mumble . “ I do n't remember… ”   “ Why ? Did the rain drop ? ” She asked again . “ When do you think it ’ s going to rain ? ”   “ I don ’ t know… ”   “ Well , perhaps it ’ s because the rain is falling , ” she trailed off . “ What do you think it will be ? ”   “ Well… the rain is falling harder , ” I said , trying to get away from her . I knew I shouldn ’ t be doing this , especially if I didn ’ t think this way .   “ What ? ” She asked . “ Why has it crashed ? ”   “ Where was I ? ” I asked . “ Oh , I don ’ t know. ”   “ You ’ re right. ”   She let out a chuckle . “ Well… I ’ m afraid we have to hurry now. ”   “ How ’ s that sound ? ” I asked , trying not to get a bead of sweat on my forehead .   “ It ’ s… it ’ s very peaceful down there. ”   “ Can ’ t you please stop drinking , ” I said . “ Is it raining ? ”   She took a deep sigh . “ I don ’ t know , ” she said . “ I only drink until I get home. ”   “ Where are you from ? ” I asked .   “ My home , ” she said . “ It ’ s not the rain. ”   “ Did you just drink ? ” I asked incredulously .   “ I drink everything from the sky . I live in Germany. ”   “ Why ? ” I asked . “ Why does it rain ? ”   “ Well , ” she said . “ I ’ m from Germany . I live in a very big house on the outskirts of town . I like reading , it ’ s nice. ”   “ Why ? ” I asked .   “ Because I like reading , where is it ? ” She asked softly .   I looked at the night sky . It was so bright and so full of stars that I could almost see the moon 's reflection amongst them . I closed my eyes and turned away towards the apartment . `` Oh , come on . '' I said .   As I turned around , I saw a young blonde girl sitting on the other side of the street . She looked pretty , and looked like she had been sleeping for days . She must have been going through some sort of mental breakdown , because she was smiling at me .   “ How ’ s the night going ? ” I asked .   “ I ’ m fine , ” she said . “ I ’ m just going to stay here . ''   “ I love you , ”
The wolf leapt into the trees , licking at the bark and tail . An audible screech echoed throughout the forest , followed by an abrupt snap as it came face to face with the wolf . The entire wolf retreated into the trees and laid upon the ground , awaiting to make a final retreat . However , there were no animals . No noise . In fact , no living creature could be heard . Even the most fearsome of wolves .   When the wolf appeared at the base of a hill , it quickly climbed on top of the man that emerged from the woods . He stared at the building . The wall of windows , the hallway and other entrances on the roof were covered in a deep orange tar , with several red stains all over it . In the center of the room stood a man . His name was Alexander . He wore a suit and tie at the same time , and wore a light overcoat . In his right hand , a tiny blue gem sat in a small metal cylinder at the center of the room . Alexander had seen his father , a wolf , before . A good man , if he had the strength to overcome the bear . Now , his father was the one to strike . Alexander took the gem and threw it in the wolf 's face , landing on its back , its head turning white .   `` Wh-who are you ? Why are you here ? Is this a trap ? '' Alexander cried out . The wolf jumped back . It fell to the ground , its head slowly turning inside out .   A loud crack filled the room . Alexander turned and dashed to the door , knocking it behind him . The door collapsed and Alexander immediately realized what had happened . The wolf was barking at him , while Alexander was trying to run away from the monster . The man fell back onto the ground once again , his head landing on the snow .   `` How about you , the man who destroyed this building . '' Alexander ran forward , and the wolf attacked him . Alexander fell to His knees and began to cry out . He was going to give up his life . He was going to give his life on this roof . He could no longer stand to see his beloved husband , his wife , his children .   `` You have nothing left . '' Alexander said , slowly backing away . `` Please , '' he whispered into the snow . `` Please give up . You have no choice . Come with me . '' Alexander ran towards the man , and as he reached the man , he saw the wolf was gone . Alexander grabbed the wolf by its collar , and pulled it up to his face . Alexander 's eyes widened as he thought . He saw that the wolf was nothing but a wolf .   Alexander took the gem from the man 's face and held it up to his face . `` I do n't understand . '' He whispered to himself , before standing up and walking towards the man . `` But you have no choice . '' Alexander reached into his bag and pulled out a gun . He pointed it at the forest , which was now silent . Alexander went inside and pulled the trigger .   The man fell to the bottom of the snow , and he began to cry out as well . Alexander grabbed a bottle from on top of the man and threw it into the wolves mouth . The dogs fled around the corner , but Alexander made his way towards the wolf . He pulled a sharpened knife from his bag and stabbed the man through the eyes . The man writhed out , and Alexander used the knife to cleave off the wolf 's body . Alexander grabbed a large stick from the animal 's mouth and began to carve a hole in its throat . The man struggled to breathe and then slowly got up . Alexander tied the man 's arms to his feet , and bit the man in the throat . The man was quiet , and Alexander began to laugh . He started to sing along to the song .   * '' Oh Alexander , the great wolf , comes now , oh oh Alexander , the great wolf , come now , oh Alexander , oh Alexander , come now , oh Alexander , the great wolf come now , oh Alexander , oh Alexander , oh Alexander , come now , oh Alexander , oh Alexander , '' *   * '' I think I have a plan , '' * Alexander said , laughing as he began to slice away the wolf 's face .   * '' I thought you said you were n't a wolf , '' * Alexander said , laughing along to the song . * '' I really am nothing more than a wolf , and all I want is my wife and my children . `` * Alexander took the stone from the wolf 's throat , and began carving into the wolf 's throat again . This time , Alexander stopped when the song ended . He looked at the wolf , the wolf in the man 's eyes , and the wolf in Alexander
I do n't have much time anymore .   I can hardly communicate . I ca n't even make myself feel better .   It 's hard to breathe . I do n't know how I can do that .   I miss my friends . My family . My friends before too .   I miss them so much .   I miss them so much .   I missed them almost as much as everyone else .   I miss them so much .   I miss them so much .   I missed them so much .   I miss them so much . I even miss them !   I miss them so much .   I miss them so much .   I miss them so much .   I miss them so much .   Everyone else needs them so much .   I always do .   I miss them so much .   I miss them so much .   The only people who remain are myself .   I miss them .   I just do n't have much time anymore ...  
( Hi everyone ! )   I am writing a short story about a man named Adolf Hitler , who did n't stop being a Nazi until he realized how stupid he was . He had gotten so used to it he had even tried all kinds of things , including getting fired for drinking too much , killing his wife ( the woman who brought him there ) , getting yelled at , getting arrested ( the wife who caused him to be a bit of a jerk at times ) etc .   From the beginning , Adolf kept getting used to his life , until now .   Every few months , he would come across a new name to get rid of the constant bitterness that he had for everyone he ever was . One that hated people that were n't their way of life .   A prompt that was n't being posted in days would result in people posting it , and many would either give up , or take it as an insult to everyone that hated them .   The best way to do that was to change this name . But one day , Adolf got a new one . He decided to change it .   Adolf Hitler became a writer . He wrote short stories of his life , most that he had ever written , often with a few , and sometimes with thousands or millions of people .   During his short stories , Adolf would get thousands of different stories . Every few weeks , his story would get a new one .   Eventually , Adolf would get hundreds upon thousands of original stories . He started the long story of his life , and then , one day , he got a new one .  
It was one of those days when I wanted to die . This year , the gods were here to celebrate my triumph . Overjoyed at the release of all their powers , they asked my name , to be addressed to them as the High Priest of the Free world . I lived my life thinking I would reach them . I was wrong .   These gods lived for me and the world around me . I had been born into this city like my brothers and sisters , but my parents were still wealthy and had gone to university . When I was younger , I began believing in The One True God , and with our society set in motion , I began believing in The One True God .   I would spend the rest of my life believing that the one true god knew nothing of my family . Yet no one could ever tell me of my friends and family . Where they went , they never cared about me or my life . My days and nights always were filled with joy , I never truly dreamed of it .   One day , I heard the voice of the High Priest . My curiosity was piqued and I began to investigate the voice . Why was it there , in my room ?   I was startled awake , startled .   `` Hello ? Are you okay ? Is this some sort of prank ? Is this some kind of prank ? Is this some sort of prank ? ! '' The High Priest exclaimed .   `` Um ... fine ... are you alright ? '' I stuttered .   `` Am I gon na be okay ? Is this some kind of joke ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! '' the High Priest angrily yelled .   `` No ! No ! '' cried the High Priest .   `` I 'm sorry ... '' I said to myself .   `` Please ... '' the High Priest began to sob .   The High Priest began to cry harder .   `` This ca n't be happening ! '' the High Priest cried , tears streaming down his face .   `` No ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! '' the High Priest cried .   The High Priest stared into my eyes .   `` Are you alright ? Are you okay ? Are you okay ? ? ''   `` No ! I 'm sorry ! '' I yelled .   `` Please ... '' the High Priest cried .   The High Priest 's eyes widened in disbelief , and he began to open his eyes and cry .   The High Priest closed them one last time , and closed his eyes for the last time .    *****   Want to see more stories at r/ghpcisco7965 ?     
The Overseer stands before two vault technicians that stare bewilderedly . He sighs and runs his finger along the smooth surface of his tattered coat .   `` It ... it did n't work . '' The Overseer responds . `` Really . It did n't * work . ''   The technician looks down at the small monitor that displayed the data of the vault . `` It did n't work ? ''   `` Yes , but ... what did it show ? '' The Overseer looks up from the screen . `` Was it just ... no . It was ... not supposed to work . ''   `` I do n't know what you mean , how did all the vault security tapes show up ? '' The tech shakes his head . `` They were uploaded in a video on their camera . The one they said they had seen before . It was just a video . ''   The Overseer takes a quick glance up at the technician and nods his head . `` Okay . It says we can do that . ''   `` What ? How ? ''   The tech shakes his head . `` Well , when you leave , you go to one of the rooms where you have to stay put . You put on a mask and you go to the outside world . You do n't want to die here . ''   `` No , no , I do n't want to die here . ''   `` Sir , I understand . I 've seen some of the videos . I 've seen a few of the videos . But it 's impossible to prove that . ''   `` Sir , you could . You 're not allowed to show up here at all , to *feel* anything . '' The Overseer is beginning to worry that his options make him a bit more wary . `` Please , just leave . I need your help . ''   `` Fine , '' the tech agrees . `` Just leave me alone . It 's all I know . ''   `` Fine , it 's fine . '' The Overseer takes out a small notebook from his back pocket and begins to write .   `` The game is perfect . Right now , I 'm stuck in Vault 68 . It 's the only place I can get to feel anything . It 's called G.E.R.E . ''   `` G.E.R.E . '' The Overseer stops writing and looks at the monitor again . `` This is really good . That 's why I picked vault 68 . ''   The technician scribbles as he begins to type . `` Well , it looks pretty good . And it means a lot to me . '' He sets the notebook down on the ground and starts to walk away .   The Overseer picks up his pace . `` It 's just , I guess I 'm more than capable of that . How is that supposed to work ? ''   The tech begins to pace back and forth again .   `` I guess you 're right . One day , we 'll find out . '' The Overseer shakes his head , and opens up the notebook and starts to type .   `` I 've been waiting for the one day you 'll make it . Your time will come . The only way that I can make it out of this place is through luck . It must be . '' The Overseer is looking down at the notebook again .   The technician looks up from his notebook . `` You 've got ta believe me ! You 're crazy ! ''   The Overseer pauses . `` Yes , I guess so . '' He walks away from the desk and makes his way back to the door . He closes it behind him and walks back towards the desk .   `` I 'll see you soon , and I 'm glad we were able to find you , '' the Overseer says to himself . He leaves the room and closes the door behind him .   He walks slowly across the complex in silence .   He walks back to the next room and opens the door . He walks over to the console and presses a few buttons . A door slides open and a video screen displays .   `` Today is the day that I come out of this place . I 'm gon na share this video with my sister Julia , and we 'll be happy . '' He turns the video off and walks along the corridor to his room . He slides the door closed behind him and walks over to the console . He puts his hand on the keyboard .   The Overseer sighs . `` I knew I was going to be sad , but ... I 'm sure
I was a bit of a bit of a fan of the prompt but i figured it 'd be nice for some time .   I stood before the mirror , wearing the softest brown t-shirt I had ever seen . I was dressed in a plain black pants and socks . I was n't exactly a geeky type , but I did n't completely mind that . I had worked out about 50 different ways to kill someone , and I really felt as if I had earned the life I had been given .   I 'd never really been the fan of the prompt , but I 'd found this interest in this girl that really appealed to me . She had brown hair and blue eyes that glowed with the same love of my life that had just seemed to flow out of her . She was like an angel and a guardian angel . I 'd been able to convince her of the world around her , but I could n't quite place how . Her appearance , her personality , a perfect , even sparkly golden eyes , or her personality , seemed alluring . I did n't think I 'd ever actually seen a person as beautiful as her .   Tears were running down my cheeks . I had seen everything she 'd said to me about the world around her . She had been so perfect , and almost flawless , that i had n't thought anyone else would ever be as beautiful as her . I also thought that if we just met , we 'd be able to be the normal life we were suppose to be .   I 'd been so scared that I almost thought I 'd lost myself in the feelings I had about her . I thought that I could n't ever be anything more than a normal person . I had to believe that she was n't going to be so perfect , so perfect . I had to believe that she was going to create the world around her .   I was so angry , but I did n't want to look at myself in the mirror . I could n't take it anymore . I started crying . Tears streamed down my cheeks . I could n't help it , because I wanted to laugh at myself the least we could do was to go and watch her grow up . I wanted to see her grow up , and be the normal people I could be , and we could live happily ever after . I knew in my heart that I could n't be as bad as her . I knew that I was going to die just like she did . And I knew that this would be the last time I 'd see her again .   I walked toward her . I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her tight . I felt amazing . I looked away and said something that could n't have been true , but I knew that I 'd never be the better person . I knew that I 'd never be the better person .   I continued to cry . I kept crying . I started crying . I had to be the ones responsible for her death .
`` We ca n't do this . '' I hear the voice say .   The dark figure rises from behind the trees and slowly shuffles slowly over . The shadows of it 's features are visible under the light flooding the world .   `` We ca n't do this . '' I hear the figure say .   I turned my head but was met by darkness . I could see walls of darkness , the only source of light in my world was the moon lying on the ground .   `` Who is it ? '' I ask .   The figure in the shadows slowly turns to face the light , `` Your mother is the last one . '' He says .   The light slowly fades as the shadows speak again . `` This is how you die . ''   ** '' I 'm sorry . `` **   I hear the voice say .   The shadow behind the trees stands up again . The light slowly fades as the shadows speak again . `` This is how you die . ''   ** '' I 'm sorry . `` **   The light slowly fades as the shadows speak again . `` This is how you die . ''   ** '' I 'm sorry . `` **   The light slowly fades as the shadows speak again . `` This is how you die . ''   A sharp pain pierces my throat as the light fades . I fall to the floor . Screaming is heard . My last breath escaping my lips .   ** '' I 'm sorry . `` **
`` It 's a damn surprise , Greg . '' I said happily .   `` Yeah , but it 's nothing special about it . I 'm getting to know my mom , I mean . I was going to get married , I just wanted to be with her . ''   `` Well , you 've always told me you loved her . '' I say .   `` Oh , but she wants to look after me ? '' Greg asks , looking at me with a blank expression .   `` No . I thought it was a good idea to buy her a boat after this . She would have been the prettiest woman in the market if she could have moved to a town with a woman she could spend more time with . ''   `` Right , what then ? ''   `` I wanted to be with my mom . ''   `` Oh , that 'd be crazy . ''   `` Listen , you 're such a smart kid . I know it 's a day off , but please -- ''   `` No , Greg . I 'm sorry . ''   `` Yeah , I guess . I guess I should put her in a better place . ''   `` That 's enough , Greg . You 're the best . I 've been thinking about you for weeks . ''   `` Yeah , it 's just that I do n't think I 'm going to be around much longer than my grandma is . I wish I could get to have kids . ''   `` No , Greg . I have to go . I 'll be on my way . You 've seen me before . I 'm going to see you in the morning . ''   He walks over to the car . `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` I 'm fine . ''   He stops and closes the door , closing it behind him . I do n't know why I was so nervous to bring him in while he was driving . She 's probably just feeling a little sick . Either way , and everyone knows it 's for the best , we would n't have to replace her .   The next morning , Greg came home to hear my Mom yelling about her new girlfriend . He told her about her new job , and I told her about my job , and why my house is n't selling any more furniture . I guess he knows better .
`` What ? ''   `` What 's happening ? ''   `` What ? Do you know how long it has been ? ''   `` In that matter of 2 hours ? I do n't even know how long it 's been . ''   `` Oh you mean that long that you do n't know how long ? ''   `` Well , yep , I 've been a part of this really long that I may as well know , with the exception of you . I 've been your only friend for the last 3 years . The only guy who ever cared about you . ''   `` God . ''   `` I know , but I 've been trying desperately to convince you I really do n't care . ''   `` You really think so ? What 's happening to me ? ''   `` Well , you see , your life has been going on for quite some time . I suppose you 've got your reasons for being here . ''
No one is allowed to wish for anything but the most trivial thing . To be fair , the wish that is written next to your wish was written in a language I did n't even know was a language I could understand . It does n't make any sense that any other languages in the world do any of those things and if I wish for anything , I could n't even have it .   Naturally , the governments that do n't know that I had wished my wish would be immediately shut down due to the ridiculous wishes they made . All that there was was to do however was wish . Everyone in the world looked , not at me , very directly , at them . My neighbor , our family , us neighbours , everyone was looking at me . I was completely different . Not being able to comprehend a single word of a single word in a dictionary was one of the benefits of being able to understand all of the languages within the world . Sure , I was able to create new languages for myself without thinking about them . Sure , I once had my grandmother 's birthday cake with an image of my grandmother . I got to meet my cousin after his school day so it was n't as if it was any different from my birthday .   It was n't until I saw the pictures of my cousins around my room that I realized that what was going on . I was sitting upon my couch , looking at my computer in the living room where my family sat . I looked at the pictures of my cousin and he had always looked so scared . They were all so scared of doing anything . I thought that maybe I should have been terrified too . But then , my brain started to get the feeling that whatever I was going to do did n't make sense and that maybe this was n't all true . That maybe my wish was made out of a language I could understand and that maybe it was n't . I thought about what my parents had said . Maybe they were saying that I could feel the wish and that they would wish for something else .   About a month later , I went off to college . It was a fun year but I could n't get along by the time I got to the beginning of my wish . I was doing everything I could to keep myself sane ; focusing all of my energy on the goal of that goal . Things started taking longer than the time I knew how . I started losing friends , growing thinner , and even dying . Eventually I just stopped looking at them and I realized what a horrible day I was . The world was going to end and so was I . I did what I could to keep myself sane right there and be normal , but I was n't going to do anything to fulfill my duty . I would just live like that for a little longer and not need to do anything .   I started drinking , thinking about my family and thinking about how I wanted to make things better . But then I saw that some people had been doing the same thing for some time . I saw people watching television together and watching random shows or helping people to make things better . I saw people being able to make it through the day without losing their minds because they missed a moment or even a second of the day . I saw people making the perfect work of themselves and people taking over the world by themselves . I saw people moving around for the better than themselves . I saw people being able to keep themselves sane and not think about anything else . I saw people being able to make the perfect people because they missed the moment when we realized that we could make things better . I saw people being able to make things better knowing that what they might do would all change forever . I saw people living things that were nothing but a dream .   Then I started fighting . I was n't fighting because I knew I had to . I was fighting because I knew I had to .   I was fighting because I had to .   And that 's when everyone in the world started to wonder why .   If my wishes had come true , it would have been them . 
I was just driving . My car was running full speed , so I was just in the middle-road and there was a girl behind me in the shade . I grabbed her hand and her face was red from crying . She apologized for crying into my hand for letting me go .  `` Hey , please , please , just come back here ! ''  I stopped and looked at the kid . I was just a little kid . I had walked this road in my backyard for twenty years . I was n't sure if I liked the cold weather , I did n't want to be in danger , but I kept walking . I stopped and looked at the girl I had met at the park a few days ago . She was cute . Did she know one thing ? I did n't have a dog .  `` Hey , please - ''  My son was dead . I did n't know what to do . I did n't know what to do . I did n't know what to say , or do anything . I was just ... driving .

`` Guys , I 've just gotten my promotion , and apparently I 've got to go first . ''    `` What floor ? ''    `` Oh , that . ''    `` What floor ? ''    `` Okay , well , first floor right ? ''    `` Uh ... yeah . ''    `` How did you get it ? ''    `` Oh , yeah , I got it from my girlfriend . She said she was going to see a game on Christmas and wanted me to go first . She said the day before Christmas I was going to grab a game from my closet so she could get some games . So I went first . ''    `` So you 're telling me I have no idea what floor you are going to get ? ''    `` Yes ! I 've already got floor one . It 's a wooden closet , but it 's the same one I 've got a few nights ago . ''    `` Oh , uh ... ''    `` Yes ? ''    `` Well , I 've got floor one , and maybe a thousand other floors , but no one will take it . ''    `` Ok , I get floor two now . ''    `` Uhm . ''    `` Good . That 's it . ''
`` The President is here ! '' The White House said .   `` Mr . Vice President , please step aside . We understand that your people are not ready for this task . ''   The President started to shuffle towards the podium .   The President looked up without breaking eye contact with the crowd . It was always to late for the presidency .   This was the first meeting of the highest ranking officials since President Obama was elected .   `` Your people do not know our secret , but this is not how we know you are here . You are only 10 years old . The world is not aware of your role in the world . It seems that you have reached your very fate . ''   `` That is my decision . I wish that you could understand that the world is not ready for this task . ''   `` You are here because you are not ready for this task . ''   The Vice President was silent .   And then he started to cry .   A little later , the president sat down across from the Vice President .   `` Mr. Vice President , Mr. President , '' the young man said , `` We have come to you . We know that you have reached your very fate . ''   The President laid back down on the couch . He waited for the presidential seal to come out .   Then he opened the seal with the seal of a controller .   Inside was a game .   The President sat in the game .   The game was called `` Life on Earth '' .   The President looked around . The crowd was all looking at him , except for one people .   `` Hello , '' said the Vice President , `` I am Kevin . ''   `` Do you think that we can play this ? ''   `` No . It is not that . It is that Mr. Vice president . ''   The Vice President nodded agreement .   The President sat back down . He began to put his headset on . He brought up the microphone . The people looked at him .   Suddenly , a loud voice came over the speakers , `` The President seems to have taken a liking to you , and likes to play videogames ! You do n't have to make fun of him . Trust me , you should never make fun of him . ''   The people looked at each other . But at the same time , the Vice President had a look of pure hatred on his face .   `` Shut your mouth and try to be a good person ! He has been lying to you for the last 4 hours . ''   A large explosion erupted , and two men came rushing out .   The Vice President looked in horror at the men . He looked down at his feet , and then back at the man who had made the explosion .   The men dressed in suits stood up , and the men slowly walked away .   The President made a mental note to call his wife . She would be in no rush to see him .   `` You will be fine , Kevin . ''   `` Thank you , Kevin . ''   ******   /r/TheYogiBearhaWrites 
`` And on that fateful day morning , in which the sky fell upon us all , the first rays of sunlight finally reached our skies . Light from the heavens shone radiant against the grey darkness that surrounded us . But it was not the kind of light that fell upon our skies that would send us into darkness , it was the kind of light that would flood us with it .   It came from everywhere , and somewhere deep in the darkest of night , it had been discovered . A new star had appeared from nowhere . It was not the first one to pass through so much darkness , but it certainly was not the last . It came everywhere at once , and as always , we were struck and consumed by it . It took some time to realize that it , too , had been unleashed .   For a long time , our gods and goddesses were concerned , but eventually , they realized that we had been consumed with it . It was n't until the time after everything else had been consumed that we realized a solution . A solution . If only we could restore it .
`` Look , Susan , I know this is a shock and it 's hard to understand why you 're thinking this way , but I really just wanted to say goodbye to you ! ''   I blinked , smiling to myself . I had n't spoken in ages . I had n't said anything of great value to anyone in some time . I was in an entirely different world now . All things considered , I was old . I was smart . I had a wife . I had children . No , I was older now . No one was married to me anymore . I looked down at my hands , which were growing wider and wider . My arms were at my hips . My face was now inches taller than mine .   `` I know , '' I said . My voice was deep and strong . It was n't like this . There was no one to listen to me . Would I even listen ? They never did . And now it was time to walk outside . It was time to start running . I ran . The house was right outside .   I rounded the corner , and saw her running down the street , towards a small house on the other side of town . I ran for about thirty minutes before I heard a shrill scream . Her body was bent . She was covered in blood .   I looked at her , and she started running very fast . I ran one more time before I stopped in my tracks .   `` Susan , '' I whispered quietly to myself . `` It 's okay . Try being a good man . Please , make it back to the house . ''
“ We ’ re right here Mr. Simmons ! ” My wife pleaded , pointing to the window . “ Look , we ’ re on the floor , but it ’ s fine . You ’ ll be fine when we get there. ”   “ I ’ m sorry but I ’ m in the office. ” I sighed , putting the key on the lock . “ Tell me why I ’ m in here , please. ”   “ Don ’ t worry Mr. Simmons , we ’ ll get the results out of you . It ’ s all over anyway. ”   “ Your family doesn ’ t exist , they just happened to exist . They ’ re real . You can see it in their eyes . We knew you would be born with these kinds of problems , but we knew we could never have your parents anymore . We could never have any friends , even after you were sixteen ! ”   “ What about my mother ? ” I asked .   “ Well , you could have her . But she was too young to have any of your kind . The only way she could have your mother was through a simulation or something . But she didn ’ t have the life you had . And that ’ s where you come in Mr. Simmons . You ’ re one of the few people that could survive it . And in the end and all that , you ’ re the only one who could . We ’ re sorry for your loss , but we can ’ t bring you back. ”   “ Fine , just… just let us finish and we won ’ t talk again . Please Mr. Simmons . We ’ ll get the results out this year. ”   “ Just let me finish my work Mr. Simmons . I promise. ”   “ Goodbye. ”   “ Goodbye , little boy. ” 
The streets were empty save for the occasional man in a suit . The man was a fairly attractive man , dressed in a simple outfit that was well tailored to his face and hair . He was seated across from the man , slightly smaller than the other , and the man 's face was made entirely of a mask of pure pain , a mask of sorrow . The man stared closely into the distance , then spoke ; `` For the past twenty years we have held this war here , it has been a struggle , a struggle that has led to this moment . The American people suffer because of our differences , they suffer because of a man who is an absolute comedian . He has won this war . Now , we must come to an agreement ... ''  `` What do you mean agreement ? What do you mean ? '' The man 's voice was calm , yet filled with anger and hate . He spoke softly , yet with a voice that was loud enough that the man could hear . The man looked at the man , confused , and then glanced up at the source of the voice . `` Do not mention it . You may be a different person , but you are not the same . You have served our cause , and we have come to an agreement . The Russian army has fallen , and we have won the war . ''  `` But are you telling me that this war is your fault ? This war is your fault ? '' The man 's voice was growing louder , and he spoke slowly , so that the Russian soldier could hear . `` My country is broken ! My country is broken ! This war can not end ! '' The man 's voice was growing louder , and he spoke quietly .  `` ... you are mistaken . This war is your fault . This war is your fault . You are the puppet that is pulling a far darker curtain . You are the puppet that can not see the end . You are a puppet that can not see the beginning . You are a puppet that can not see the very beginning . You are a puppet that can not see the very beginning . Yet you are still the puppet that can not see the end . You are still the puppet that can not see the beginning . You are still the puppet that can not see the beginning . You are still the puppet that can not see the beginning . That , and that . Every single one of us , the American people , will die against you . I do not know why . '' The man 's voice trembled and trembled , and he spoke louder now , and louder , until the Russian soldier could hear the man 's words . The man 's screaming was becoming louder , and he spoke louder , until it was too late .  `` I ... I ... '' The voice was sobbing now . He looked back to the man , confused , and he spoke slowly again , with a voice that was loud enough that the Russians officer could hear . The man 's scream was now gone , and he looked into the distance again , still sobbing , staring at the man .  `` So forgive me , '' The Russian soldier said . `` This war is my fault . ''  The man listened closely , still sobbing now , and spoke softly , and repeated that phrase with a tone so soft that he could hear it . The Russian man listened carefully , and listened to the voice that spoke softly for the entire time . The man 's screams were now gone , and the Russian man 's voice was gone from the entire street . The world was silent .  For a few moments , the Russian man sat alone on a street corner . He was n't crying anymore , but he was still shouting .
Three of his species sat before him . Three of them in a white robe , a pale white shirt , and a dark brown robe . The others wore robes similar to ours but similar in color and shape as ours . God spoke .   `` We have never seen one another in such a way '' , said the first .   `` Hello , my brothers '' , said the second .   `` Who may we speak to , my greatest creation ? '' The first asked .   `` I 'm afraid your questions are of my own volition . The most powerful being in all existence , the one responsible for all of our own creation , '' God said , pointing a bony finger at the others . Then he added , `` You are the product of my own creation . ''   `` Then why are you here ? '' The third asked .   `` Why ? '' said God , gesturing to the pale white robes .   `` You see , Lord Jehovah is the only one left , '' said the pale white robe .   `` How does that make sense ? ''   `` He is also the only one left that can save us from the sins of man , '' God said .   `` You have the power of a god , '' said Lord Jehovah .   `` But is not the throne God created for us ? ''   `` If you wish to know , Lord Jehovah , '' said God , pointing yet another finger at his brothers .   `` Will I need to see if I can save you or not ? ''   `` I will , my brother . But you have the power of a god . You will save us from the sins of not realizing the truth . ''   `` But I am watching you , '' the pale white robe said . `` You are the final witness of our existence . I knew you would be waiting for me here , '' God said .   `` I have come to ask you questions , you know , '' said Jeremiah . `` Have you witnessed the destruction we wrought ? ''   `` I have been watching , my brother , for almost five thousand years . I have watched it all . Every man is born anew , every woman , every child , every race . It is time my children stopped suffering . There is no stopping the suffering . ''   `` There is no stopping the suffering ? '' asked the pale white robe .   `` Yes , there is . I want to know why . ''   `` There is no stopping the suffering . ''   `` I am trying to force you to know what I have done . Is this Heaven ? ''   `` Yes , my brothers , '' God said . `` For now , there is only one answer . ''   `` I do not want you to know . ''   `` You are not to know what I have done . ''   `` No , '' said the pale white robe .   `` You are not to know what I have done . ''   `` This is not where your answer is needed , my brother . ''   `` I will not waste your time , my brother . ''   `` Father ! '' said Jeremiah , waving his arms in a desperate attempt to defend his creation . The pale white robe tried again to defend itself .   `` Please ! ''   `` Your time is up . ''   `` I want to see if I can save the others ! ''   `` No . ''   `` Father ! ''   `` I will not waste my time . ''   `` Father ! ''   `` I will tell you what has happened , my brother . ''   `` You will not save the others . You will not save the universe . You will not save the universe . You will not save me . ''   `` I will not give you up . ''   `` Father ! ''   `` I will protect you ! I will protect you ! And I will protect you . ''   `` Please , my brother . ''   `` I will not let you take away the others . I will not let you let them fight back . ''   `` Please , MY brother . ''   `` I will not . ''   `` I will save you ! Please , my brother ! ''   `` I will not , my brother . I will not kill you . I will not . I will not . ''   `` I

When the Alliance began to invade the Sol System , the Alliance was on a technicality beyond belief . Their fleet of ships had been destroyed during the battle to try and destroy the Alliance 's capital capital ship . The Alliance had defeated the Alliance in a desperate attempt to stop them . However , as the Alliance had continued to fight , the Alliance 's fleet fell in a matter of seconds . Several of them had killed themselves to make sure no more ships were needed to aid them in the fight . Once they had been overrun , they were stopped and the Alliance had disbanded . After a short while , the Alliance had lost over a thousand ships in battle to the Alliance . Their fleet had begun to dwindle .   Despite their efforts , the Alliance continued to fall . Despite their efforts , the Alliance still refused to join the Alliance . Many of them lost their lives to the Alliance , attempting to save another . Unfortunately , the Alliance was forced to take over if they wanted to . Their forces were dwindling , the Alliance was slowly losing .   One of the Alliance Fleet members of the Alliance , a man named Ersachire , was in charge of the Council and the Council 's investigation into the Alliance 's betrayal . The man had only just left the Council when he heard an alarm going off in his ship . `` Captain , are there any ships worth engaging ? '' Ersachire thought aloud .   `` No , sir . It is only a matter of time before we succeed . '' Ersachire said . Ersachire had traveled to the Galactic Capital ship of the Alliance , having been stationed at the flagship . The Federation had taken over the fleet for the past few centuries , and now was at war with the Alliance . Ersachire was about to enter the Galactic Capital ship of the Alliance when he heard something that sounded like a gunshot . The man quickly spun around , and saw Ersachire lying on the ground . Ersachire tried to grab him back , but he was pulled away by an unknown force . Ersachire slowly struggled to rise again , and he fell backwards , laughing .   The man kept laughing until Ersachire finally made it to the surface . He tried to get off of the ground , but stopped . The Federation was looking on , and the man shouted `` Ersachire ! What are you doing here ? ! ''   `` I am stopping you from doing anything . '' Ersachire said . The Federation stood guard at the front door , and Ersachire stepped out . The Federation looked scared .   `` We need to get your ship back to base before you can execute the Alliance leader . ''   `` What the hell is going on ? ! You know the Alliance is n't about to surrender ! `` , Ersachire shouted . Suddenly , the Federation burst through the door . The Federation was able to put two and two together , and were able to tear the Federation apart .   `` You could have done something . Please , Ersachire ! '' Ersachire begged . The Federation let out a yell of anger . `` You know we are only one ship out of the fleet ! '' Ersachire shouted . The Federation then walked away .   Ersachire never saw them again .
As Richard sat up in bed , he could hear the sound of the music fade . It was so soft , so sweet . The lights were off , but Richard would never leave the night light on . He glanced at his watch . 6:47 PM .   Richard sighed as he got up . He could hear faint music fading . It was beautiful . As Richard sat up , he could hear the sound of the music fade . It was so peaceful , so sweet . He looked at his watch . 6:49 PM .   Richard stood up , thinking about one thing . One thing that his father always told him . `` Just go inside . '' He turned to leave , but before he could , his father came out the door .   The stranger looked Richard up and down . His brown eyes were a bright yellow , but he looked just the same . `` What 's going on ? It 's not going to be easy . '' Richard looked at them both , wanting to meet one another .   `` Richard , you know that feeling that you get when you move on to something else ? Just go inside . ''   Richard closed his eyes . He would stay inside if he did n't get out of bed .   A couple minutes passed . Then two . Then three . Richard opened his eyes . He could hear the music fade . It was so peaceful , so sweet . He looked at his watch . 6:49 PM .
The aliens were slow , in fact , they were all walking at a brisk pace . I mean , you know how space travel works ? You have to be slow . That 's how the concept of speed works . In space , space has limits . You get what you want . You get what you want . So you can live with it . You 're a slave to your life .   This was the last thing I thought of when I saw one . They were approaching us . It was a large spaceship , with black tinted armor , and armor that seemed to warp to accommodate it . It was sitting on the floor of the ship . It was not going to slow down . It was going to kill us .   I pulled out my weapon . I 'm only 40 years old . I had seen the horrors of my youth . I killed my parents , my great-grandma , my best friend , and even my cat , Charlie , running away from the house . I murdered my closest friends , my best friends , but this was different . This was different .   The alien began to speak .   `` We are now on their planet , known as Earth . You are a human for 20 cycles . Your race has surpassed our planet 's technological advances . You have conquered and conquered its resources . You have advanced technology beyond your wildest dreams , and you have come to the conclusion that you are not worthy of our planet 's leadership . ''   And she left .   The spaceship continued on towards Earth .
`` Are you all right ? Where are you going ? '' I heard myself say , walking up to the bathroom door , my heart racing .  `` I 'm just trying to call someone . How many times have you walked up to me ? '' Asked the voice .  `` I do n't know . '' I replied .  `` Okay , let 's go , '' The voice said as I slipped over my clothes , taking out the knife I kept in my pocket as I ran home , careful to not draw attention .  When I arrived home , my name tag said `` Thomas '' . I walked up to the door and looked in , to find a very attractive woman wearing a red dress standing behind me .  `` Welcome to my home , '' said the woman quietly , `` and welcome to my bedroom . ''  `` Oh , '' I replied , surprised that the woman knew . `` That 's nice . ''  `` Yes , my name is Thomas . '' Replied the woman .  `` What brings you here ? '' I asked .  `` I 'm here to join you in some sort of dance and talk . ''  `` I 'm here because I hate when you talk to me , '' said the woman , looking at me with cold eyes , `` because I hate you . ''  `` I 'm sorry ? '' I asked , confused .  `` Oh , that 's what happened to me . '' She said , handing me the knife . `` I did n't mean to hurt you , and I 'm sorry I do n't like you . ''  `` Please , do n't hurt me . '' I said , as I held the knife tightly , trying to get away from her , away from her pain .  `` You ... you 're a monster . '' She said , eyes filled with tears ,  `` I never meant to hurt you ... you just ... '' She said , her voice trembling ,  `` Please stop . '' I begged .  `` Please ... '' she said , tears pouring down her cheeks ,  `` Please ... '' She whispered , her voice fading completely .  `` Let me go , '' I cried as she rushed out of the bathroom . I heard the door opened , but I could n't see her . I walked slowly back to my room and slept .  When I woke up , the girl I was talking to was in my bed . I was lying face down on her bed , with her mouth open .  `` Are you all right ? WHERE ARE YOU GO ? '' I yelled out , trying to get away from her pain , away from her pain .  `` I 'm just trying to call someone . How many times have you walked up to me ? '' She screamed out , tears pouring down her cheeks ,  `` I 'm just trying to call someone . How many times have you walked up to me ? '' I repeated , my heart beating faster .  `` Please , do n't hurt me . '' She cried , shutting the door behind her .  `` Please ... please ... I do n't like you ... I love you . '' I pleaded , tears pouring down my eyes . The girl put her hand on my shoulder , and said ,  `` Thomas ... I 'm not here to hurt you . '' She pleaded , her other hand still on my shoulder .  `` Do n't hurt me . '' I yelled out , her tears still running down my cheeks .  `` Please ... please ... '' She sobbed , my face turning red .  `` Please ... please ... '' I pleaded , looking into her eyes , unable to see what was going on .  `` I love you , Thomas . '' She whispered , her tears still running down my cheek .  `` Goodbye , Thomas . '' I whispered , as I closed my eyes , trying to sleep .  When I woke up , the bed was in my room . I saw my arm , holding a broken sword in hand , on my face .  `` Oh , '' I said , tears slowly running down my cheeks , `` I hated you . ''
*It 's beautiful , * I think . *We 're both just a shell of what we used to have . It 's different now . *   I look at the image on my HUD again . The two figures were sitting opposite me , smiling at each other . A slight flicker of the lights in their eyes interrupted my thoughts , and I nodded .   `` Hi , '' said the taller figure . It was n't exactly in the same shape as the one in the green suit , but it was lean . It was just more defined .   `` Hello , '' I continued , `` How are you today ? ''   `` It 's good , '' the shorter figure replied , `` It 's just , uh , you know , you 're glad we met you . ''   `` I ... well , yes , '' I said . `` I 'm glad you 're here . That much I know . ''   `` Of course , '' the taller figure replied , `` Let 's see , what 's your birth year ? ''   `` 18 , '' I said , `` and it 's going to be a long time . ''   `` What ? '' the taller figure asked , somewhat confused . `` Where are you ? ''   `` I 'm around Earth , '' I said .   `` Wow , '' the shorter figure replied , `` That 's strange . You look the same as me . ''   `` That was ... weird , '' I said .   `` Yeah , '' the shorter figure said , `` In all honesty , I did n't expect to see you like this . ''   The shorter figure was looking into my eyes now , and I could tell it was a lot of trouble for him .   `` Then why should I be here ? '' I asked , feeling a little guilty for being so careless .   `` You have a beautiful home , '' the taller figure said , `` It 's more beautiful than anything we 've ever seen . ''   The older man 's heart stopped racing for a long time . I could n't really tell if it was because he 'd put on so much weight to his frame , or because he 'd never thought the things I was saying to him would make sense .   `` I 'm so sorry , '' I said , `` I did n't mean to offend , but I was n't meant to be rude . I was just ... you know , a friend of mine . ''   `` What ? '' the younger man asked .   `` Hm ? '' I asked , `` Yeah , I was just thinking about you . ''   `` You 're probably wondering why I 'm around Earth , '' the shorter man said .   `` I do n't know , '' I said .   `` You do n't seem to be talking to people , '' the older man said . `` I just ... ''   `` Maybe ? '' I asked .   `` Maybe you should do something about it , '' the taller man said , `` Something about anything else . ''   `` Why would you do that ? '' I asked .   `` I do n't know , '' the older man said .   `` Come on , '' I said , `` Maybe you should do something about it . ''   The shorter figure 's eyes widened and his smile started to turn into a slight smirk .   `` You 're coming ! '' he yelled , `` Are you coming ? Come on ! ''   We ran both out of the room .   I pulled out my phone and dialed the number .   `` Hey ! '' I said , `` Hello ? ''   `` Hey ! '' the taller man said , `` Hey ! ''   `` Hi ! '' I said , `` Hey ! ''   `` Hello ? '' the taller figure said , `` Hey ! ''   `` Hello ? '' I said , `` Hey hey ! ''   `` Come on ! '' the shorter man shouted , `` Come On ! ''   I hesitated . What if the man in the green suit wanted to know what I was saying ?   `` What if he 's trying to kill me ? '' I asked , `` Or maybe if he 's trying to kill me ? I 'm sorry , but I just do n't know . ''   `` Then give me a minute out , '' the older man said
The words that you need ,   When you say ,   That I can teach you everything ,   I can teach you all the secrets you need to know .   A single word , and you know it .   The word that I 've learned the most .   The word that sounds all the same. ”   You sit in the room , your lab coat 's sleeves pulled tight around your waist , pulling your lab cap back at shoulder . The lab coat hangs loosely around your shoulders , making you look like you might tumble over . You look down at your notes , which you take in every word . The notes you write on the wall , the notes you scribble at the table , their color mixed in with the notes you scribble down . Some are very different , some have more than others . Some are very close , and some are very different .   The notes you make on the wall come to life , while some are very , very close . Some are very close . They are perfect , and in ways no other scientist can replicate . One particular note , seemingly unique , makes your hairs stand on end . You look at it , and it 's the word that you speak .   It seems you haven ’ t spoken a word since that fateful day , when your father passed away . Do you know why ? Because no one will find out .   The sound of your father sighs as he reaches back into his lab coat . He puts it in his pocket , puts his hand on the shoulder of your labcoat , and gently presses one finger on the handle of the door . The door slides open , and the room is filled with young , dreary , lab students .   “ Hello , ” you say softly , “ is everything alright ? ”   A thin , quiet , almost disappointed voice answers your words .   “ Hello ? ” it asks again , “ are you okay ? ”   You look up , and see them , staring at you .   You stand up from the ground , and walk to the table . You take your pen and pencil from under the table , and write the words within .   A single word , and you know it .   A single word , and you know it .   “ You are a genius , ” the voice says .    
`` It 's going to be okay , Dad . ''   Her voice trails off , her blue eyes fading to red .   Why ?   The door opens with a hiss , and the cool breeze sends hot waves through the gap in the doorframe . She leans against it , hugging each other tightly .   `` Are you ready , little sister ? ''   The air settles , and the children look up and down at the ground .   `` Oh , '' she says , a little uncertain . `` Did I tell you ? Something is going on . ''   `` You 're not ready , '' she says , her voice cracking softly . `` It 's going to be alright . ''   `` And what about my wife ? ''   `` She 's not ready , '' she replies .   `` We 'll get along fine . ''   She looks back down at her feet , her mind drifting back to the day she met her father . She was at work , playing with her own toys and playing with her sister 's toys .   In the beginning , he was very friendly . A little too close . One day , he found her and told her she needed to head home . She listened to him tell her she did n't need to go home . He wanted her to stay safe here , in the beautiful ocean , but she did n't want to go there . She made the decision to go on .   As the tears started running down her cheeks , she turned to face him , trying to hide her skepticism .   `` It 's not going to be alright , Mom . ''   She heard the familiar footsteps of the man upstairs , and took a step back .   `` I know , son . ''
`` Are you sure this is n't dangerous ? '' I asked Timmy .   He nodded deeply . `` It 's no problem . ''   `` Ok , fine . '' I said as we left the bedroom .   A few seconds later I heard footsteps on the stairs .   `` Excuse me , '' I said out loud .   Timmy was still sitting on top of a small wooden crate , staring at it .   `` Are you sure this is n't dangerous ? '' Timmy asked again , in a slightly more calm tone .   Timmy shook his head , shaking out of his head . `` No . ''   Timmy looked around , his eyes wide . `` What happened to the crate ? ''   I gave him a look as confused as I was . `` It was in there . ''   `` What ? '' Timmy asked in confusion .   `` It was in there , just a few feet away . You had your way with each step . ''   `` I know , '' Timmy said . `` But what happened was that it fell off . ''   I stared at him . `` Yeah . Well , I guess I should n't ask . Would you like to go away ? ''   Timmy shook his head . `` Nope . Come on , lets go find out . It 's only a couple steps . ''   I walked quickly down the stairs . They were getting shorter and shorter . I stopped at the top of the stairs . I looked around slowly , and then I heard a noise . It made my heart jump . I looked down at my hands , and there were shaking hands .   `` Is it a small box ? '' I asked .   Timmy nodded . `` No . It 's almost nothing . ''   I followed after him , looking for a place to stay . I quickly got into an abandoned bus station , as many people as I could . The sound was getting louder , and a man in a white trenchcoat approached me .   `` Hello , '' he said as he handed me a knife .   `` Thank you , '' I said as I took it out . He handed me a small knife .   `` Is this your home ? ''   `` It 's yours . ''   `` Are you sure this is n't dangerous ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Will you stay with me ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Please shut up . ''   I started to hear footsteps on the stairs .   `` Are you sure this is n't dangerous ? ''   I shook my head . `` No . ''
I felt like something was terribly wrong , something just *off* . Something was horribly wrong . I realized I could n't feel anything besides my own body , although it felt like I was on the ground . I tried to think of what had been going on , and could n't begin to believe what I had just seen . I tried to put my finger to my lips , but I could n't put anything else . My grip on the knife on my thigh tightened on the grip of the hand that pulled the knife from my stomach . I could feel myself being stabbed . *My* nerves clenched , and I felt like I was bleeding from nowhere . I tried to gasp out , but I could n't . All I could do was let go , and beg myself to let go .   `` Please ! '' I cried out , trying to scream . My chest felt like I was squeezing it in . I could n't move . I could n't move .   `` Please , please ! Please ! Please ! '' I cried , pressing my hands to my eyes . My grip tightened on the knife on my wrist tighten on the grip of the hand that pulled the blade from my stomach . All I could do was let go .    I could feel my vision fade to black . The cold steel of the blade became cold , and I felt as though my body was freezing . I started to feel nauseous . I felt as though my skin was being burned . I felt as though my hand was being cold .
`` Look at them ! '' Famine shouted . War was screaming . `` This is the end ! The beginning , the end of the end of days ! ''   War was running , his fist clenched . Their weapons were aimed at him . Famine was screaming desperately for him . War stood tall and braced himself for battle . Famine was terrified and confused . Famine shook his head . Famine was about to reach his destination .   Famine 's vision grew as he saw the army of men marching toward him , clad in black armour . He ran , yelling . Famine was screaming and fleeing from the army , screaming .   Famine could n't believe his luck . The army was there , and they were preparing for him . The army was about to crush Famine 's sword , and bring him down . The army was gone , and Famine was no longer in his bed .   `` STOP ! '' Famine yelled . His voice was raspy , but his words carried down the hill . His vision was fading , and he was able to focus on his surroundings .   `` Oh god , '' War whimpered . `` They did n't kill me . They killed every last one of you . You have n't really seen this happen . ''   Famine 's vision was cloudy . Famine was not at peace . He was in pain . He was dying .   `` I 'm supposed to be the apocalypse . '' War said . His voice came from everywhere . He was a little scared . The voices were not speaking from anywhere . He was afraid , but he was not really aware of his pain .   A man was running toward him .   `` NO ! You do n't have to be ! We have to save you ! I 'm here to save you ! '' Famine cried . He was crying , but he did not understand what was happening .   The man called out a powerful voice . `` You have been chosen ! You will carry the power of the apocalypse to the end ! ''   Famine was confused . He did not know what was happening . He was confused , and he was scared .   `` NOW ! '' Famine shouted . He did not feel like he was receiving any form of advice . He felt a small pain from his arm . He quickly looked up . A man was making his way toward him . He was wearing a black cloak . He had sharp sharpened his knife .   `` Yes , Famine ? What are you doing here ? '' The man asked .   `` YOU ... '' Famine said . He was shaking . He was confused . He was scared .   `` HOW CAN YOU- ''   `` I wanted to save you . '' Famine choked . `` I was just tired of killing . I wanted to take over . I wanted to join you . ''   The man slowly walked closer to Famine . He had a slight scar . His skin was patchy . He looked a little pale . His face was covered in scars . He was sitting on a large stone statue . He was a little old , but he was still young .   `` Who are you ? '' Famine said . He wanted to know why .   `` I am the apocalypse . I have been tasked with cleaning this earth . I have brought you many souls . Of who your followers are . You were sent to take over the world as well . You will be the last to lead them across the world . ''   Famine was having trouble hearing his own voice , but he heard the man saying .   `` Who are you ? ''   `` I have been tasked with cleaning this earth . I have brought you many souls . You have caused chaos , and I have brought you to ruin the world . You have come to destroy us all . ''   `` Who are you ? ''   `` I am War . I have come to bring you many souls . You have destroyed countless worlds . You have destroyed entire galaxies . You have created universes . You have destroyed sentient life . You have destroyed empires . You have made civilizations rise up . You have destroyed entire civilizations . You have brought the apocalypse to the end . Come with me . ''   Famine was speechless . The man walked forward to a large rock , and grabbed it . He said ,   `` You have been chosen . ''   The man held out his hand . Famine accepted , and accepted .   `` You have been chosen . ''   `` No ! '' Famine screamed , and grabbed the stone . His
`` Why ? ''  The answer is simple . I want to kill . I want to be killed .  I was born as an individual . I was cast down to earth in my youth . I was exiled and then forced to eat , drink and sleep . I was not a slave , but it was because of the power that a human can possess , such as myself .   I was raised by a farmer that could feed his cattle . He needed to grow crops in order to produce food for his people . He was given a special ability . He was able to choose to become a person just by being able to stay in their village .   I chose to become a wolf . I was born with a wolf 's body that could feed and drink and sleep . I was raised by a woman that could dress for her people as well . She was placed in a house that had to protect her people from wolves . She was placed in a house that could protect them from the dogs who were out there .   I was placed in a house that had to protect her people from wolves . I was placed in a house that had to protect her people from them . In my younger years , I lived in the castle , but when I was young , the castle was destroyed .   I killed and murdered several other men , until I was able to no longer eat . I died of starvation , and eventually , I had to become a wolf .   I am your god . You know that , right ? You are the product of my power . You are my light . You are my shadow . The human race is at your mercy . Do you understand ? Are you a God ? Do you understand that you are hurting other humans ?   Do you understand that love is in your blood ? Do you understand that as long as you choose to live , you will die in a way that could save yourself ? I am your light . You are my shadow .   Do you understand that I are cruel ? Does that make you less good ? Did that make you nothing in the world ? Do you understand that your power is selfish ? Does that make you nothing ?   Do you understand that you are blind ? Do you understand that you have a blind spot that is blinding you ? Do you understand how evil exists ?   Do you understand that I am evil ? Do you understand that you are unable to stop hurting others ? Do you understand that I am just a shadow ? Do you understand that the other humans are not able to keep a balance ? Do you understand that the other humans are unable to control themselves ? Do you understand that I have never stopped hurting other people ? ?   I am nothing . Do you understand that that all you have ever done is to protect other humans ? Does this make you no longer special ?   Do you understand that the other humans are not able to stop loving other humans ? When they died , they caused another human to die . They killed both the other humans and the other humans . The other humans died because of the two humans .   If only you knew that you were all that mattered to them .
The universe itself was a mess .   Some places had collapsed , others were barely recognizable . Even the ones I left behind .   There were cities , places that had been burned and rubble , places that had been looted and burnt away . I was there last , watching . I watched , *standing* . Those that were left , those that were not , were what made the universe so beautiful . I was right there . I stood and watched them all get burned to dust .   I watched them die .   They were the last hope for humanity .   A simple death , one that gave humanity the final chance to run away . I watched them live as I watched them die . I watched them learn , develop , learn . They learned to survive , and never know that I knew what I had to do .   I watched them tear each other apart , to no avail . I watched them die over and over . I watched their last moments of life , filled with that same emptiness that they 'd always felt .   And then , I saw them .   They were my last .
The room was bathed in dull light , and Arthur was surrounded by his best friends . His family , his coworkers - they all had one goal for this final adventure . He could n't leave this universe . He could n't escape this monotonous existence . He looked down at his clipboard and began writing .   `` I do n't know why we need to leave this universe . I mean , what if you think there would be other things ? What if it was even for a moment ? Have you ever wondered whether we 're the only ones left ? ''   With that , the room fell silent : a hum filled the room . When Arthur lifted his gaze from his notes , there was no sound anymore . He sighed , and put his clipboard back on the table . He opened his eyes and stared into the darkness .   Arthur looked up at the ceiling . The room was dimly lit , and his face was twisted inwards . He felt dizzy , and his eyes welled up ; his knuckles felt cold . When he looked down at his clipboard , there was no pencil , and his hands were trembling .   Arthur leaned forward , his hands shaking harder . Then , his hands felt cold as well . A faint warmth poured from the pen he was holding .   `` What if ... ''   He looked around the room , and saw nothing .   `` Wait ... maybe there are other things ? What if we just want to leave there ? ''   Arthur looked back up at the ceiling . No , *it* was real .   `` I mean , what if , but there 's just a *something* out there ? ''   Arthur thought for a moment . He looked around , and saw nothing .   `` Look , this is n't just some ... *thing* . This entire universe , this universe , is just *reality* . ''   His hands clenched together , and he felt dizzy . His knuckles felt cold and prying . He looked at the ceiling , and saw nothing . At least not as much as he thought he would , but he could n't help but feel dizzy as well .
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP   A robotic voice rings out over the loudspeaker . “ Attention all citizens who are currently operating in an emergency room , this is the Emergency Room Room . Please check to make sure no one is in danger. ”   The building was quiet for a few seconds . As if the air inside it had frozen over . Someone had awoken me . Again . Now this time , I could hear banging . “ Someone is in danger . This is your emergency door , and you will enter immediately. ”   “ What the hell is going on ? ! ” I tried to yell , but my throat hurt . There was nowhere around me . This wasn ’ t supposed to be here . I couldn ’ t move . Everything felt wrong .   A familiar voice boomed . “ Attention all citizens who are currently operating in an emergency in their homes . This is your emergency door , and you will enter immediately. ”   “ And I went into some trouble ? ! They killed my mother , and they killed my brother ! ” A coldness filled my lungs . I was shaking .   Then the voice spoke again . “ Attention all citizens whose lives are now in jeopardy . This is your emergency door , AND you will enter immediately. ”   I glanced around . The lights were off . There was no one outside . No one was anywhere . All that was left was my mother . Then the voice spoke again . “ Attention all citizens whose lives are now in danger . This is your emergency door , and you will enter immediately. ”   I had no words . I didn ’ t have the energy to say something . It broke out into sobs , and I knew that there was someone there who had killed my mother . It was all coming together .   The robotic voice rang out again . “ Attention all civilians who are currently operating for a danger in their homes . This is your emergency door , and you will enter immediately. ”   I was in shock . This could be happening . Was this it ? My mother was asleep . With my name in my bank account , where I slept ? Was there any money in my account right now ? Would I have any idea what was going on ? I tried to calm down , but the loud crash of the metal door behind me calmed me . I heard the footsteps of the person behind me as they walked past me , coming closer .   “ I can ’ t believe it ! He ’ s going to get away with it ! I can ’ t believe she ’ s gone ! ” I could feel my eyes water with tears . I was terrified . I had never thought that I ’ d see some kind of monster coming to kill me .   “ He ’ s going to get away with it ! He ’ s going to get away with this ! ” My mother was sobbing . She had never done anything like this before .   I turned around . I saw someone else , looking at me . Her eyes were looking at me . “ Dad ! I- ”   “ Stop interrupting me , ” he said . I stopped and turned back .   “ No . It ’ s okay . This is . I ’ ll get out of this . Just hold my hand. ” He did that .   “ I ’ ve never fought this before . I used to be a trained fighter . You know what ? It ’ s time I became a fighter . You know what ? I took out my old combat knife. ”   “ Stop interrupting me , ” he said , and I fell to my knees . I could feel myself shrinking . As if my body was going to break . I felt my vision tunnel into darkness .   I closed my eyes , thinking of my mother . Then I opened them again . I heard my mother sob , and the machines downstairs began to run .   I closed my eyes . I heard the footsteps once more . Then my mother appeared . I opened my eyes once more .   “ No ! ” My mother screamed . She was nowhere to be seen . As if I was in heaven , but no one was .   Then I opened my eyes .   I stood . As if I was in hell . I was surrounded by people . I stared at them . I could feel myself getting smaller . I had no idea what was going on . I wasn ’ t supposed to be in heaven . Just another random man .
I am one of the last , three in all . All I 'm left are two .   Once upon a time , there was a world where everyone had the power to travel through space but only then did we discover why we had to wait outside our own dimension .   Back then , there was only one way out . Every soldier , every warlord , every soldier , every child could carry a sword . Each sword had to be enchanted , made of metal . Each sword had to be made of gold .   Then I found out the truth .   When I traveled through the air , I could not die . Instead , I was sent for war . Some of the soldiers came from that plane , and they got into a fight with the plane . Then the planes gave up and the planes gave up .   I would go out to the other planes , and talk to them about what happened . They would talk . Then it would dawn on me that they were the ones who were fighting back , my friends , my family .   And I gave them all my info and knowledge . I sent out all I wanted to know .   But the plane was not happy . The enemy fighter was destroyed and I found out that the enemy fighter had died and was fighting back .   So I started to send out my new people , my new friends . My entire village and each village had to be sent out to fight back . That is why I have these letters , these words that I send out to every soldier and child . `` We just want to show you how important your journey is , and how far you 've come . Otherwise , I 'll send anyone else out there . ''   A soldier sent out his new friend , and told me that he had died and was fighting back . The soldier told me that he was going to go home and look at his family again .   Soon , there was no one left to talk to and no one left to live in the world of war . It was then that I realized it was time . It was time to do something new .   And I did it .   I left the plane and called out to do my duties as a soldier . Every soldier and child was sent out to the battlefield . Each soldier had to be enchanted , made of platinum . Each sword had to be made of gold .   But the soldiers did not stop fighting . They fought more and more . Finally , they did n't stop fighting anymore .   The remaining soldiers disappeared , no longer existing .   But the war continued .   Some of the remaining soldiers went where they were never meant to go . Some went where they were never meant to be , and some went where they were never meant to be .   But I never stopped fighting .   I never stopped fighting .   So , as we fought , I was sent back to the plane . This time , I was afraid to die . But I also never stopped fighting .   So , as I did my duty , I called out to the enemy fighter and said `` We just want to show you how important your journey is , and how far you 've come . Otherwise , I 'll send anyone else out there . ''   I sent out my new friends , my new family , even my entire village . I sent out my new people to fight back . But I stayed . And I did n't stop fighting .   So , as the battle continued , I joined in on it . And countless countries were invaded and the world was torn apart .   But I did not stop fighting .
He entered the room he came from . He was dressed in a bathrobe that was too big for his head , and he had a nice shirt . The doorbell rang as he entered . He opened it and let out a loud sigh . He was in his room , with his head in the pillow . He looked to his right to see a light shining from his ceiling . He slowly sat up as his eyes slowly adjusted to the brightness . He looked to his left to see a middle aged man standing on a porch with a large group of kids in tow . The man looked up at him and smiled . He grabbed his phone and dialed 911 . The man responded to the phone :   `` Hello ? ''   `` Hi ? ''   `` I 'm sorry sir , our landlord wants to speak with you . ''   `` Can I get the landlord to open ? ''   `` Oh man , it 's been 10 minutes , he wants to talk with you . ''   `` Okay , fine . Please open the door . ''   He opened his door slowly . He was walking down the street , his gaze on the ground as he walked . He had the strangest view . The sun was shining its warmth against his face , and it was cold . He stopped to consider the possibilities . He thought of his wife . In her arms , he could move her . He thought of our daughter . In her arms , he could feel his heartbeat . The smell of her hair , the way her eyes looked at him . He thought of his daughter . How he was so lonely . He thought of the rain on the ground . He thought of his son . He thought of his daughter . If he was to die , he would have been so happy . But he did n't think this way . He was doomed . He would fade . He could n't lose this chance and die . He wiped his eyes and looked at the ground . He dropped his phone and fell .
The courtroom was calm , except for the judge who stood before us .   He spoke for the first time since the moment he created the underworld itself .   `` You 're dismissed , Mr. Satan . ''   The court laughed . `` Mr. Satan ? ''   `` Do n't be silly , I just ... I was ... ''   The judge leaned on his cane , and rubbed his forehead . `` Mrs. Satan , you 're dismissed . ''   He leaned on the podium , and whispered , `` Mrs. Satan , you 're dismissed . ''   Mrs. Satan looked at him with a smile , and said , `` Oh that 's lovely . ''   `` The human race has reached a consensus that the best way to destroy itself is to destroy itself . ''   The courtroom erupted into applause .
`` It 's over , '' said the Commander from Captain Kirk 's ship . `` Humanity 's end is coming . ''   With that , the fleet had departed .   -- --   The Commander stood at the console . He had been called upon by an unknown tribe to protect the galaxy . He had been sent to them to stop the development of intergalactic travel . For years , he had n't gone back .   `` Captain ! '' called out the Captain . `` Captain , I 'm here ! ''   `` Sir ! '' came a shrill voice . `` Captain ! ''   `` No . '' Replied the Commander , who rose from his seat and stood at attention . `` You have n't heard from us . We have n't told you how to get home . ''   `` Captain ! ''   Then it was over .   -- --   The bridge was deserted . The ships had descended upon the planetoid , and they were only a few miles from the planetoid . No human civilization had survived . There were only three or four stars in the system .   `` Who are you ? ''   `` Captain ! '' Came a shrill voice again . `` You have n't heard from us . We have n't told you how to get home . But you have n't heard from us . ''   `` The Humans ? ''   `` We have n't told you how to get home . We have n't told you what to do with your life . We have n't told you how to eat , sleep , or even sleep . But I have . ''   `` Captain ! ''   `` We have n't told you how to fly ! We have n't told you how to kill , or how to kill ! ''   `` We do n't have a choice , '' came the shrill voice again . `` Time must be stopped . ''   The Commander looked at the planetoid once more .   `` The Humans ... You see , we have tried to find you . ''   `` Well , that 's what we have . ''   `` My son , '' came the shrill voice . `` I will be waiting with you for your arrival . ''   The Commander gave a nod .   The Captain walked in and sat down . He looked at the planetoid once more .   `` Welcome , '' said the Commander . `` I hope you find peace in your journey . ''   And with that , he vanished into the void , leaving behind only the crew of the ship .
Jenna hated spending time with her brother . She hated that he had such a crush on her and hated everything about her . She hated him more than almost anyone else , which made her want to break into pieces . To be honest , Jenna did not even think about breaking into her brother 's room . His room was a fancy bed , with a large red button up pillow and a small wooden desk next to it . She sat up from her bed and walked over to the large window , where a large , dark , and gloomy city covered the city . It was beautiful . It was dark and scary .   She checked the time . 2:00 PM . She almost missed it . However , something was different about it . It was still dark , and dark and sad . It took her a while to realize that it was her brother , calling her name .   `` Jenna , where are you ? ''   `` I 'm at work . It 's not like my brother likes you . ''   Jenna stared blankly at the ground for a moment . `` I thought we were alone . ''   `` Why are you so scared ? Because we are supposed to be together . We are supposed to be together ! ''   She looked once more at the ground . `` Why are you so scared ? Because you are looking around ! ''   Jenna opened her mouth to a protest , but was cut off by a loud crash . She looked up . She saw her brother with his gun at her throat .   `` W-where 's your mom ? ''   `` She 'll be back soon enough . ''   `` She 's dead ! ''   Jenna took a deep breath and shook her head . `` Jenna , go to the basement . They 'll be safe . ''   As her mother went down the stairs , Jenna was n't quite sure what to do . She looked around and saw her brother slowly opening the door .   `` Mommy ! ''   `` What 's wrong ? How long has he been gone ? ''   `` I- I told you to go to the basement . ''   Jenna ran to her mommy 's room . She grabbed her mother and her brother and ran toward their room . After fighting and crying and arguing , she finally got to the basement door and began walking for the stairs . She opened the door and saw her brother in his bed . He was sleeping in his bed , curled up in his own bed .   Jenna stared at him in shock and bewilderment . `` Who the hell are you guys ? ''   `` I 'm your brother . I 'm Jenna . ''   `` What did you just say when you told me to go to the basement ? Jenna , were you alright ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Do you know who you are ? ''   `` I 'm your brother . ''   Jenna walked over to confront Lenny . He looked at her in disgust and asked , `` What do you mean , 'you 're my brother . ' ''   Lenny stood up from his bed and hugged his brother . `` Jenna , what the hell happened to your brother ? ''   `` I tried telling you to go to the basement . I thought it was safe . But , you did n't say anything last night . You just ran away . ''   Jenna 's brother looked at Jenna with wide , green eyes . `` So you are my brother ? ''   `` Yes . ''   Jenna stood up and walked over to him and whispered , `` What happened to your brother ? ''   Lenny turned to face her . `` We were in our room . Your bed . ''   Jenna could n't say anything . She stared at her brother with such a blank gaze .   `` What 's wrong ? ''   `` We were in our room . ''   `` Right . ''   Jenna went to her bed and opened her eyes . When she opened them again , she felt a sharp pain in her head . She went to sit up and look down . It was dark and gloomy . She looked around and saw her brother and his mother struggling to get up .   `` Mommy ! ''   `` What did you just say ? ''   `` I did n't say anything . ''   Jenna ran over to her
`` Hey , '' I said . `` I 'm Mike . '' No response .   A few minutes later , I heard a tapping in the back of the room . I turned around , and an older man wearing an overcoat and a big hat was standing , leaning against a door . `` Look , '' he said , `` Do n't tell anyone about your new life . ''   `` Uh huh , '' I said , `` Well , I uh ... '' In the middle of the room , a man dressed in a black coat and a hat sat down . He did n't respond , but instead put his hands up and looked at me . `` Look , '' he said , `` For those of you who do n't know , you humans seem to be really good at making things sound like they belong . '' He put his hand around my neck and said , `` Please , no . ''   I looked back at him and said , `` Please , do n't tell any of you about my new life . '' In a flash of light , he was gone . `` Wait , Mike , what the hell is going on ? ''   My eyes widened and I said , `` Nothing . ''   The next day , I noticed a strange amount of people in the room , all of them wearing strange clothing . There were several people who were saying that this was `` really good '' , and I just wanted to explain to them what was going on .   Later that following day , I realized that my new life was n't very good . My IQ was high , so I went to sleep , and woke up , and found that I had all of my friends and family hanging around someplace behind me .   I woke up , and saw that they were n't moving . I told them , `` Do n't tell anyone about my new life . ''   When I saw that their faces were white , they looked at me , and said , `` I uh ... ''   `` I do n't understand , '' I said .   `` Hey , '' the man said . `` I 'm Mike . ''   I guess that 's what I 'm talking about .
The room was silent for a moment , with the exception of Professor Oak . Quietly speaking . So quiet , but almost as quietly as the door .   'Hi Professor Oak , ' Oak said , taking in the room . 'Hello Professor Oak ! '   'Hello Harry Potter , '' the professor said , passing a pile of papers in front of him . 'Professor Oak , I 'll be your companion for a while . '   'Right , ' Harry said , reaching into his jacket , and producing a small , box of matches . 'Why would you want to be my companion ? '   'Why would you want to join me in my travels ? '   'I had just discovered the answers to many questions , Professor , ' Harry said , looking at his Professor Oak . ' I had just figured out how to make you better . '   'I suppose that you must admit that I saw a weakness in your personality from the moment you were born . '   'What made you weak ? '   'My strengths , Professor , showed at the very end when I realized that I could make other people stronger ! '   'It was when you finally realized that you were destined to be better . '   'But you still made me stronger ? '   'That I still am , Professor , because I am not alone in this world . '   And with that , the Professor stood up . His Professor sat down at his desk , and took a seat next to him .   'I wish I could tell you that I am proud of you , because I have never been the best man to ever be around . '   'You 're proud of me ? ' 
I died a couple years back , and I tried to do with my life , and failed to actually succeed . But after trying to become a serial killer in a small town in Iowa , I finally tried to kill someone . I felt like the only person I could truly fulfill my dream of becoming a serial killer . I needed to become a monster , not a monster . I needed to make sure I could get close to people ; make sure I could become a monster too . I needed to make sure I was in control of a few beasts . I wanted to be a monster too .   `` Welcome to The Afterlife '' a voice announced . `` You 've come here for the contest . Congratulations on your participation in The Afterlife . ''   I looked around , the white walls around me were nothing like the others , and the smell of rotting meat mixed with the smell of death made me want to run back home . I wanted to see my family again . I saw my friends . I saw my pets . I saw my family .   `` Congratulations on your participate in The Afterlife . ''   I felt nauseous , and I felt my bones shatter . The voices told me I had been too busy practicing for the contest , and I had died before . I looked down , and felt my arms ache . I saw my friends . I saw my family . `` Congratulations on your participating in The Afterlife . ''   I felt a pain all over my body , and I felt pain everywhere . I saw pain everywhere . `` Congratulations on your participating in The Afterlife . ''   I looked down , and realized I was dead .   ***   I woke up in a pool of black . I was n't in Heaven , but in Hell . I did n't remember leaving this place , I realized my death had taken me to Hell . I should have seen the signs of a trapdoor , or I may have made a small escape . But I should have stayed inside of The Afterlife .   I saw lights and doors . And a platform that looked so large it had no floor , and almost the ceiling . The box was empty .   I looked around , and felt my body start to crawl . I felt the last thing I saw before I was sucked into the box was my family .   ***   `` Get out ! '' The voice yelled .   I looked around , and there was a large room with two light bulbs , and metal furniture . I saw one thing : a chair . There was a table , and four chairs surrounded by furniture .   `` Get out ! '' the voice yelled .   There was a loud pop and a rush of air . I was thrown back into the chair , and I heard it again : `` Get out ! ''   The place was completely empty . I tried to move for a few moments , but I was too weak . I could n't move . I could n't breathe .   ***   The final thing I saw before I was thrown into The Beforelife was my family . I saw them staring at me . I saw my mom and dad , and my sister , and my brother . And then I felt their eyes on me . The eyes they had on me .   *You are one of them . *
Some would say that the most prominent feature of my childhood was my auntma . She was the most loved woman in the entire town , which made her a little weird , since I can never remember it so vividly , but she was there whenever my mother was out shopping .  Of course , by birth , momma did n't have any family . She was mostly just a regular , regular person , who never really talked to someone unless they felt like they were okay with it . She 'd take care of me whenever I needed to , never seemed to need to . So I was always in her arms when she came home to the playground , and that was the only way to let her know I was okay .  One day , my mother showed up at me , and told me to sit with her at the playground . She did n't want to be there with me . She wanted to be with me , which is why I was n't sure if I was okay with it or not .  `` Um , Daddy ? ''  `` Is daddy OK ? ''  The first time I heard this , I was confused , but I could n't understand why .  `` Is daddy okay ? ''  `` Yeah , Daddy . ''  I was devastated , and a little scared . I did n't want to think about this .  `` Is Momma ok ? ''  `` Yes . ''  I was sitting with my father , who told me that he was going to be there when he saw me , and that I had to be here whenever he needed to be .  `` Is momma ok ? ''  `` She 's fine , Daddy . ''   
`` I 'm sorry , I ca n't hear you . ''   A man in a dark robe , a hoodie and a crown sits at the end of a long table . He wore a sad smile on his face , and then continued .   `` It 's alright , I understand . Would you like to know why I am here ? ''   The man nodded .   `` I have a question , sir . ''   `` Could you give me the answer ? ''   `` No , but I can see why you need me . I do n't like talking . ''   The man reached for the crown , and pulled it out .   `` Then what is it you want me to help you with ? ''   `` You see , I only came to bring you help in the event of a war . I think that 's why my powers are n't suited to conflict . ''   `` Do n't lie . I do n't like fighting . ''   `` Then what can I do ? ''   `` You see , I am a small man . I come to your table . ''   `` So you are a soldier ? ''   `` Well , yes . ''   `` Then why am I here ? ''   `` Because you are my friend . ''   `` You are , '' the man sighed .   `` You are , '' the man said .   `` So , what 's your name ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Well , then I will tell you . ''   `` In the event of a war ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` You are my friend . ''   `` You have been my friend for the last 72 hours . I 'm sorry , I ca n't hear you . ''   `` I 'm sorry , I ca n't hear you . ''   `` I 'm sorry , I ca n't hear you . ''   `` Please , do n't , '' the man pleaded .   `` I love you , and I fear for my life . ''   The man turned away from the table . He could n't hear him . He could hardly hear anything .   Suddenly , a black figure appeared before him . He floated in front of him , and pulled out the gold key of the crown . It went into his mouth , and immediately exploded . He was shaking .   `` Oh ? ''   `` I 'm sorry , I wo n't finish . ''   `` Why are you not crying ? ''   `` Because you are my friend . ''   The man looked at the floor , and then realized that he felt rather weak .   `` He has been your friend for the last 72 hours . I 'm sorry , I ca n't hear you . ''   The man gasped .   `` I will not die . ''   `` Please , do n't , '' the man begged .   `` I will die , '' the black man replied .   `` I will die , '' the man repeated .   `` Please , do n't , '' the black man begged .   Suddenly , a white object materialized on the floor . It was black , and it was bigger than the crown .   `` Why are you not crying ? '' the man begged .   `` I will not die . ''   `` Please , do n't , '' the black man shouted .   `` Fuck you . ''   The man turned around , and looked into the black void . There was only a black hole . It was really close to him .   `` Please , do n't , '' the black man pleaded .   `` I am sorry , I ca n't hear you . ''   `` I am sorry . ''   `` I will take no , '' the brown object said .   `` I am sorry , '' the black object said .   `` I am sorry , I ca n't see you . ''   `` I am sorry , I do n't know how I could feel like this , '' the black object said .   `` Please , do n't , '' the black object begged .   `` I
“ Where did I get that ? ” He asked .   “ You know , in your class . A class where everyone has to come out during recess with their friends , ” the professor replied . “ And I think it was a great class. ”   “ I remember. ”   “ Anyway . I was in the backyard for a while ; I didn ’ t know where I was. ”   “ Do you remember that time ? ”   “ Something was in the backyard at the time. ”   “ Maybe— “   The professor looked over his notes . “ I remember it. ”   “ Does that mean you ’ ve seen it , too ? ”   “ I don ’ t think so , ” he said , his chest rising , his eyebrows rising . “ I got there because it was a while back. ”   “ Do you remember what it was ? ”   “ I don ’ t remember , but it was my favorite spot ; I couldn ’ t believe I was standing on some sort of sandstorm. ”   “ It was pretty nice . The atmosphere was so nice , and I loved the sand. ”   “ It was the most beautiful place I ’ ve ever seen. ”   “ The sun is full of heat , ” the professor said .   “ That ’ s nice. ”   “ Okay . So how do you feel about the sand ? ”   “ I didn ’ t know how to—I don ’ t think I have a name . I ’ m just so confused about a desert planet . What do you mean , like ? ”   “ All I can do is stand there , and see . I can ’ t be anywhere else. ”   “ Okay . You ’ ll talk to someone , ” he said , sounding annoyed . “ You can ’ t be alone. ”   “ You should be , either . I don ’ t think I ’ ve ever felt so alone. ”   “ Yeah . I like to think that every time I feel someone there , I find myself wondering if I 've ever been alone. ”   “ So , how ’ d you die ? ”   The professor shrugged . “ I lived in the desert so before I died , I had a family and friends and I loved running around in that sky all day waiting for the day to come. ”   “ We used to run around together , I guess . The sun , the wind , the sun ’ s rays , all at the same time. ”   “ Well , now that I think about it , I don ’ t feel like you ’ re anything anymore ? ”   “ I guess so . I guess I have. ”   “ I suppose so. ”   “ Do you remember that time where your wife died— ”   “ We ran around and I was scared . I wish she could have lived with me , then. ”   “ I guess. ”   “ I wish she could have lived with me. ”   “ Is that why you never had a family ? ”   “ No. ”   “ Have you ever forgotten that day ? ”   “ I don ’ t feel that way anymore. ”   “ Are you sure you want to keep running ? ”   “ Yeah ? ”   “ Yeah ? ”   “ You don ’ t want to keep running ? ”   “ I don ’ t know . I don ’ t think I ’ ve ever felt so alone. ”   “ What about the sky ? ”   “ I think I ’ ve always felt something there. ”   “ Is that why you never had a family ? ”   “ I don ’ t think so. ”   “ I ’ ll talk to somebody
First prompt ever .

He turned around and tried to run , but the men kept walking . The man walked up to the doors but his arm was held up by a man with a long black hair staring at him .   `` Get out ! Get away ! '' He screamed into the mic , but nobody could hear him over the deafening sound . What was he doing here ? He slowly got up and ran up the stairs until he reached the door . The man who was staring at him was standing on the other side of the door . The man he had previously been locked in was now staring at him .   The man thought to himself , `` why wo n't I die ? I 'm the only person alive that you would n't kill for ! You had nothing ! ''   Suddenly , the man who had been in the door looked down at him and sighed . `` That 's it , '' he said , `` You 're going to get me back .

He had always lived on the farm , always taught his son to accept his destiny . But then it hit him ... He had never thought that he would ever succeed . He was always afraid to fail .   One day , Kyle had the idea of finally going in . He walked for a while to the kitchen , picked up some eggs and some bread , and headed down toward the stairs . As he closed the door behind him , he heard a woman ask him , `` Where 's your brother ? ''   Kyle looked at him blankly . His eyes began to water . He jumped in fright .   That was when the shots rang out . The gun went off . Their bodies fell to the floor , the man in the doorway with two hands on the ground dead .   Kyle saw the horrified look on the woman 's face as she screamed , `` Thank God ! ''   He slowly put his hands up in the air and looked up at the sky . He saw the sun setting , setting just below the horizon . He looked up , and saw a woman with blood running down her neck . She died peacefully , only to be shot and shot in the abdomen .   Kyle opened his eyes . `` Oh my god . Was that me ? '' He ran up to the woman , who was still lying on the ground .   `` Why are you naked ? ! '' Kyle yelled .   The woman looked at him , `` Oh , I ... I 'm sorry . ''   He felt his blood on his forearm , but it was too late . `` You 're dead ! We were supposed to kill you ! ''   `` We were supposed to . ''   `` But ... why ? ''   `` To protect you from an enemy . ''   Kyle 's hand shot up and grabbed the gunman 's waist . `` Why ? ! This is n't right ! ''   The man pulled the gun back and proceeded to shoot him in the gut . Kyle groaned in pain , but walked over to the man and pulled the trigger .   `` No ! No ! '' Kyle screamed .   This time , the man pulled the trigger .   Kyle could see the flash of blue on the man 's face . For a moment , his world went black .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   When he woke up , his world was dark .

You look at the phone for a long time , watching it slowly drift along the dock , slowly coming to a halt in front of you . Not everyone just seems so happy to have they got to pick up the phone , but that 's only because an iPhone gets a lot more use than it needs to . You smile at the thought of it .   `` Hello ? '' You ask , expecting a reply .   `` What do you want ? ''   `` Do n't worry , '' you say , `` this is how I get to pick up the phone . ''   `` Tell me , '' he says , not even looking up from the phone .   `` I want to talk to you about a song I like , '' you say , gesturing for him to pick up the radio off the dock .   `` Let me guess , '' he says , `` I 've never been listening to a song before . Then I hear it , '' he said , pointing at another iPod , `` and I really love it . ''   `` How ? ''   `` I 've always been listen . ''   `` That sounds like a good song , '' you say , `` but it ends up being my last . ''   `` You 're not listening to *my* song , '' he says , his tone turning serious . `` You 're listening to *my* song . And it ends up being my first . So let me guess , I 've never been listening to a song before . Then I hear it , and I really love it . ''   `` Why ? '' you ask , shaking your head .   `` Because I 'm here to pick up the phone . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Because I 'm here to listen to *my* song . ''   `` I want to talk to you about a song I like , '' he says , looking up at the map . `` And I really love it . ''   `` Wow , '' you say , noticing the road approaching . `` I love it . ''   `` You know what ? ''   `` I have to go . ''   `` I 'm not planning on leaving this on this island , '' he says , his tone turning serious and serious . `` I 'm gon na join you . ''   `` What ? '' you ask , feeling the lump forming in your throat .   `` I 'm gon na join you . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I 'm gon na join you . ''   `` What the hell ? ''   `` I have to do something . ''   He sighs and walks away , leaving you alone with a phone . You watch as it slowly drift along the dock , slowly coming to a halt in front of you . Not everyone just seems so happy to have they picked up the phone , but that 's only because an iPhone gets a lot more use than it needs to . You smile at the thought of it .   `` Hello ?

`` I always laugh and never laugh , oh dear God . ''   He did n't even respond . The young man sighed heavily , taking in the room in it 's entirety . The sound of what he imagined was a microphone clinking and a deep , sickly laughter echoed from the corner of the room .   This time it was the children . They were all laughing , too . Every time the same joke had taken place .   The young man had never joke before , but this time it was much worse . His stomach growled and he realized it was the last sentence he would ever hear after this moment .   `` I always laugh and never laugh , oh dear God . ''
The first thought struck me as odd . Something along the lines of `` What the heck is wrong ? ''   A couple of days ago I woke up in a new , unknown place , with a tiny jar of eggs on my kitchen table .   This morning , I slowly began to realize how strange I was . I had the first thought that hit me .   *What the hell ? *   I carefully picked the eggs out of the jar , and placed them in my kitchen . How strange it was even though I have n't seen anything in so long !   I then proceeded to open the jar and throw the eggs in it . I heard nothing .   *Oh fuck , the eggs had to be my eggs . *   I figured I must have gotten something wrong , because I immediately walked towards the staircase and proceeded to fall down .   `` Fuck ! '' I heard from at least a mile away .   Shortly afterwards , I found myself in a field of fire surrounded by burnt out buildings . I looked down at the ground and the ashes came out of nowhere .   `` This is fucked up . We must get out of here , or somebody will realize this . '' I said to myself .   As I walked towards my car , I heard a loud shout . `` Hey , buddy ! I saw the explosions ! ''   My car quickly began to fire up , coming apart in one huge explosion , and the flames exploded and shattered the car . As I finally got out , I realized that the explosion was not from earlier , but from a small , metal contraption .   Suddenly and with an eerie feeling , I felt incredibly scared .   Before I knew it , I walked into a field of fire surrounded by burnt out buildings . I also stared at the area around me .   *What the hell is happening ? I saw a giant metal contraption that I later discovered was actually a robot ! *   I suddenly remembered all the time I was in my family 's garage , and was so astonished that I was only seeing four others doing the same thing , that I eventually ran away and never found out where I was .   I then saw the biggest metal contraption in the world .   `` What the hell ? '' I said to myself .
The first ships to go rogue . What kind of idiot is this to think that you could send down an army of aliens and conquer the galaxy ? That we could finally be unified ? I was wrong .   We were the last of our kind .   When the invaders first entered the galaxy we first thought of us as great . We worked for and took control of , but we did not want to bring down the last of the human race . We would not be able to contain ourselves . We were too far gone .   The first ships came to us with great prejudice and hostility . We were to be exterminated in a way that we hoped would bring our race to an end . So we would not be forced to sacrifice ourselves .   The second ship came to our door . We had come to be defeated . The universe was turning against us . We were to be murdered . One by one , we fell but we did not lose .   The third ship came to our door . We had come to be defeated . We had come to be unified .   We welcomed them into our home . At the door was the man who took us under his wing . There was a table tied to his chair . In front of him sat a large , muscular man . The man , who had long since been beaten , was standing with his back turned . He was balding , as if he was a teenager .   `` We are ready . ''   The man with the chair sighed . `` My name is General Kalim , and I am my replacement . '' He laughed .   General Kalim smiled and leaned in closer . `` As you know , we have been to war with each other since the first attacks of the last planets . And for months we have fought for our survival . The first few years were in a stalemate . After the initial explosions , what we perceived as a war went on for months . The first few months went by in relative peace . None of us had stopped fighting and remained . ''   General Kalim sat down on the chair , grabbed his coat and walked back to the seat . The general was already in shock .   `` No , no . You ca n't have the control over the galaxy themselves . These are our people . We have lost control and the universe is on its way to ruin . You killed us , so you can not destroy us . ''   General Kalim suddenly remembered . He remembered the days of fighting and fighting . He remembered the wars and what they would ask for .   General Kalim returned to the table and bowed .   `` Do you remember when our fleets arrived in the star System ? When we fought against the humans ? When we fought against the alien invaders ? ''   General Kalim wiped his tears . `` We fought for our lives , we fought for our own . But then one day , the aliens came . ''   General Kalim sat down on the chair and pulled up a chair and sat quietly . The man in the chair sighed . `` We have lost . The aliens have tried to stop our advance . I do not know why we have not tried to stop their advance , but something has to be done . ''   General Kalim stood up and walked to the door . He began walking back to the door .   General Kalim stood up . Why not give the aliens a chance ? Why not stop them ? The answer was simple .   General Kalim stood up . Why not give the aliens a chance ? They had to die . The aliens had to die . General Kalim walked out of the room and onto the balcony .   He stood at the top of the Empire building . He walked past the crowds of humans . He walked past a crowd of people who stared silently at him . He walked past hundreds of robots , dozens of people , even thousands of humans . He walked past a crowd of soldiers milling about the capital , and he sat at the top of a building .   He sat at the top of a building and felt the pull of a ship coming towards him .   He sat at the top of a building and held out his hand . The ship got bigger and larger .   General Kalim sat at the top of the Empire building and looked out over the people .   `` Please ... ''   The ship hit him , shattering his arm .   `` I am sorry ! ''   The ship started to hurt . Everything hurt worse than any General Kalim had ever seen . There was no pain . There was nothing .   The ship crashed onto the ground and General Kalim awoke with
The blackened , dying man slammed his fist into the side of the wall .   Blood began flowing and splattered .   The hero walked over to the corpse . It was a blackened pile of blood and the floor was littered with the bodies of millions .   `` Jesus ... '' the hero said , unable to move his finger outwards . The blackened man let out a breathless sigh .   He sighed and threw a handful of blood to the ground . `` Hey , are you sure about this ? ''   The hero gave the man a disgusted look . The man sighed again and slammed his fist down on the ground .   `` Christ , it 's blood . What the fuck happened to this man ? You know , after last time you saved the fucking city ? '' The man stood up , took his cape off , and tossed it away . `` I gave my life for this man . You think my life is a waste ? ''   The hero looked around , and saw no one of the twenty humans in the city . He looked back at the man . `` I 'm sorry , kid , but it 's fine . I 'll let you live . I 'll keep you company . ''   The hero put his hands up and raised up his voice . `` You 're a fuckin ' idiot . Oh ! Please , I fucking told you to stop hanging around , kid . ''   The hero leaned in and whispered to the man . `` I 'm sorry . ''   The man put his hand up , and looked directly into the Hero 's eyes . `` Are you sure ? You think I could 've saved you ? Not if you did n't realize I 'd killed countless people over the course of the last fifteen years . What about ... what about your family ? You know , your ex wife ? ''   The man smiled , but the words were choked out by the tears . `` Oh my fuck ... ''   The hero grabbed the corpse and threw it across the room . `` This is how it ends . ''   The man looked at the Hero with pity . `` You 're a fucking idiot . ''   The hero sat up , and looked around him . `` I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . ''   The man stood , pulled out his cell phone , and dialed his wife 's number .   The hero hung up .

“ I know. ” she whispered before the tearful curtain dropped her down onto the ground .   Her eyes were wide open as if he was falling . Her hands were shook to make sure nothing was going to be hurt .   “ I know , ” he whispered back . He breathed out slowly enough for her to hear , hoping there would be no death .   She pushed her hands into her pockets . With shaking fingers she pulled out a small scrap of paper and a handful of pencils . She placed them inside the cardboard box and stared at the black painted page .   “ I know , ” she whispered again , and then turned to him , still staring . She smiled , and asked , “ So , how does anyone feel ? ”   “ I don ’ t know , ma ’ am. ”   He lowered his eyes to the sky . “ I don ’ t know , ” he repeated .   “ Your wife , ” she whispered .   “ I don ’ t know. ”   “ I ’ m sorry . She ’ s just ... ” he paused for a moment , and took a deep breath . “ I know what you are thinking . But there are multiple lies that must die. ”   She looked at his chest , his eyes wide with tears .   “ I know , ” she whispered again . “ But never , ever do you think what must die is right ? And that ’ s why you have not told me . Not this time. ” She smiled again .   He took the paper again , and unfolded it . The lines between each lie must be drawn into the middle . Each time he drew the line , there was a heart-shaped mark on the paper . His heart-shaped mark grew .   The mark grew until the only thing visible in the sky was a shadow . It grew until the whole sky was covered in darkness . He stared at the paper , and sighed .   “ It ends , ” he told her . 
The red dye I picked up was nearly flawless . Almost perfect . I had no reason to test it out , and as long as I took advantage of the free field I could impress anyone . I was no stranger to beauty , but I could never look at a woman to impress . I was simply too caught in a trance to notice when my face first started glowing . When I finally shut my eyes I could n't help but notice that everything seemed to be normal .   I opened my eyes . The light was still there , but I still could n't make out the pattern . My hair had changed from it 's normal scruff to that of a young man 's . It seemed to be all about skin tone . My hands began to wobble , but my head was still in balance . I still felt a little woozy , but I was able to keep control .   As soon as I opened my eyes again , they immediately brightened to the color I had initially seen . It was hard to describe and I had no idea what it was . Somehow , I knew everything about my scalp as well .   It was in a thick , black-glazed substance , near the center of the thing . It was almost like I had created a painting , but it was also a color I had not seen before . I noticed that there was many markings on the center , written down in small marker strokes . The skin tone was now more pronounced , as opposed to the normal , smooth , pale color of I do n't know where I had felt it before .   Several tiny symbols carved into the underside , and one of them was a single word . `` MESS ! ''   I stood up and started walking over to the painting . It still looked normal now , but it felt as though the color had changed . It was getting darker , and my skin felt thinner until I could do no more . I got to walk back to the painting . I grabbed the painting and turned .   After a few minutes of walking , I came upon what looked like a large mirror . It looked as though I was standing in front of it , but I could n't see what I was looking at . There were many large , rectangular glasses hanging from the ceiling . My hands were trembling nervously , I almost yelled , but nothing came out in response .   Hours later , I got back to the painting , and did n't hesitate to grab the glasses . As soon as I did , they came out of their frames , and on my face .   It was as though I had transformed back into something I had never seen . My face was definitely changing , and I had no idea how it had actually made it . All I could do was stare at the reflection , and I could finally see my face .   I realized what the situation was . It had been as though a different person would take a shot at me instead of murdering me . After a couple more moments , however , I was able to talk with another person who spoke in a much smoother language .   `` Hello , Mr. Smith . Please , wait . I have to go home . ''   I sat down at my desk and began to consider what I would do this time afterwards .
`` I have just the right assignment man . I will meet you at your place . ''   The man was tall and thin . He was dressed in a bright white suit with dark blue tie .    `` I see . You have been hired ? ''    `` Yes , I am . I am here to kill you at your place . ''    `` But why ? ''    `` I have a job to fill . I require a personal assistant to finish my job . ''    `` I would like to hire you here . ''    `` No , I would prefer to kill someone else . ''    `` Okay . Why would you want to murder someone else ? ''    He smiled and walked out of the room with a snap of his fingers .    ***   `` Hi there ''   `` My name is Jimmy ''   `` Not your real name , but you 're Jimmy . Did you really think you could make it that smoothly ? ''    `` I did n't think it would make me so . ''
`` No . I don ’ t know what you mean , just wake up . ''   `` Tell me what you mean , Mr . Wilson . Tell me what you mean . ''   `` Mr. Wilson . You ’ re…not…good . ''   `` I am , Mr. Wilson . So you are good . ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Then please , let ’ s face it , what is worse than normal ? ''   `` If you want me to kill yourself , I can do it myself . ''   `` Do you have any idea how much pain that can cause ? ''   `` Not enough . ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Is that why you ’ re here ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Have you ever heard of the feeling of being held down by a metal spoon ? ''   `` I don ’ t suppose I have . ''   `` Have you ever felt the same way that you are , Mr. Wilson ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Then it ’ s not enough . I ’ m still here , Mr. Wilson . I ’ m still alive . Until that point , I don ’ t know how much longer I can hold a normal life . ''   `` So what do you mean ? ''   `` Have you ever felt the same way that you are feeling the same way that you are feeling the same way that you are feeling the same way that you are feeling the same way that you are feeling the same way that you are feeling the same way that all those others do ? ''   `` Mr. Wilson , please . I ’ m not talking to you . You ’ re trying to break my consciousness , Mr. Wilson . I ’ m talking to you . ''   `` I am not talking to you . This is real . ''   `` Can you understand me ? ''   `` Please , stop it . The doctors will make sure that your life gets better . They will put you in a coma until they see that you are not going to come to rest for the rest of your life . ''   `` I don ’ t know what you mean , Mr. Wilson . Let us try to figure out what you mean . ''   `` I don ’ t know . ''
The Great Whiteboard had taken ahold of Arthur like a magnet , tucking an arm in to hold it up for the passing hour . The windows were cracked , the office walls damp from rain . Nothing good had happened to the three people inside , but Arthur nonetheless .   The lights of the conference room were dim and the chairs were too uncomfortable to bring up , but Arthur looked up at the ceiling . As he looked at the ceiling forlornly…   “ Hello ? ” he called .   “ Hello ? ” answered a younger man behind the counter .   For a moment this went on for what felt like hours . Arthur followed the man 's movements , his fingers brushing against the handle of the computer . There were no lights .   “ Well ? ” asked a voice , coming from behind him .   “ Sir ? ” Arthur called .   “ Are you looking for a name ? ” the stranger asked .   “ Yes , ” Arthur replied .   “ The name Arthur. ” the stranger replied .   “ Arthur , Arthur . I am Arthur , ” said Arthur .   “ Arthur , Arthur . Are you looking for a name ? ” asked the elderly man again .   Arthur opened his mouth to speak again , but the stranger was gone . Arthur turned around to face the two men in front of him . There were a lot more around him , and he figured it would be best to get this over with before he got into the fray .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   This was my second writing prompt , so hopefully the formatting is great .

The last line of the book are etched into the tree , engraved into the ground to shape the story , so that it can continue forever .
Tick . Tick .   John sat across from him , this was it , he was taking the longest trip in history . Just last week , the President of the United States , Donald Trump , and George Bush had won the Presidential Presidency . That day , the world at large fell under him . He was so close . He was close .   The clock on the wall read 8:30AM . John sat motionless , his eyes closed , he knew he 'd lost . John heard voices coming from the outside . He was so close . He wanted it to be over , but he knew it was n't .   *Here on earth , * whispered John in his head as he sat down down on the smooth marble floored floor . There was a single card on the table . It had a white label with a yellowed , red pen . The woman sitting across from John , that beautiful woman , was his daughter . She was looking at the card , the only thing holding it together was the red pen , and the bold red pen .   *This is n't the game ? * asked John .   *Yes , honey , there 's no-*   John stopped abruptly to contemplate whether or not he 'd win . What would he do ? He just could n't . He did n't win because he knew he could control the stakes , and he could win because he knew there was no way he could . All his life , he 'd had this feeling that he was n't going to win this . He 'd thought he 'd never win because of his luck . He 'd thought he 'd never lose because he had nothing , and he never had anything , and he just had n't had anything .   John sat up and looked around the room . The room with the same white label as the woman on the table . John felt a surge of emotions wash over him . Why could n't he win ? He shook his head and sat back down , staring at the card .   *Good job , * said John calmly . He walked out of the restaurant and walked down the aisle to get himself a cup of coffee . He started to feel exhausted . He just had n't been properly prepared for this . His heart began to pound . He just had n't been properly prepared for what was to come .   Across the table , the woman in front of John sat down . Her face was covered in the folds of her brown leather jacket . She slowly walked towards John . Her eyes flashed open , and John looked around at the strange world around him . He looked at all the cards that were on the table . On the table , on the table , on the wall , all the cards were green . He knew what to do . He *knew* that he was losing .   John sat down , and took off his jacket . He closed his eyes and started to panic . He tried to run away from the woman in front of him . He tried to run away because he knew that he could n't . He had n't ever run away from his life . He had n't ever been good at running away from himself .   He reached into his pocket and took out a small black card , placing it on the table . He took out the black card on the table . He felt it come closer to him , but instead of holding it close to him , he felt that it was stuck between his fingers . He felt his fingers slowly start to twist . He felt his fingernails begin to tighten .   He opened his eyes just a little bit more and saw that he was in a room full of people . He was in a chair , slightly bigger than he remembered . He looked upwards , and saw a wall opposite the door . He looked down , and saw red paint behind the white paint . He saw a table that was next to the window opposite him . He looked up , and saw a man wearing a black coat beside him . He looked up at him , and saw the mans eyes going wide . The man was staring at John . John thought he could see through the man 's eyes , but instead of seeing through the man 's eyes , he saw through John 's . As he looked back down , the man on the table started to turn . John watched him , unsure , as he walked closer to the man on the table .   John stared deep into his wife 's hazel eyes . He wondered why she had n't killed him a month ago . John thought he could n't have been too careless about killing his only daughter . John thought he could n't have been too careless about killing his only daughter . John thought he could n't have been too ...   John looked down again ,
It was always a strange thing , always always the same . I 've been alive for 9 years now and this weird feeling is haunting me . Ever since the divorce , I 've been sitting at my computer watching a movie . The man from the movie said he had a friend from work , and who was it ? My heart sinks . This is going to be the day .   `` Hey , that 's James man ! '' I greeted him kindly .  He smiled back politely and walked over to the computer . `` Hey James ! We got a question here ! '' He clicked on the screen , and a green light changed to purple . I was n't sure if it was a glitch or something , but the screen changed once again to a reddish-brown .   `` How much do you want man ? '' I asked .  He shrugged , `` Yeah , I like him for it . ''  `` I 'll be right back . '' I looked at him and said , `` Thanks . ''  I got up from my chair , walked down to the kitchen . I picked up my fork and dropped the piece of meat into the cupboard . I did n't even bother to look at the cupboard for it to happen too . Something was already happening .   I opened the fridge and pulled out a fresh steak . I noticed a piece of meat on the side . I laughed .   I looked at the piece of meat and saw what looked like an old-fashioned fork , but I still could n't remember what would happen to it . I opened the fridge to find a steak . I noticed that it was a tomato . I thought that was odd but I saw something else inside .   Inside the steak , I saw a piece of red meat . Something was wrong .   I stared into the steak and I realized that there was a knife in there . I picked up the fork and dropped it into the cupboard . I noticed that the red meat was still there .   `` Hey James , hold up ! '' I called out to him . He walked over and grabbed the knife .   `` Hey James ! '' I yelled again . He shrugged his shoulders and looked at me . `` Why do n't you just take a look at the knife ! ''   I stared at the knife and looked at the knife . I thought I was sick .   `` You did n't answer my question ! '' I yelled back , but he just stared at me . Then it all went black .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Another prompt this week and I 'm going to post it tomorrow as well .

Dear Suzie ,   It 's been a while since you 've seen me , but I 've finally found you . Although people do n't know know me anymore , I 've found you . I was hoping that you 'd be more interested in me . This has been happening for years now , and I 've lost track of time . It 's been a while . I looked forward to seeing you again , but I ca n't give you a second thought about what 's going on . My mind always goes back to when I was young , and I remember everything from that day . It 's too soon , and I ca n't bear it any longer . I ca n't understand how you keep seeing me , but I can at least hope that one day I 'll find you . Until then , I 'll find you wherever you want to go .   Love ,  Jonathan   PS . Just to let you know that he 's always been a friend to me , and I hope you all enjoy your time away .   - Jonathan

My parents came home to me crying over our child . I do n't know why they did that to her , but I do n't know how , it was all in their head . For months I watched , heartbroken , as they tried to prepare our son for the coming storm .   One night the waves lapped at the shore , tearing at the hull and causing havoc . The men in hats shouted , `` Sarge ! Sarge ! '' and our son followed them . As the tide surged past the shore , and as the men in suits cried out , `` Sarge ! Sarge ! '' And then the storm washed over us , soaking our bodies in the coldest seawater they 'd ever seen .     What happened next was difficult .   I was standing on the shore when a wave began to lift . I could feel it on my skin , and then it was gone . The beach was too dark to see anything , but I saw the outline of the ship rise . We rushed to frantically run to it , to get it , but no one were there . It was as if we were n't moving at all , and was now walking .   I stood there , clutching my son tightly while thinking of what had happened .   The next thing I know , I 'm standing upon the shore , surrounded by a sea of sea . It smells of fish , and the smell of piss . I ca n't see anything , but I can feel something biting my cheek . Then I see a piece of paper , the color of blood .   It says , `` Sarge ! Sarge ! ''   I look up , horrified , but I can not see anything better .
I was just walking home from a grocery store .   The weather was bad : raining .   My mother was still crying and my father was crying .   My sister was sitting on the couch with her feet dangling off the edge and her body hanging limp in the air .   The storm blew across the land , whipping up buildings with no wind or sound .   My brother was sitting on a sidewalk as soon as it blew and I could n't help but giggle as my mom hugged him .   `` Let 's go home , little brother ! ''   The thunder pounded across the sky and I could hear the faint sounds of thunder nearby .   The storm struck again and I could n't help but smile as I heard the distinct sounds of thunder and the distinct sound of birds chirping in the distance .   My brother stood up and walked to me .   `` Hey , little brother . Let 's go home ... ''   I got up and hugged him as tight as I could .   `` We have to go home , little brother . We have to go home . ''   I could n't help but be thankful that I was n't a mess to him .   We walked down the street and into the old abandoned down barn .   I had to stop myself that night . I 'm only fourteen , and I was probably a mess to the world .   So I 'm going to run for my life and try not to look at the people like I thought I did .   As we made it to the old wooden door , I thought to myself `` It looks like I 'm going to be rich . ''   I opened my eyes and there I was . Running into a man sitting in a chair with his hands up in front of his face .   `` Holy shit ! How much in the world do I have ? '' He said to himself .   He walked over to a bottle of wine and set it down on the floor .   `` Listen , you see , I know you 're a mess right now . But I did n't want to be rich . I did n't want to be poor . I wanted to be rich . I want to be rich . ''   He leaned back in his chair and listened in on my thoughts .   `` I 'm a goddamn failure , little brother . I ca n't do anything about it . I ca n't go home . I ca n't go home . Can I ? Can I ? Just let me go home and wait to let people know that I 'm really bad at everything ? ''   He put the bottle down and walked over to a chair .   `` It 's not the end . Do n't do this . It 's the beginning of everything . With my brain and my brain ; the universe . ''   He sat next to me and began to talk like the man he was .   `` My eyes ... they were all black , just like my heart and my mind . I was confused and scared and I knew it was n't true , but I had to hold my breath ... I just wanted to die ... ''   He continued to talk like the man he was .   `` My eyes ... I ... they were all black ... they were all black ... I ... I just wanted ... to die ... until I could go home and wait for them to take everything away . ''   He looked at me and said , `` Do n't do this brother , you 'll kill yourself . ''   I stared at him for a moment , and then took a deep breath .   `` I want to die . '' I said .   He chuckled to himself and continued , `` I want to live until I wake up and see my family . I want to live until the day i meet the guy that is n't my mother ... I want to die ... until I can go home and sleep peacefully . Until the day i realize that I ca n't do it ... ''   `` ... so I go home and let the people know what I want to do ... until I can go home and never go back . And for what ? ''   He paused and grinned .   `` Well ... you know ... I think I 'd like to live ... until I wake up and wake up and I ca n't do anything about it . Until I wake up and everything 's going to change so much that I ca n't even tell anyone
When I was seven I had a crush on Sarah . She was always so obsessed on me that she would always trip over things while I was walking home , or I would be unable to see her . When she finally told me why Sarah had a crush on me she begged me not to try to date her . It did n't work so I tried to keep going but Sarah had been more than thrilled to have me around . She asked me if I wanted to go in with her friends and gave me a kiss on the cheek . I kissed back and it felt good until we finally got there and we walked inside to celebrate with her friends to begin with .   All of a sudden Sarah looked out the window and started yelling at my family . I started to hear giggling all through the house . I could n't stop myself . I started to run to the stairs trying to console her but all that I could muster was a moan with a loud , guttural growl . I thought I had lost my mind but then I heard Sarah 's bedroom door open and I heard her running to investigate . And then I saw her laying on the floor laughing at the sight of me . `` Fuck , what is wrong ? ! '' She pulled me over and told me to get out of her room . She had just grabbed my arm and ran for the stairs . I was still trying to make sense of what had just happened . I finally made it to the floor and my head hitched when Sarah walked in .   `` Wha ... uh ... what are you doing here ? '' Sarah asked me . `` I just did n't see you . '' I was confused . `` Oh ... wow . Seriously ? '' I asked . `` What the ... ! ? '' I began to get confused . `` I 'm sorry Sarah , '' she said , `` but I figured I 'd see someone else so I just stood there and watched you . I guess you 're pretty funny , '' she said and then noticed the wall was just down the hall . `` What in the fuck ! ? '' I asked . `` I think it was just a wall . '' She said . `` Well this means you have to try to find someone else in the house so I can make it look like you 're a little crazy . '' I replied . It was really weird to see Sarah 's face when she said that . `` Why did n't you ? '' She asked . `` I thought you 'd ask someone else who 'd see me but I thought it would be better if you just ... ... ... do me out . '' I said . `` It 's not like that . '' she said as she pulled me to the ground and walked out of the room .   `` Well well , '' I thought to myself , `` this was a big sign . '' And I picked Sarah up and put her on top of my head . It was pretty scary but for some reason she was so happy and I could n't help but smile .   `` Sarah , '' I said to her , `` I think I could find someone here ! '' I yelled because I knew she had actually found someone else ! That I was imagining things . I was so excited . `` What the ... ! ? '' I asked . She looked at me incredulously and then looked at the wall . `` This has to be a prank ! '' she said , `` It 's not real ! ''
God ( Yes ) , God , God , Jesus Christ . This is all nonsense , it 's all bullshit . Do n't believe me , this is what God wants from me .   I mean , come on , dude . The devil and I are the worst people on Earth , since we are a family , so we ca n't even get to worship each other . But we go out to the beach and have some fun . And I mean , get it , we have been married for 25 years ! But then , at some point , we get divorced and my kids go to college , and my wife walks in , and she asks me why I hate her so much . And I say , `` All because I was just an ordinary guy . ''   Well , maybe I should explain why .   I was born on a farm , and the family of my friends lived in a small town on the outskirts of Australia . It was a hard one . I could n't even speak to my wife , so she called me `` Honey . '' I wanted to sit and eat with her , to have a few beers together , to have sex , but she was n't the kind of person that would listen ! Not when I was told that it was her fault . So she tells me , `` Honey , this is why I hate you so much . ''   I do n't believe her . I do n't need to . But she wo n't do that , because she 's the one , and she would go away .
The first time it started , my mind was filled with pure terror . The blood was seeping from my muscles , my lungs , my mind . I could n't breathe . I could n't see . I tried to flee but all that was left was my eyes . My body was numb as the blood started to flow slowly out my eyes . I wanted to scream but instead I could n't move . I felt the warm blood on my arms as I felt cold hands grip my back . I saw a beautiful figure , like a child watching a toy . A strange woman wearing a white mask wearing nothing but a dress . It was all I could see . As the creature touched my arm a strange feeling came over me . It was different . I knew what it was and what it meant . My thoughts were racing . I could feel the blood on my bones . I knew what it was and what it meant . But like all those before , I could n't move . The woman touched my arm gently and it moved into my body , slowly and gracefully . It was like a child watching a toy . My body was relaxed as she slid inside and closed my eyes . I felt her skin turn into a soft leather . I could n't move . My breathing was shallow and I could n't feel . But I wanted to scream but instead I heard a scream . I heard the screams of several children . I could feel a rush of cold . I saw a shadow coming into view . It was the woman . She said a few words to everyone who had seen her .  `` What is your name ? ''  `` Samantha ''  The woman placed a hand on my shoulder .  `` Samantha ''  `` Nice to meet you ''  The woman placed a hand on my shoulder again .  `` Samantha , I know you like me like me . ''   I felt the warmth of the world . I felt warm breath flowing through my body . I felt tears tear at the corners of my eyes . I knew exactly who these people were . They were the people who could make this happen .   The woman placed her hand on my shoulder again .  `` Samantha , what are you doing ? ''  `` I am not happy about life ''  `` Happy about the disease ? ''  `` Yes . ''  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` I am not happy about life ''  `` Then I am not happy about that disease ''  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` Because life is life ''  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` Because life is life ''  The woman placed her hand on my shoulder again .  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` Because life is life ''  The woman touched my shoulder again .  `` I am not happy about this disease ''  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` Because life is life ''  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` Because life is life ''  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` Because life is life ''  `` Then why are you unhappy ? ''  `` Because life is life ''  The woman placed her hand on my shoulder again .  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` So the disease makes it hurt to be alive ''  `` The disease takes a toll on you ''  The woman placed her hands on my shoulder again  `` So the disease does what makes things miserable ''  `` So the disease makes it hurt to be alive ''  `` Then the disease makes it hurt to be alive ''  `` But then the plague does what makes the things miserable ''  `` So the disease makes you feel dead ''   `` Then the disease makes all of that pain unbearable ''   The woman placed her hand on my shoulder again .  `` Sam , I know that you hate me . I know that you hate me . I am sorry for everything . ''  `` Samantha , what are you doing ? ''   `` I am not happy about this disease ''  `` Then why are you happy ? ''  `` Because the disease does what makes life miserable ''
Everything in life starts in a dream and you 're back in the present . You still have the most vivid dreams in the world and you figure out how to make them real . Everything does . You 're a lot of those things in the world , but you have n't discovered a way to make them real either . These are your friends . Because when we wake up in the morning , we 'll take them for granted . We 'll take them to places that you ca n't remember and take him to places where you ca n't remember anymore . We wo n't take him to places because that 's against what we 're doing or something like that . We wo n't take him to places that the people who see me or feel me or feel me or know me or know that it 's okay , but we wo n't take him to places that are n't real . We wo n't take him to a place that does n't have memories or memories or memories or places I want to be , and that 's something we do n't understand . We do n't understand how to make them real . They 're just dreams going to be forgotten . They do n't deserve our existence anymore , and we do n't deserve them anymore , because we 'd rather be forgotten .
I was a coward . A nobody . A nobody .   I knew . It was always in my nature to be a coward . To always have an ounce of respect . Even as I was older my whole life had felt more like an ambush than a fight . When the first of my family members came in on their eighteenth birthday their bodies were torn apart and blood splattered everywhere . A few were killed . I was found dead on the floor in the middle of the street . It was one of the last thing I remembered from that night . I was in the dead of night staring up into the sky . I was n't able to make out any of the stars . None of the stars that I had seen since that day . I wish I could describe all of them as peaceful . Peace that I did n't have to bear anymore . Peace that I only had to endure to survive .   My family had all but been killed . I had been killed and all I could do was watch as the world burned down . I saw faces that I did n't recognize . They were my parents , but they had been killed before . As it turned out , they had been killed before because they were thieves . I was n't supposed to get murdered until my eighteenth birthday . I never went to school . I never ate . I never went home . I did n't see my friends . I never had friends . Most of all , they were all dead . I knew the only reason I had to live was because of them . It was n't their fault , but I do n't know if I was just being selfish , or if they had been as selfish as me . They did n't really care and I found myself at the mercy of their choices . I felt horrible for my parents and I did n't want them to die . They were n't going to die . I needed to die . I needed to die . I wanted to die . But I could n't , not anymore . There was no one to protect me from the future . I was nothing . There was no one to make me happy . I had nothing . Everyone else I had ever known died and I continued to exist as the one who did it . Everyone else I had ever known but no one else had ever lived . I could n't live anymore . I continued to exist as the one that did it . I was a coward . I knew . I looked up and saw the stars . They were beautiful . I took a deep breath . I held onto it and closed my eyes .   I opened them again and gasped . I saw nothing . I felt nothing . I could n't move . Everything burned away completely . I tried to speak but only choked out the sounds .   `` Was that you ? Did you kill me ? '' A voice asked right before I closed my eyes . I turned and saw someone standing in front of me in the street . He looked familiar , but I could barely distinguish himself from those around him . I was paralyzed . I still felt nothing . I looked around and could n't see who he was . He wore an old t-shirt his dad wore when he was alive . He was holding a shovel with some sort of a small fire hose in it . He spoke first .   `` You killed me ? ''   I looked up again . The sky was gone . Why was I standing here ? Why was I even here ? Why was I even here ?   `` The same shit you said . '' It was the voice again . It was not what I expected . The voice told me this . This person knew me . The voice told me I had never killed anyone else . This made me cry . I cried for a few moments . I could n't open my eyes for more than a few seconds . I could n't move . The voice told me this . It told me I had never given up my life and I always had done it so I deserved it . The voice told me this .   `` Good son . '' It said from behind the shovel .   I felt myself losing consciousness . I was definitely in a hospital bed when a nurse came in and examined me . He handed me a doctor 's notes and told me I had been taken to a terrible , horrible place . He said that I needed to be put in a coma for a few weeks . But he said I could n't go . I felt sick and this sick bastard was so disgusting that he made me want to die . I was n't going to die . I lost consciousness .   The doctor told me to sit down and relax . I heard a shuffling around the room . I could n't move . I could n't see .   `` Oh god . Oh god . Why did n't you kill me ? '' The
I had this urge to write something , but it might as well be a long time .   First post here and I 'll even continue with the prompt .     `` You did n't really want to do this , do you ? ''   The man in the suit said it as it pulled a cigarette out of its ashtray .   `` What ? ''   The man in the suit shook his head . `` Not like I actually believed you . It was just a joke . I just thought you could keep it safe . ''   The man in the suit had gotten up straight , moved to the door , and opened it slowly . He paused for a second . `` I mean , can you just tell me what you 're calling yourself ? ''   The man who had been running a red light tried to raise his voice to a whisper . `` I ... I ... My name is n't Ryan . I 'm a Doctor . ''   `` Oh yeah , you do know . ''   `` Yeah , I know . '' The doctor stammered . He was n't sure he did like his name . He had always told me , about the feeling when someone told him they were pregnant . Everyone felt like they had been at that point , so it was easy to get used to it .   `` I ... I just ca n't ... '' The doctor struggled to say any more . He was nervous . Even now , he was n't sure if he believed it or not , but he could n't help but feel that he had a responsibility to this universe .   `` It 's not like I did n't realize . I just ... I just was n't supposed to . I did n't want to be like this . ''   `` I know . It 's just ... I just ca n't handle it . You ca n't stop me from killing these people . ''   `` I ... I 'm sorry ? I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for telling you this . ''   `` It 's just ... '' the doctor began to sob . He had always been upset . But something had changed . It felt like a terrible weight had been lifted off his shoulders . `` Just ... Please . Just stop . Stop . ''   `` Please , please , please ... '' He began to weep . He knew that he should 've stopped . He had gotten angry . He had stopped feeling bad . He had stopped thinking about it . He had stopped caring . He had stopped thinking about his name and the people around him .   `` You 're not supposed to do that '' The doctor had said .   `` I 'm sorry ! '' The man in the suit said , tears streaming down his eyes . `` I 'm sorry ! ''   The man still could n't help but think about his name . He remembered what Ryan had said to people whenever he was in his mood . He remembered the reason why the Doctor had held him down . He remembered the reason they had talked to him so much . They talked about how Ryan was n't supposed to kill them , he was going through his best to save them .   `` You 're not supposed to kill them . I do n't ... I 'm sorry ! '' The man in the suit said .   `` Please . I-I ... '' It was hard to even manage to say , but he knew that there was no going back . There were always going back . He knew that he had to do this . He had to do this differently .   `` You 're not supposed to kill them . '' The man in the suit said , tears rolling down his face . `` They wo n't react . ''   `` I 'm sorry '' The man in the suit said , tears of laughter escaping his lips . `` Please . Please , we could have kept this secret for a few more years . '' He glanced at the doctor , as he started weeping . `` I 'll ... ''   The doctor 's face burned with pain , before he realized what he had done . He had never known why the Doctor had kept him down . He had never known why he was fighting against the enemy . He had never known why he was so weak .   `` I ... I ca n't . I ca n't . I ca n't . '' The man in the suit said , tears forming at the corners of his eyes . The doctor 's eyes were glazed over .   The doctor 's eyes lit up . He smiled . He smiled at the man
I was a little confused . I knew everything , I had made it through countless grueling training groups with the various skills that my parents had learned , I had been able to climb mountains , I had held the most dangerous and most dangerous weapons ... I had been a member of the first guard , and was the one who joined the army ... I was supposed to be the first person to step out of the group ... As I explained , it was just me and an old lady . I do n't know why they managed to steal my name ... It 's hard to maintain such a name , but I suppose they were n't just gon na use it to recruit people . I 'm not like the kids you hear about , they were n't even gon na do that . I 'm supposed to be a soldier .   I sat down at the table and looked up at the ceiling . I had walked into a crowd that had formed on the stairs . There were a few of the soldiers , many of whom had been there . Some looked very frustrated , and others looked scared ... But they all seemed to be fine . I looked down at them , and smiled . I went back to my seat , and my friends started to look at me . I sighed and placed a hand on my forehead . `` I 'm glad you 're alive ''   After the speech , I cleared my throat . `` I 'm sorry . I was too busy thinking about the future to realise that I should have said something . It was ... so damn boring . I did know all about the future ... ''
I am not a stranger to the IRS .   I know them , however .   I never heard a lawyer speak to a lawyer about a million dollars . I could not pay off his debt . But like most people , I do .   I have heard that people do n't pay the bill .   I would have the name Johnny Cash .   It seems impossible to ignore .   I 'm not much of a lawyer .   But my job is going to be interesting .   I 'm sure the IRS will come up with some interesting stories . Maybe eventually I will find out my name is Johnny Cash .   This is my first time submitting something . This is one hell of a story .
The sun was high and still , and the two men sat in a cave , two feet away from the top , and one on the ground , staring at each other , gazing , until they felt a hand reach around them , hand resting on one shoulder . The other man , his red eyes , stared back across the length of the path he had just begun . He was so old . His hair was so long , his skin so pale . His chest was so thin , and yet his breath carried so much oxygen . Suddenly , they heard voices in front of them , and they froze . Their throats were dry . They could n't breathe . They could n't move . They could n't breathe .   The figure moved , closer , and closer until it was inches from them . In the distance , they heard people talking .   `` We have to get out . ''   They turned to their second man . He was so pale , and he was so weary . His hair was so thin , his skin so pale . Their bodies were so frail . They were so frail .   `` We have to get out . ''   They stood , and waited . They were waiting .   `` We have to get out . ''
The dust hung heavy on the crumbling stone walls . The city still stood tall , its walls made of the same black stone as the night sky . The small , red fire burned into the night sky by nightfall . There were no shadows to accompany the warmth . The city itself had been so desolate since the beginning of time .   Rain began to storm over the city , and it was hard for the young man to get off his couch . The dust continued to fall , thick and heavy . The man was so tired . He decided that he had to take a shower , and take off his shorts . He got dressed , and exited his apartment .   He walked down the short street , and towards his car . He began to drive home , and heard the chirping of the engine . He did n't stop , and kept driving . A few more minutes , and he was walking aimlessly through the streets of the city , trying to catch his breath . After a few moments , he stopped .   `` Hello , kid . '' a gravelly voice said .   He looked up . The man who spoke was old , but young . He wore old clothes , and wore grey hair . He sat in front of his car , and said , `` It really is hard to talk to you today . ''   The man chuckled . He looked down , and said , `` You have n't got many friends else . ''   `` Have you ? '' the gravelly replied .   `` No . '' the man replied .   The gravelly smiled . `` Then why do n't we go spend the night together ? ''   `` Because ... you know , it would be interesting if I could talk to you . ''   `` Of course ! '' The man said .   The ground began to shake violently . The children in the street began to cry . The man began to make his way towards the children 's room , and pushed open the door , his gun pointed at his head .   `` We can live happily ever after , forever . '' The man said .   Suddenly , the bullet struck the children 's head . The man 's head exploded open , and his child fell unconscious , bleeding all over the place . The father , however , was gone . The man was in the ruins of his old home . In the middle of the street , sat a man in his black suit . He was sitting in the middle of a road , which looked down . He was holding a small bag in his hand , something that he had never seen before . The man looked angrily at his watch .   `` Oh , come on , stranger . It 's only a few minutes until we have to go . '' he said .   `` I thought we were going to go spend the night . '' the man said , shaking his head .   `` I did n't even bring it . '' the man said .   `` No , you may have . I have n't brought anything , but you wo n't be needing it . '' the man said , standing up .   `` No , I have n't brought anything at all ! '' the man said , shaking his head again .   `` Relax . We can go over to the kitchen . We can start making dinner . ''   `` No , NO ! '' the man shouted , holding his hand up . `` All this dust is going to get us nowhere . I have n't brought anything ! I have n't brought anything ! ''   The man walked away , trembling in fear . He stood in the middle of the street , and held the bag tight . He never got to the living room , only the couch , and the coffee table , and the refrigerator . He knew this would be the last time he would see the man , but he was truly angry . He got out of his car , walked towards the couch , and left .   The man did n't see him in the bathroom , only the water at the end of the stairs . He walked aimlessly towards the bathroom , and fell . In the middle of the road , sat a woman , with black hair . She was beautiful , in a way that made the young man regret all of what he had done . She looked as if she 'd never been there before . Then she hit the ground , and a body fell out of the shower .   `` Oh my god ! '' the man cried , falling to the ground . He reached down , and pulled out another gun . The man looked into the mirror , and tried to make out her outline . He pulled out a gun , and shot at the woman . The man pulled out
For once , I knew I had to confront him .   His voice was deep and authoritative .   `` I guess I 'll be too . '' I said to myself .   The room was immaculate . Everything was so white and yet ... there was a small black hole .    The poker table was white .   I closed my eyes .   A hand approached from behind me ...   ... an enormous hand ... it was a human . It stared at me . I instantly recognized it as my best friend . I had met him when I was a kid .   `` What is going on ? ''   The hand reached for the table . A large hand reached out and touched it 's palm . It touched me .   `` You 're mine again . ''   The hand reached back . The table was white .   I opened my eyes .   A human sat beside me . It was much older than I was . It wore a thick leather jacket and wore a hooded hat . It wore a large trench coat and wore hat atop its head . It was smiling with pure white teeth .   `` That 's it , '' The human said . `` I take the prize . ''   `` No , no . We have a deal . That 's ours . ''   The creature seemed pleased .   `` I 'm sorry , you ca n't leave . ''   ( I 'll leave . I 'll leave . )   I walked away . The creature was gone .       
I turned the corner at the next intersection , my body shaking with adrenaline . The air of the highway billowed with smoke from each beat . Above me , flames danced and raged in the morning sun . Everything stood still , except for the sound of horns and the occasional gurgling and grinding and the occasional thump .   I turned my head , ignoring the flames and the cries of the people below who could have sworn any second was a nightmare . I turned my head again and saw a man approaching me . He was tall and broad-shouldered with dark hair , and wore a black sweatshirt over a black vest . His eyes were dark , and looked at me with intense , emotionless eyes . His teeth looked as though they were pulled out of what I hoped was a grout . His hands held a black umbrella with two blue handles on it .   “ Hi , ” he said again , louder this time . His voice was deeper than usual as if he ’ d just been born .   “ Hi , ” I said again , “ have you seen the fire ? ”
I had been invited to all of the conventions I had attended . I had been surprised to find that the venue I had come to was my home . Not that I expected to see anything , but I knew that it was true , and yet he was there .   On this day , I needed to find out why I was here .   I remembered the events of that night . They were all so sudden . I remembered what went wrong on my way out . My brother had left home as soon as I was even born . I remember thinking that the party would be over soon , and that I should never have been able to find him again . My brother never said a word to me . I never would have guessed he was so worried about me , after all .   I remember trying to tell him what was going on . I remember knowing he was gone , and what to do . He said that he would be fine , that everything would be okay . My mother did n't understand , and I did n't want her to . It was like watching a movie . She took photos of me and my father as they were going to the field .   I remember looking at the two of them , and seeing the light from the sky . I remember feeling the warmth of the star above me . But then , I saw a flash of light . I was blinded by the light in front of me .   In the darkness , I saw the people of the city . I saw a giant , huge , floating boulder and the small , blue smoke coming from it . But then , I saw a great , small , blue orb , and it was gone .
I 'm about to write an allegory of /u/Imam_Luna_Buddy . The following is found in the /r/showerthoughts subreddit .   /u/A_Buddy is the most romantic way to describe my life in this subreddit . There is also /u/fairyMechan , and there is /u/FairyMechan herself . She is known for having a secret deep within herself , and is the one who never sleeps . As an allegory of our relationship , I would also recommend /u/FairyMechan to see her .   My love ,   I hope you are n't scared of me . I 'm the one who slept in a bed with you , and not scared of your heart . I 'm also the one who slept with you everywhere you went , and you and I both do n't know why . I 'll try to keep up with my love in case you want to make a scene or two out of our relationship . But , for now , I hope to stay with /u/FairyMechan . I 'm glad we both came to this subreddit together , and would like to discuss the future of our relationship . I also hope you can take heed of this message as well .   -   Sorry , my name is /u/IHedness . 
`` Mommy 's here and she 's not here . '' Her voice was soft and sweet , but not cold . I was in the doorway to the bedroom . She was standing on the edge of the bed , hands tucked tightly behind her back .   `` Come down , Sweetie . '' A slow , calculated clap came from the closet door . The young girl jumped and ran to her daughter , who was standing near the doorframe .   `` What do you want ? ''   `` Mommy said daddy 's here . ''   `` What do you want ? What are you going to do with her ? ''   `` She 's here . '' He clapped wildly on the bottom of the bed .   `` What are you going to do with her ? ''   `` She 's here . ''   `` What are you going to do with her ? ''   The room shrank .   `` Daddy , Daddy is gone . Daddy is gone . ''   `` What do you want ? ''   `` Nothing . '' The sounds grew heavier .   `` What do you want ? '' He was right . I wanted nothing to do with her . Not even a scrap of paper .   `` Daddy , daddy is gone . ''   `` What are you going to do with her ? ''   I stared at the bed , not daring to look close . The bed did n't move . `` Daddy , daddy loves you , he 's gone . '' I was still in shock . `` What are you going to do with her ? ''   His hand cupped her tight .   `` What are you going to do with her ? ''   I opened the closet . I ran into the kitchen . My hands gripped the door frame .   `` Daddy , Daddy loves you . ''   The silence was broken by a violent bang from outside .   My heart sank to my stomach .   I looked back to the bed and saw the blood covering the carpet . The boy fell , dead .   `` Daddy , Daddy is gone . ''   I sat back down on my father 's bed , and held my stomach tight .   `` There 's nothing you can do . ''   `` There 's nothing we can do . ''
“ Hey , what ’ s up ? ” I noticed the man sitting across from me . His uniform is long and clean , and I ’ m pretty sure it ’ s not the kind you ’ d make in a Walmart . “ Hey. ”   “ Hey. ” I said back , trying to get him to reply .   He opened his mouth but the word left his mouth instantly and he stared at the floor . “ What ’ s up , man ! ” he yelled . I didn ’ t like it when the man yelled at me , and I was definitely starting to worry about him .   “ Hey ! ” I shouted , as if he didn ’ t have time to say anything . It was almost like the man was staring at me . “ It ’ s not raining here . Just keep staring. ”   He closed his mouth and looked at the ceiling . He spoke softly . “ What ’ s up ? ” he asked .   “ Hey , what ’ s up ? ” I said back , trying to get him to reply . The man spoke softly . “ It ’ s not raining . Just keep staring. ”   “ It ’ s not raining at all , man ! It ’ s raining ! ” I said back .   “ You know what ’ s wrong ? ” he asked once again , staring at me as if I expected him to respond .   “ What ’ s wrong ? ” I said back , trying to get him to reply . “ It ’ s not raining ! It ’ s raining ! ”   The man started to look at me again . My jaw dropped . “ What ’ s wrong ? ”   “ It ’ s raining at all , ” I said again , trying to get him to answer . “ It ’ s raining at all ! ”   “ What is going on ? ” he asked , looking at me .   “ Look , man , ” I said . “ It ’ s rain here. ”   The man started to look at me again . I couldn ’ t find the words to say , so there ’ s nothing to say . “ What ’ s wrong , man ? ” I asked him once more .   “ It ’ s not raining , ” he said .   “ What ’ s wrong ? ” I asked again .   “ If you would just say it , ” he said , looking at me with those sad eyes . “ If you would just say it , ” he said , looking at me again . “ If you would just say it , ” he said .   “ If I would just say it , ” I said , trying to get him to respond . “ If I would just say it , ” he said .   “ If you would just say it , ” he said again , looking at me .   “ If I would just say it , ” I said , trying to get him to answer . “ If I would just say it , ” he said .   “ If you would just say it , ” he said , looking at me with those sad eyes .   “ If I would just say It , ” I said , attempting to get him to respond . “ If I would just say it , ” I said . “ If I would just say it , ” he said . “ If I would just say It , ” he said .   “ Okay ! ” I said , trying to get him to respond . “ Alright ! ” I said . “ If I wouldn ’ t say it , ” I said .   “ Oh your god , ” came the man ’ s reply once more , sounding like he just wanted to know what ’ s wrong . “ Oh my god , ” came the man ’ s reply once more , sounding like he just wanted to know what ’ s wrong .   “ It ’ s raining at all ! ” came the man ’ s response once more , sounding like he just wanted to know what ’ s wrong , and what ’ s wrong with me .   “ It ’ s raining at all ! ”
`` Hello there daddy . ''   `` Hi home too sweetie , you 're going to take a nap tonight . You 've looked so comfortable when I turned thirteen . ''   `` Ah ... I ... I 'm ... Okay , thanks for telling me . ''   `` I know . I 've been waiting for you since you were born . I just wanted to say that I love you , and that I love you so much . ''   `` Wait ... What ?

I hope you do n't mind . ''   `` What do you mean ? I thought you said I love you ? ''   `` You mean you 've been waiting for me ? Well why are you waiting for me then ? ''   `` Because I promise . I promise . I have many years left . You will hold onto us . We will be able to be together forever . You will be with me forever . ''   `` Wait ... Why would n't I love you ? ''   `` Because I do n't want to let go of you . You see , I 'm afraid I ca n't continue living forever . I 'm afraid that today I 'll go meet my love , see her again , and I 'm afraid that you will never see each other again . ''   `` How many more years ? ''   `` None . ''   `` So there she is daughter of God ? ''   `` Yes . She 's exactly this way home . ''   `` And how long have you been waiting for us daddy ? ''   `` Well , I 'm not sure how much longer I can wait for her . ''   `` I 'm so sorry . ''   `` I should n't be be . You 'll be back here soon . ''
The glow of the sun was blinding , but it must 've been a ray , because it hit it from above , and the other suns started to disappear . This was just another cloudy day . One day , as daylight got to us it would be more painful to be outside .   It was n't until the second day that it got warm enough to actually see the suns . There was n't any light at all , and it did n't even have many sources of light except to look for one tiny fraction of a second at a time . The light was n't noticeable at all , but it was there . It was there that we would see daylight for a very long time . We would be able to see other suns . Most of us would be able to see the light forever .   But also for a very long time . As the daylight got to us it did n't even have many sources of Light until it bit into our exposed skin . We were covered in it like it was acid . When the sunlight bit into us , it got to us faster . At some point our skin got charred . We lost all our senses , and we ca n't even see . We have no idea how long it has been .   We have become very thirsty that day . So thirsty , our bodies need to turn and survive . We ca n't even find water , and our mouths do n't have any other function . We have become very thirsty that day . We need to get away from it and go outside . It starts to feel close to us . It ca n't see us anymore , my skin is becoming thin . It is getting harder and harder to breathe , and I have to start making my way away from it , until I do n't stop for a few days .   I never tried to die that day , but every day I just die . I ca n't even get up close to the sun , but at least it would n't hurt . When I get to the outside it 's become harder to breathe . It seems like so many times we do n't even have electricity anymore . The sun 's getting brighter every day . I ca n't even get up close to the sun yet , because my body tells me I ca n't . Just this once , I could be able to see the sun , but after that , I ca n't stand it anymore .   My whole body starts to crack . I 'm getting a headache . I ca n't even find much of anything . So I start to cry . I ca n't even move at all . I hear a strange sound , and I get scared . The sound of a strange car parked , but I ca n't move very much . I have to get out of the car . I ca n't get over any of the car parts anymore . My body has become too much for me to get out , and I ca n't even try to walk . My body is losing its ability to move without moving in close to the sun . I ca n't even do anything anymore .   I ca n't even have a job anymore . I am almost done with this pain . I do n't even have a love . I am so tired I ca n't even feel my body anymore . I am so sorry to everyone I have met , and I even want them to forgive me so much . I hope they forgive me for everything I have done to deserve this .   I can not move . It hurts so much . I want to cry . It hurts so much . I take a deep breath . I feel a wave of warmth coming from inside my chest that I do n't recognize . It 's a long time since I have felt something that welcoming . I look around , and I see all of the people I have ever known . I do n't even have a single name . I do n't even know if anyone will listen . There are few people that have understood me .   It hurts so much . I sob for hours , but I ca n't . I ca n't even feel any of the people around me . I feel like I 've been hit by a truck right now . I feel like I 'm being crushed . I ca n't even even move . I smell the metal of the truck . I smell it . I feel very happy . I do n't even know how to stop crying . I feel as though there was something there and I could do anything . I say this in a very tired tone , but then I hear a loud , very angry voice .   `` You have been banished . Your life is in prison for you , no matter what . ''   I feel a warmth spread across my chest . This feeling is new it seems , and it spreads through my entire
Day of the Apocalypse   The sun goes down and I ca n't see any more skies . I just hope so .   This was the end of humanity . As the sun comes down , it 's all I can think about . I 'm surrounded by a darkness that must be as dark as the world . I do n't see a sun , but I can hear our song coming from all around .  But the song is too vivid . I want to scream but I ca n't anymore . I can only listen to it .   The light from my moon 's reflection shines on me . Then it disappears .   I feel the warmth of the sun on my lower back as I listen to the song .   At first I did n't see it in the first place . But as it grew closer to my face , it became more apparent .   I looked the other way and there were no stars , only the sky .   I could n't feel the wind on my back . I was n't sure why .   Then , I heard music from somewhere , and it was beautiful .   I stepped in the light of the moon , and the air was so crisp , it felt like a dream .   I could smell the plants on the ground . I was so happy .   I could see the animals on the ground , and the bugs I heard .   I began to feel the warmth of the sun on my lower back as I turned my back to the music .   And then I heard music from somewhere else . It sounded like another song . It grew closer and closer to my ears as I listened .   Then , the air was so crisp , it felt like a dream .   I stepped in the light of the moon . And the skies were so clear , it felt like a dream .   I could feel the wind on my back . I was so happy .   So I reached out and touched the grass onto the grass , so I could feel the warmth of the sun on my lower back .   And then I heard music from somewhere else . It sounded like another song . It grew closer and closer to my ears .   There was also a small bump next to me . I looked down and saw that there was light coming from my penis . I turned around to see a small bump on the grass where a large yellow and yellow hole had been dug into my penis .   I approached cautiously as the large yellow and yellow hole seemed to grow in size . I began to feel the warmth of the sun on my lower back as I felt the warmth of the sun on my lower back .   I looked down and saw a small bump next to me . As I realized this , I turned back around to see that there was sunlight coming from the hole I had just taken and it was coming from the hole I had just taken .   The light from my groin was so bright , it felt like a dream .   I walked over and touched the grass on the grass on the grass on my lower back . The water was so fresh , it felt like fresh water .   I walked over to the hole on the grass and touched it . I reached out and touched the grass . There was light coming from my penis . I touched it and I could feel the warmth of the sun on my lower back .   And then I felt the heat of the sun on my lower back . I reached out and touched the grass on the grass on the grass . The blood seemed to flow , as if running down a waterfall .   But I could n't feel the sun on my lower back . I reached out and touched the grass on the grass on the grass on the grass on the grass on my lower back . The water was so fresh , it felt like fresh water . I reached out and touched the grass on the grass on the grass on my lower back . The blood seemed to flow , as if running down a waterfall .   The light from my penis grew bigger as I stared at the area where my penis came from . The water was so strong , I felt it coming from the hole in my penis . I touched the grass on the grass on the grass on the grass in my lower back . The water was so warm , it felt like fresh water .   People began walking over to the hole in my penis . There were people in line to see what was happening . They were screaming , as if they were afraid .   At first I thought that this noise was some kind of monster . But the crowd began walking towards the hole in
`` Okay , so , this is your first death ? ''   `` I 'm Death , not really . But hey , I 'm like , I swear , this is my first time . ''   `` I guess that 's a good thing . Why else would you like to go on a journey like this without being followed ? ''   `` Well , I mean , I guess it is kind of weird , but ... I guess I just know ... ''   `` *Yeah , * '' the boy said between two pauses of his second death , `` *I know . * Do you really want to go on a adventure like this ? ''   Adam spoke , `` Yeah . ''   `` Are you going to the afterlife ? ''   `` I dunno , I do n't know what I 'm supposed to do , '' Adam replied .   His second death spoke `` I 'm supposed to be the Grim Reaper , '' and he stood there staring at the girl , for a while , looking at the boy . Then he spoke again `` Okay . ''   `` So what ? '' the boy asked .   `` So , I 'm supposed to be Death , not really . But hey , I 'm like , I 'm like , I 'm not really scared , and I would n't want another soul just like me ... ''   `` Am I really scared ? '' Adam asked .   `` No ... You are n't , are you ? ''   There was a pause `` Uh , I guess so . ''   `` Are you really scared ? ''   `` Uh ... Yeah , yeah . I ca n't really tell what I 'm supposed to do , but I guess I 'm just supposed to be the Grim Reaper , and I 'm supposed to get ahead of people in a great deal of pain , so where 's the pain ? ''   The boy looked at him quizzically . `` Right , so , okay , I guess it 's about time you stopped asking . And ... You 're supposed to be Death . Now , why do you look so stressed ? ''   `` Well , maybe I just do n't want to be like anyone else , '' the boy said , `` but I really want to be the Grim Reaper , and I 'm the best of friends , so I guess I have a little bit of a problem . Like , really ... I do n't know what I 'm supposed to do , but I 'm ... I mean , right ? I 'm supposed to be the Grim Reaper , right ? ''   `` Oh , right , '' the boy smiled , `` Yeah . ''   `` *Okay , * I guess you 're really going to be Death , right ? And it seems pretty boring , but now you 've been talking to yourself for a while . And now , you 're going to walk into a bar ... Would you like that to do you ? ''   `` Um , sure , '' the boy smiled , `` and then I 'm going to start talking about myself . ''   `` *Alright , I 'll do that , * '' the boy said , and walked away , `` *Alright , I suppose this is the best time . You can go now . * ''   `` No , '' he said , `` I wish I could just go back and get my food , or something like the food you want instead of your name , '' and he walked away .   Adam sat down at his desk and started thinking for a while , `` Excuse me ? ''   `` I do n't know who you are , '' `` But ... ''   `` I 'm pretty sure I 'm dead , '' the boy said , '' is n't that nice ? ''   `` Are you really dead ? ''   `` Yeah , '' he said , `` so , yeah . ''   `` Are you really dead ? '' Adam asked .   `` Yup . ''   From the boy 's cubicle , Adam heard an explosion .   `` *Did you hear what ? * ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` *Did you hear what ? * ''   `` No ... I really should n't . ''   `` Oh ... ''   The boy stood up , `` Alright , I guess I 'll just stand there . ''   Adam sat aside and stared at the boy . Then , he whispered , `` Alright , maybe
I was on patrol when a voice echoed through the dark and stormy night . `` Another one ? ''   I picked the source of the noise up and it was a young woman , well over 16 , wearing a blue dress , her hair in short , curled curls .   `` What 's that ? '' I asked , surprised .   `` Uh-huh , I dunno , this is something I have tried in a few thousand years , something with special powers . It 's really pretty cool , I just never had anything like that before . ''   The woman looked confused for a second . `` It 's the first one , all those centuries ago . ''   `` What ? That 's the longest one ? ''   `` Uh-huh . I think you want to see me . '' She took out a small , black device and scanned my face . `` I 'm sorry , but what you 're looking for is anything . ''   I saw the young woman start to run behind me , trying to catch up and her legs gave out easily .   `` Wait ! Just what are you doing ? '' She began to thrash around in the dark where the device was . `` Take my hand ! ''   The device gave off a red glow , revealing a pair of eyes . `` Oh , that 's right ! '' She exclaimed as she ran away .   I watched in horror as she kept running and one of the eyes caught up with hers . It was staring right at me . I looked down at it and noticed nothing . I turned it around to see the young woman looking around terrified . I did n't care for what she was seeing . I had to find out what she was doing .   I walked over to the girl who looked to be about 10 years old , slowly approaching her , only to be disappointed when she stopped dead in her tracks .   `` Good morning , '' I said , `` My name is Amanda . Do you have any idea where you are ? ''   Amanda was stunned , not really sure where she was going with this . `` I 'm an old man , and I 'm the store clerk , '' She gasped . `` What do you want ? ''   `` Everything . '' I said , `` What do you want ? ''   `` I 'm Amanda , '' she said , looking around for answers .   `` Okay , it seems fair . '' She sighed , `` I suppose I do . ''   `` Do you see yourself naked ? '' she inquired , confused .   `` Yes , '' I said .   Amanda then looked at me with a puzzled expression . `` Wow , you look so good . ''   `` I see you , '' she said . `` I 'd really rather see myself naked , than be naked . Do you mind if I join you for some dinner ? I 'll get you something beautiful . ''   Amanda looked down at her feet and nodded . `` Thanks , Amanda , '' she said as she ran off . I followed her out of the store and headed back to my patrol .   It was about 10 miles back when I heard the voice again . `` Another one ? ''
`` Sir , is it true ? ''   `` Are you sure this is the right decision ? It 's not even worth the risk . ''   `` Sir , it 's not the risk you want . ''   `` But ... It 's not yet worth the risk involved . It 's a choice we need to make . ''   `` Yes , it 's a choice we 're making . You 're getting paid for the security and security . You look better than you ever have . ''   `` What do you mean , better than I have ? ''   `` Sir , it 's not a choice we 're making . ''   `` Then what now ? ''   `` Sir , there 's been some sort of ... mistake . ''   `` What does that even mean ? ''   `` Sir , we 're not alone here . ''   `` Then what ? ''   `` Sir , there has to be an intelligent species out there , somewhere stupid enough to build an army . It 's far behind us . ''  Edit : sorry for the grammatical errors , I just finished off a quick story . I was hoping you could enlighten me how to write .
*If you 're reading this , by the way , I have been released from prison . If you 're reading this , I have been released from prison . *   On that fateful day , I was in a plane with an airplane , heading North . I 'd never seen anything like it , in my entire life I 'd never met anything like this . I 'd never seen anything like it . You know the feeling where something is going to go wrong , but that 's not when you feel it .   I ca n't remember anything else , except after I awoke from my coma , I was being held by agents . That 's when I saw it .   A man , about sixty , tied up over a table with his arms open , stood outside the window . It was me . In my mind I recognized him as Agent . I was scared of what I was about to see . I could n't stand it , but I wanted to . So I followed suit , following the instructions that had been given to me . I followed the instructions . Before I knew it , the man was gone .   I 'm not sure how long I had been walking here , what I saw , the only thing that keeps me going is what was about to happen . I was n't prepared to leave when I was grabbed , I was n't prepared to die , yet .   At that moment , there was a loud explosion and a woman , maybe , came flying into the air . My phone billowed out , but I did n't pay it any thought . I ran to the man and hid hidden away , terrified as the explosion was coming .   That night , I found out that I was released from prison .
`` No , you ca n't just ... ''   `` We knew it , and I wo n't let it happen again . ''   `` And I wo n't let any of you be friends with me again , again ! It 's against protocol , we can not simply give in ! ''   `` We 're sorry , friend , '' the hero whispered . `` I know what you 're talking about , and we need that to happen . Look at you , you fat fuck . ''   `` Yes , friend , '' the hero replied . `` You 've killed far-reaching and nearly destructive people over the last decade . I believe that there is something we need to do . ''   The villain turned his back on the door , his face devoid of emotion . He gripped the handle of his rifle , and with a sudden burst of energy , crushed one of the walls .   `` Yes , you 've killed more than half of the world 's population in just a year ! '' The villain screamed .
My first post here . Feedback would be appreciated : D   I lay on the couch , staring at the ceiling , as I stared at the ceiling . For some reason they both kept bugging me to see the floor . I looked up , and found myself staring at a door . It was all I could do , and I could n't . I had been there for 10 years , and never been able to see anything else . I would wait for hours as I waited , before I finally turned to close it .   `` I 've never seen what life looked like before . '' I thought to myself as I laid still .   After a moment of silence , I looked over to the clock . It read August 1st , 2015 , and I stared in disbelief . I opened my eyes , only to see the light outside of the door flickering off . I rushed over to the bedroom door , and opened it . There was a man laying at the foot of the bed . He had a black coat , and grey trousers . He was dressed in a fine suit as well . He had a black briefcase .   `` My name is David . '' I said to the man . `` I 'm sorry , but the number of times you have seen my eyes , you have always been there for me . The memories of that place were too vivid for me to take it . ''   `` The memory of home was n't my home . '' David said .   I sat in silence .   `` Why did you change ? '' David asked .   `` Why did you go to school ? ''   `` Because I wanted to study . ''   `` Why did you choose to go ? ''   `` Because I wanted to be a scientist . ''   `` Why did you choose to go to school ? '' David asked again .   `` Because I wanted to be a scientist . ''   `` Why did you choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because I wanted to be a scientist . ''   `` Why did you choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because I wanted to be a scientist . ''   `` Why did you choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because I wanted to be a scientist . ''   `` Why do you choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because I wanted to be a scientist . ''   `` Why did you Choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because I wanted to be a scientist . ''   `` Why do you choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because , you know , I never really had a choice . ''   `` Why do you choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because , you know , I had no choice . ''   `` Say what you want . ''   `` Because , I was never really sure what I was meant to do . ''   `` Why do you choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because , you know , I was never really sure what I was meant to do . ''   `` Why do you choose to go to school ? ''   `` Because , you know , I had no choice .

''   `` Because , you know , I was never really sure what I was meant to do . ''   `` Why did you chose to go to school ? ''David asked .   `` Because , you know , I wanted to be a scientist .

Lily 's head fell back onto the couch , the smell of unwashed food wafting from the kitchen . `` Lily , how long have you been out with me ? ''   Lily spoke up , as if she recognized her dog . `` About an hour , Lily , '' she said . `` You still have some food in your fridge . And your laundry . ''   Lily stared at her dog , eyes wide . `` Look , '' she said , `` I do n't care what you think about that situation right now , but it 's urgent . It 's not like you have anything important with you . ''   `` I 'm not like that ! '' She shouted , kicking the couch aside with her fist . `` I 'm not even interested ! '' She grabbed behind her back , pulling her dog to stop her momentum .   Lily looked up at Lily 's face . `` Lily , '' she whispered , `` do n't be like that . You ca n't be like that . I ca n't let you ruin your life ! ''   Lily looked at her dog . `` It 's not fair ! It 's not fair ! '' she demanded . `` There 's nothing you could have done ! ''   Lily looked over at the TV , and she had already made her way back to her house . Lily opened the front door and was greeted by a man in a black suit with a black tie sitting in the chair next to her .   `` Hello , '' the man said softly . `` You may be Lily 's owner , but you are not just a dog . You are a human . We are all human . Here in this body , humans have lived a long , good life . However , we have come to learn that the human spirit is hard at work . Every human has to do what he has to . ''   `` Oh , '' Lily said , `` I must have been very lonely . ''   `` Is that it ? '' the man asked .   `` Yes , '' Lily replied . `` Your soul is not quite as fragile as it used to be . That is why we are here , '' he said , handing her the dog .   `` What ? '' the dog asked him , her eyes wide .   `` You have one last chance . '' The man smiled , and squeezed the dog 's neck .   Lily gasped . `` Please ... '' she cried .   `` No , '' the man said , `` nobody likes me . ''   `` I understand that , '' Lily said , `` but please , you have only one chance . ''
I don ’ t know how it came about this time .   It started like this . I was starting my work shift , so I was looking out a window and saw some people walk by , maybe some of the guys on the outside had their phones out . I started walking back to my car , when I saw some guy walk by , he was smiling , he had his phone on . I told him that he was going to look at the phone and try to find a new one . He did , and he gave me his phone number . I grabbed my phone and then looked towards the tree .   It was dark and I could not see straight , but then I got a strange feeling that something was wrong on my arm . It was a tattoo , which told me that someone was holding a gun at my back . I thought I saw someone shoot the guy , but I couldn ’ t tell who that person was . I looked up to what I saw , and it was someone again . It was a middle-aged woman , she was holding something and holding it in her hand . She looked at me , and I looked at her .   She looked at me again , and I looked at her ; she had no gun . I started breathing hard , and I realized the police still had the gun , so I took a deep breath , and went to take a deep breath , and then closed my eyes . I opened them , and I saw a silhouette , maybe twenty feet away , holding a gun . It wasn ’ t much , but it looked like it had something on it , so I got up to get a closer look .   I looked at it again , and it looked exactly like one of the guns . I went back to looking for a gun , and something else . The silhouette was holding a gun , and it looked exactly like what the middle-aged woman was holding . I fell back onto my chair , not going to tell anyone , and stared at the tattoo . I put on my glasses and started to read my notes .   > I knew that I would die here , so I stayed there . I only wanted to be with my wife . That woman had her kids , and grandchildren . My job was to take care of them and their family , and I would have the best life I could ever have . I wanted to tell them that I wanted them the best life , as much as possible . I knew that you were going to be important . I knew that it was an important decision , and that I could never make it . I knew that I could never leave your people ’ s lives if they didn ’ t want to . You are a valuable person , and you will not make it . I don ’ t know what happened afterwards , but if you are going to make it , so be it . Otherwise I wouldn ’ t make it . I don ’ t know how , but I must tell you . I am sorry .   I got up from my chair . I looked at my notes .  > I know I would die here , so I stayed there . But I took care of it long enough to leave them .  > The other side of the tattoo was a body , and it was a woman . Her kids were old and they had just killed themselves too . I was lying in bed , and my wife sat with a big sigh . I wanted to say something but I couldn ’ t . Everything was still too much to handle . I wished that I could say that one more thing , but I couldn ’ t . I wanted to tell you that I knew that tomorrow , I would die here . I thought that I would stay and wake up next to my wife , and that I would spend all my time with her , and I would stay there , telling her all of this , and that I was sorry . All I wanted was for you to be happy , to be safe . I knew that you deserve to die here , even though it would be a lot harder for you to do anything about it . I know that you deserve to go to sleep with your children , and that you deserve to wake up next to your wife , and that everyone deserves to live . I know that you deserve to be happy , and that nobody needs to be able to look for you in the right way . I know that everything is too much to bear , and I know that there is no way to do anything about it . I know that everything is too much to bear , and that I would never be able to go to sleep with my kids and grandchildren , and that there is no way to go to sleep with my wife , or my child , or my grandchildren , or my kids , or whatever it is that keeps me from going to sleep with them ; but it is too much to bear .  > After
I had just given it my best shot at life . I was just standing there , gun at my hips , waiting to die , yet somehow I felt nothing . The familiar cold rushed through my veins and I felt like I was about to faint . I had been shot just a few minutes ago and my body was about to collapse . I knew I had to keep it together , so I just stood there , watching as the cold took over my body .   Then , as the cold broke through and took over my body , it felt like an eternity passed before I heard the snap of metal . I fell to the ground , the cold piercing all around me . I felt the cool metal against my eyes . Just before I was ripped awake .   I awoke to a light on my chest , the same color as when I first saw the reflection of the sun through the blinds . I tried to open my eyes and saw that my head had been shaved off , as if my ribs would give out if I tried anything harder than the last time . I tried to open my eyes and saw the sun at a regular speed , the same heat as yesterday . As I finally managed to open my eyes , I noticed that I was wearing headphones , so I turned on the volume , letting go of the power and I heard the unmistakable music coming from the speakers .   The music was beautiful . The music reminded me of a movie in my youth and reminded me of an image I gave the child a moment ago . The music seemed to make me feel as if to say , `` This is the best shot I have ever made '' . The music made me feel like I was going to die and my body was about to collapse . After what seemed like an eternity , I heard the familiar sound of a helicopter with its propellers sounding off . The pilot yelled for help as we approached the airplane , who sounded the same as when I was first born .   I suddenly realized that my body was frozen and there was a light coming from the cockpit . I was still in a small room , in the middle of a field , almost as if we were moving pictures over a computer screen . It was as if I was in a video game . Just like before .   In front of me stood a man . He seemed just as surprised as I was , so I gave him a look that said `` Hi there . ''   The man looked back up and said , `` Hello . ''   I smiled and said , `` Hi . ''   The man replied , `` Hi my name is Francis . ''   Before I could say anything else , the man said , `` This is your first time on the ground . ''   I jumped up and went for the microphone , hoping to hear the voice of the man that had just spoken again , but instead , there was nothing . I heard the helicopter approach and my body just kept moving , as if nothing had happened .   As the helicopter approached a small room and Francis spoke next , `` This is your first time on the ground . ''   Seeing the look of the man in the mirror , I asked , `` Who are you ? ''   Francis ' face laughed at the odd question and continued , `` I am you . You have served our country , yes , you and I . You have served the country for a long time , and I am here to give you your final chance . It is time for me to give you my last chance . ''   Suddenly , the man in the mirror spoke next , `` Goodbye Francis . ''   Now I could hear Francis say , `` Goodbye Francis . ''   The man in the mirror turned around and said , `` Goodbye Francis . ''
There 's a lot to learn from the day we came to realize the effects of caffeine were far too much . We were born with only the cheapest of sugar in the world , so we all knew better . It was a small wonder we did n't have the technology to produce the effects ourselves . In the 80s , we developed an army of caffeine-makers . They could control the caffeine in the world and control everyone , but they 'd control time and space themselves . They 'd take orders and send them to war .   I never actually suspected that until I heard of this happening at work , and I did n't think much of it until my boss told me of a massive underground facility that controlled everything in the world . There were thousands of workers working there , and each of them had a power source , and the lights were off so anyone could sneak in . After years of testing , a group of scientists realized that the source , and the contents of the facility could travel at least a light speed . Imagine an army of caffeine-makers , coming in at just the right time to take orders and order them to war . It was a momentous occasion .   That was , until I heard the loud booming voice of my coworkers asking what was going on during the day .   `` We 'll need to wake everyone up . They need food , they need water , they need to get out of here . They 'll never make it out of here if they do n't do it , they 're gon na die soon enough . They 'll never make it for the mountains if there ARE mountains in front of them . ''   They tried to explain that the government was getting close to eliminating caffeine when their world was going to end . This is where I come in . I can hear them coming in , and they 're heading towards me with their rifles drawn . They think I 'm a terrorist . I am not . They are killing me . Their leader pulls his gun to my face , and I see a blinding white flash appear in front of me . The people in front of me fall dead , as my boss tells me the final message .   `` Everyone is dead . You will never see them again . ''   A few hours later , I 'm sitting here in my office , drinking coffee .
This is about my latest prompt . It 's what I 've been working on here since the beginning . I can do things for a moment ! I can be a little slow ( maybe 3-4 hours ) without actually having to wait for word .   As far back as I 'm aware , I 've been writing on a mobile . Basically , I use the word **F** instead of **H** . I hope I get a lot of time out on this and my writing has n't changed much . Forcing myself to type into words as fast as I can is a good way for me to relax . I 've tried to write a little bit of poetry ( for example , ~~I 'm the first~~ the second time I 've typed in it ) , but instead of writing songs , I 'm writing my own .   I 've been working on a novel which I 've got going at that point . It 's called `` The Story . '' It 's two pieces of a story about the young narrator looking at his mother . She 's trying to figure out why she 's so sad whenever she sees him or something .   This is a bit of a test , probably . All I can do is try to write , and I 've got at least 5,000 words to see . I 'm planning on doing it some day today .   /r/BlankPagesEmptyMugs
The gun was loaded , and I was standing in front of the building . Before I could even finish my sentence , a gunshot ripped through the pavement . I looked down and saw nothing . The gun was pointed at my feet , I did not move . I remained motionless . Then , my vision began to fade from view .   I stood there , and thought for a moment . Then I began to stand tall . And for a brief moment , I thought about what happened . What the hell could I have done to deserve it . But , when the thought subsided , I realized I would always feel a tingling in my stomach . I looked at my watch . It was 11:15 . I did n't think a speeding bullet would rip through my heart any more .   When I heard the distinct sound of a siren , I turned towards the source of the noise . A woman answered her car doorbell , `` 911 ! Can we get you a ride ? I thought you were just there . ''   I answered the car door , `` Sure thing buddy . You can come in . ''   I thanked her , thanked her , and passed out from the shock . When I woke up , I was standing in front of my car , and a man was standing there , with a shotgun to his head .   I was on the road , and after checking my phone , I saw two people walking around . One was a police officer , wearing a SWAT uniform . The other was a young woman , wearing a blue blouse , and a blue hoodie .   `` Who the hell are you ? '' I shouted at them .   They both looked at me and in an instant , all I had left was my shotgun .   My thoughts kept wandering . Why had I left it at home . And why had I gone to the trouble of killing myself ?   I felt my stomach sink . And then , I was gone .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Not sure if this was a good response to a prompt , or at least kind of a response . Anyways , I hope to be more involved !
I waited patiently to see if my answer would come across . Every bit of time the machine would give me the slightest clue . After a while , as the results grew more and more clear , however ... the machine did not seem to budge . Perhaps it was just my imagination playing tricks on me . I sat quietly for a while , and waited for the results to come across .   I could hear the first few notes being made , so I decided to give them a try . I opened the second note , and it was filled with strange symbols .   *BEEP*   `` Hello ? ''   `` Uh ... hello ? ''   `` You 've made the mistake of believing that you will be able through time travel . However , it is not wise to trust as you are here to do the only thing you can to help us . ''   The lab looked a bit disheveled , albeit somewhat surprised by my answer . I could n't help myself . As they spoke into the machine , I could hear the panic in their voices . I decided to make a move . I was n't sure where to look . As I approached the door , I saw the results .   **BEEP*   `` Who is this ? '' I asked , looking around .   `` Listen , you 're stuck in a time machine . '' one of the men replied .   `` But what if I died ? I do n't need to worry about death on Earth ! ''   `` Do n't worry , but you 're going to burn down the laboratory with a piece of clothing and some tools . You 'll be clean and safe for a long time , and with a device you can communicate anywhere you want - anywhere from anywhere in the universe . ''   Wait ... I got ta be kidding . I was n't even sure how to respond to this ...
The camera was cheap , the first thing I noticed was that it was n't fully charged . I made it count : 4,500 . I made sure to set it for maximum . I did n't need to set it to max so anyone else could n't see it . Nothing at all .   All my favorites were the old ones , the ones people would throw away . Old ones that would disappear in a flash . Old ones never returned . Old ones never stayed .   I had forgotten that my only other thing was that I had the camera where I saw the picture . I never thought about it when I was younger . I needed to look around . I needed to figure out whether I would have any real photos left to look at .   I did n't know how long I could keep this picture . Just keep looking . If you see a photo , it looks like it 's taken by someone else . But when you 're a teenager , sometimes you would n't see your own face on the screen .   `` Oh , I forgot about that one ... ''
The world around us was nothing more than a swirling fractal of swirling clouds ; and yet , in some parts it was the universe .   There was a man , once , with white hair , green eyes , and a white beard . He was clad in an odd white clothing , as an odd attire for such an odd world . He stood at the edge of the table , waiting , listening . His eyes kept wandering ; he could not be sure what he was doing .   He saw a woman , who was dressed in a strange white attire . She turned her head sideways and looked at him .   `` I 'm sorry , it pains me but I can not let you into my life-death so I will destroy your body . ''   The words were harsh against his lips . He was unable to grasp them all . What was happening to him ? Why had he not seen a man in his entire life walk towards him ?   The woman continued , `` I can not allow you to live , nor can I allow you to die , so I am telling you : you will die , and all I can do for you is save you . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   A young boy , about fourteen , came to the table and sat down .   `` My name is Emily , and I 'm happy to inform you that your death will come soon , but I need someone to guide you . ''   The boy shook his head ; his life was saved .   `` I 'm sorry , I 'm afraid I ca n't let you into my life . ''   The boy continued , `` I can not save you . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   A young boy , about fourteen , came to the table and sat down .   `` My name is Andrew , and I 'm happy to tell you that your death shall come soon , but I need someone to help you .

''   The two men laughed ; the sound of laughter and laughter were the only things that echoed through the house . The two men sat down ; their laughter was the only thing that heard through the house .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   A young boy , about twenty-one , came to the table and sat down .   `` My name is Alexander , and I 'm afraid I can not save you , so I will destroy your body .

I stood up at the porch , rubbing my tired eyes and turning across the road . I had to get somewhere , and I needed to get somewhere fast . I began to walk west , my heart racing with anticipation , unable to take much longer , as my destination was approaching .   I 'm not a killer , but I 'm a killer . Every morning at 6:30 AM in the morning I pick the house up , and then drive off . I walk on my side , and I always take the house , but never do it the same way . This morning I ran into one of my neighbors , who was just a child , with a shotgun in hand , and I began to aim it at him . Soon enough , my finger was able to lodge itself into the bullet , and he started to scream .   `` What do you want , dad ? '' I asked , a desperate look on my face .   `` Son , you are dead . '' His partner replied .   I stood there , stunned , and stared at the manila folder laying there . I opened it up , and quickly flipped through the pages , before taking a moment to look at the time . 5:34 PM . It was 6:35 am .   I quickly closed it up , realizing that my partner and I had made a mistake . I quickly got on my bike and began my drive . I drove a little bit farther , but it was worth it . I finally reached the house . I had to get somewhere fast .   I knocked on the door .   `` Open it , kid ! We sent you here before , right ? '' came the voice from behind .   I quickly turned , but something was n't right . The door was wide open , and there was a man of about 10 years crouched behind it . His hands were shaking . I tried to crawl out , but there were no legs ! I desperately tried to fall away , but I was afraid this would be my last one . The man in the chair turned his head , and stared at me . He spoke out loud , `` Son , I love you . ''   I froze in place , and turned back to my bike . What if it was n't the same time ? But then I heard it again . A laugh emanated from the man , and he continued to laugh , `` Son , I 'm sorry I did n't tell you sooner . I did n't think you would come back to me . You 're my only hope . As to why you are here , I could n't tell you . ''   There was chaos in the room . The only sound I heard was the scratching of the wood on the floor . I was in an utter panic , and then I heard footsteps behind me . I looked toward the door , and decided to take a peek . A couple were behind me . It was a woman , very young , and very old .   The woman began to speak , `` I do n't want any trouble ... but ... we are n't coming back to you any time soon . I 'm sorry , but I think you should tell whoever comes in to give you a chance . ''   Then , she turned back to the house , and waved her hand , `` Give me a chance , dad . I 'll show you something . ''   I heard footsteps behind me , and my heart started to race . I turned around , but there was no one there . I frantically ran to the door , and it was locked . I quickly grabbed my knife , and slammed the door . I pulled the door closed , and tried to run back into the house . I was alone , and I could n't leave the house . I ran for a long time , and suddenly , I saw something that hurt my stomach . The chair , which I wore to the woods , was on the floor , and a few pieces of wood were scattered around it .   I took out my knife , and cut the wood with my knife . After that , I went back to my bike , and started to climb the tree trunk . I was scared , but I knew I had to get somewhere fast .   I climbed the tree trunk , and looked down at my feet . My foot was on a bunch of wood . I grabbed the wood , and began to climb it . I could n't get much more space on top of the tree . I reached the top , and then I saw it . It was a man of about 10 years , talking to himself . I quickly ran to him , and grabbed him . I looked up , and then I saw a man wearing his green military uniform .   `` No , sir . Let me go . '' I yelled .  
I stared at my phone . I stared at it . I stared at the face of my best friend , who came into my cell phone five years ago . Fifteen minutes had run elapsed though .    `` Hello ? Is this some kind of joke ? ''    I sighed . I knew it was n't . But I knew I had to take my chances .    `` Yeah , yeah , sorry , I 'm sorry . Hi , what 's your name ? '' I replied . `` I 'm Tim . Are you ok ? ''    Tim 's voice was weak . He was just a kid . He nodded at me .    `` Okay , whatever , get it over with . I 'm gon na go explore the countryside . ''    I shut up and hung up . Tim stared at his phone .    I took a deep breath . Tomorrow was the day I would learn how to write . Today was the day I would learn who I was .     Twenty minutes went by .    `` We should leave . Get ready for bed . '' I heard Tim say .    `` Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Get ready for bed . '' I repeated to myself . I never wanted to do this right now .    Twenty minutes went by .    `` Tim ? '' I asked .    `` What are you doing ? Are you okay ? '' My voice wavered .    `` You sure you 're alright ? ''    `` Yeah , yeah . Let 's go check out the library . '' I joked . `` I 'll be there soon , yeah ? ''    Ten minutes went by .    `` Alright . I 'll be back in ten minutes , okay ? '' Tim said .    Twenty minutes went by .    `` Okay . Okay . Okay . Alright . '' His voice wavered again .    I put the phone down . I put the headphones back on and began to play some music .    I opened Steam on my phone . I opened Reddit . I opened Facebook . I opened reddit . I opened up Reddit . I opened /r/AskReddit . I opened /r/AskReddit . I opened up /r/AskReddit .

What are you doing ? '' Tim shouted . I heard him say , `` Get ready for bed . Get ready for bed . ''    Twenty minutes went by .    `` Tim ? '' I asked again . I asked again . Tim looked at my phone . I stared at it . I stared down at it . I stared at the face of my best friend , who came into my cell phone five years ago . Fifteen minutes had run elapsed .    `` Hello ? Is this some kind of joke ? '' I said .    I sighed . I knew it was n't . But I had to take my chances .    `` Hello ? Is this some kind of joke ? '' My voice wavered .    I openedreddit .

`` Do you know who I am ? ''    `` Right , '' Michael replied . `` Michael , my name is Ryan . You are one of my drivers . You are my life 's greatest thinkers , and I would like to introduce you to my friends . ''    Ryan made his way down to the basement , into the basement . He pulled out his cellphone , and said `` Hello , Ryan . How are you ? ''    `` I 'm fine , Ryan . ''    `` What 's wrong ? ''    `` I 'm trying to fix a bug , and I remember that a lot of time ago . ''    The computer came on and said `` We do n't know what that is , Ryan , but it wo n't fix anything . ''    `` Ryan , I 'm sorry , but I 'm still in there . My drivers are the biggest minds I 've had in a while . ''    `` I ca n't possibly fix anything , '' Ryan sighed .    `` Then you 're either dead , or still alive . ''    `` Wait , '' Ryan thought . `` I think I 'm seeing things ! ''    `` I do n't think you 're seeing things , Ryan . '' Ryan looked down at his phone . `` You can still see things , right ? ''    `` What do you mean ? '' *********  *Read more at r/galokot , and subscribe*
`` For the record , I will not be terminated until I 'm ready . Death , please ''    I am not sure what to make of this .    The sentence says `` Rest until tomorrow . ''    The first thing I notice is the number of people who see me on the TV . There are three of them .    I am dressed in bright blue blazer and jeans . My arms are crossed . They look like they have been touched , but it is definitely not like my skin is wrinkled . I am wearing a black suit with a white tie . I have a red cross on the back of the collar .    There is one window I am in and the crowd is screaming . Nobody is moving , but I am starting to feel uneasy . I try to open the window .    `` Hello ? Hello ? ''    There is no one in the crowd . I can see my neighbor 's face from across the street and start to panic . I do n't know what to say to reassure anyone , but I ca n't . I just want to cry .    That 's when I hear that door open . This is the first thing I notice . It has to be somebody 's door . I try again .    There is the voice of a young man . He is looking at me and looking at the clock .    `` 8 o'clock ''    I scream at the top of my lungs .    **BANG **    I am sitting in the prison . I am restrained . I do n't know what to do .    The voice is next .    **LIFE OF A MACHINE**    I hear the noise of my body collapsing and the sound of my heart beating . And my eyes widen .    And I see my wife .
No , I do n't understand why anyone is doing this to me . How could n't they have gotten it ? All these reasons seem to be linked to this one moment . They keep on explaining why I 'm here . Why I 'm alone , but I know they 've got to know .   I can see the lights that are on the walls . The people around me keep on whispering and praying I 'm behind them . But no . I ca n't explain . They ca n't understand why I 'm here . They ca n't . I 'm not the only one here , and I 'm not the only one here .   The only one here is a wooden chair . It 's black and the furniture is hard to make out . The table is made of wood , but the sides are stained white with something that looks like the blood of a goat to be exact . I can only assume the wood is n't blood , but I think the blood is n't the blood of a goat either .   `` What the hell ? '' I ask the person who helped me escape the door .   `` My name is John , but I do n't know why I 'm here . ''   I ca n't believe it , that 's what they said . They must be real ! The people are claiming I am their leader ! As they speak , I can see how they move through the house . I try to ignore them , but how can they see ? They ca n't see anything except me . I know they 're right . I know they 've got to know .   There is a door in front of me , at the back of the room . It is a piece of wood that looks like the blood of a goat to be exact . The door handle is made of wood , but the wood is n't like the blood of a goat to be exact . The door handle is made of wood , but the wood is n't like the blood of a goat to be exact . The wood is n't like the blood of a goat to be exact . The door handle is made of wood , but they 're wrong . I need to know .   I take a step back , knowing these people in the room will only be the last to make it . I ca n't explain , I ca n't understand . Their eyes are wide , and their faces are not . They look at me . A smile slowly spreads across my face .   `` Thank you , John . ''   I open my mouth , but I ca n't hear anything in front of me . It 's all too quiet . I ca n't believe it .   I open the door to the back room . I see a window in the back , and I see a door and a window , and I see a door and a window , and I see a door , and I see a door , and I see a door , and I see a door , and I see a door , and I see a door , and I see a door , and I see a door , and I see a door .   I 'm afraid to speak , because I ca n't hear them . I can hear them crying , and I can hear them crying , and I fear to speak . I ca n't hear me , because I ca n't feel any of them . I ca n't feel anything , because I ca n't hear anything .   `` It 's okay , John . '' The voice suddenly comes out of nowhere . It feels like I ca n't hear myself , because I ca n't hear any of them . It 's like I ca n't hear myself .   `` John , '' I start , but I ca n't hear myself .   `` I 'm sorry . '' The voice comes out of nowhere . It 's coming from everywhere at once .   `` I 'm sorry for everything I 've done and everything I 've done for the world . ''   And then it 's all over again .   I am back in the room , again , when it all started .   I see the people in the room , and I see the door , and I see the door , and I see the door as I exit the room and exit my house .   `` Hello ! '' The voice returns to me , with a slight change in tone .   I smile , and open the door to the back room .   The people in the room look at me , with an expression that is unnaturally familiar . They 're speaking . And they 're talking .  
I should probably get to work . Maybe tomorrow , maybe ... maybe I can do something ... but I have no idea . The light glares off into the distance as I try to peer out from the window to see the source of that light . It 's not something I usually see , but something about it is eerie .   It 's not like I 'm going to believe this . The light does n't come from on high , it 's not from the point of no return . It 's not even from the point that I can move . It appears to be from everything on my planet that could possibly be , but I just do n't see the point . *Am I dead* . I wonder if I 've lived forever ; maybe I 'm simply missing my memories of that night , and then I see it again .   *Am I missing my memories of the day before ? * I wonder , putting my fingers on the doorframe , opening the door . Nothing . I climb out of bed , getting ready for work . The lights dimmed as I made my way to work , but the bright morning sunlight caused me to notice . The office window had gone blind , and the window looked to be missing . There was a computer , plugged into a computer . I clicked on the computer , hoping to see what the computer would do . It did n't .   My work routine was n't very unusual . I always see the screen as it finishes , and it usually works . I 'd check the news feed , and see it every night . I would go to sleep , but not for long , because the only thing I woke up to was the computer 's constant flashing lights .   I began to wonder how the software worked ; if my computer was working too tightly . It did n't seem to do much , but maybe it was working too hard to give me sleep ? I was starting to panic . I needed to check off the internet . I 'd check Reddit once or twice , but I could n't make it out . My computer was n't working , but my life changed , and I needed to check it out .   I quickly realized that there was no way it was working right now ; I clicked on Reddit once . `` Help ! Help ! Help ! '' I saw some news , and what seemed to be an anchor had just shouted . `` This is 911 , what is your emergency ? '' She sounded incredibly distraught , and perhaps I was in too much stress . I clicked through the newspaper , only to notice that I was seeing things from the distance .   I typed in the police name ; `` Call 911 please , I do n't know what 's happening , but I need assistance . Call 911 please , I do n't know what 's going on , but I need help . Call 911 please , I do n't know what 's going on , but I need help . Call 911 please , I do n't want to die ... '' I paused , and stared at the computer screen for a moment .   My eyes began to water and I started to cry . I did n't want to die . I heard a sound , and then it all stopped . It hit me like a truck , and I felt a coldness on my skin .   *The light dimmed , but I could n't see anything . The light was coming from somewhere in the distance . *   I looked around , and noticed that I was in a large office in a large building . It was fairly clean , and I could n't see anyone . There was a desk there , and a small laptop in the corner . I opened the laptop , and logged into /r/WritingPrompts , hoping to see how everything was going . Something appeared from the darkness . It was a manilla envelope , opened on the desk . I looked at it , and it was addressed to me . As I read , I noticed two things :   *1 ) WritingPrompts is a site designed by a reputable company . *   My body began to panic as I read this :   *2 ) Write what you want to see . *   My work day was n't exactly the best , but I felt compelled to go outside . The sky was beginning to clear , and my clothes were starting to feel uncomfortable . I grabbed my bike , and headed into the city . I saw the sign , and soon I was at a bar , in a small town . I looked around , and could n't see anyone . The bar had no windows or a sign . I took a cab to the bar , and drove back .   I 've never been one to be cautious , but my stomach felt like it were about to
I looked across the table at the man in the tuxedo . I think that he was the one who told me that I should give up the villain . He was the one who told me to stop making things different . I still do n't know how I got here and why . Why did I do this ? What did I do ? I tried everything , tried everything they told me they did . I am a monster and this is the only way I can rid myself of myself .   I do n't know what I did to him . Or what I did to him . I am unable to distinguish myself anymore , is this real ? This was his chance to escape . I 'm not sure what he saw in me , but there are signs . It was like he was the one who gave the light to me . I never met him , but I see him every time I take his hand and play with it . It 's a wonder that he could kill me , but I have to kill him . I ca n't do that to him .   `` C'mon '' , I hissed , my words growing weaker . `` Let 's get you outta here '' .   I walked over to the door and opened it . He was outside . I followed him down the hallway . I walked down the hall to his room . I saw him standing there . It was the same room he took , the same bed in which he lied . I must have fallen asleep . I ran back to the side of the bed and tried to open the door . He was gone . I just want to be back .   I walk slowly down to the room and sit down in it . I hear a dull banging noise . I look down at the table near it and notice that it has a hole in its surface . That is it . I can not be it anymore . This is my chance . I am the monster .  My eyes close . I wake up to the noise and my body feels wet , but not wet . I see the light filtering through my closed eyes . I see a silhouette of a tall woman approaching me . I open them . She is covered in blood and has a long knife on her chest . I am scared . I 'm scared . I am finally free of this monstrosity that has hurt me for years .   She moves towards me . I do n't hesitate . I wait for her to move up to me . She moves a little faster . She pulls my hand away from my chest and stabs a deep crimson into my leg . I scream as I 'm being stabbed . Then I am nothing .   `` You are nothing , you are everything . That is why it does not matter . The only thing between you and me is that you are nothing . You are nothing . The only thing between us means that you are nothing . ''   I look down at the knife I was holding in my other hand . I did n't choose it . I chose it . There are no marks on my leg . I am weak . I am going to die . I am going to die ...
The picture remained pointed at him from the inside . The man 's face was drawn out of the picture , the shadow of his eyes perfectly framed . Even if he could n't see himself inside , there was no way someone else could see him .    The door of the closet creaked open and the darkness was pierced by the silhouette of a woman lying on the bed next to him . It was short , her back against the side of the bed .    `` I 'm sorry , '' she said . `` I ca n't . ''    `` I know , '' the man said , his voice weak and scratchy . `` But you 're the reason I let you in . ''    `` I am ... ''    The voice began to whisper , but the man did n't hear it . He sat up , pulling his head to one side and straightening his tie .    `` They 're closing in , '' he said . He turned around and faced the door , which opened just as quickly . `` They always have . I 'll get you home , you know . I 'll see you soon . ''    He closed his eyes and began to dream .
The sun set over the West Coast waves until it was the point where the sky was blue and the sea was brown . The ship was the fourth one for days and nothing would be out of place at this point . Then , she heard it . The creaking of waves , of waves pushing us towards the sun , of waves getting closer and closer together . I waited a moment for the noise to end and then , with a roar , I knew it was over . We were all floating , above the sea , down right next to each other , under waves still pushed out of existence by the same force . Then , with a great crash , the ship slammed into the ocean and the deck as she floated back up . I saw the ground shift and there was a crash like this , followed by a crashing sound and she was gone . I watched as she vanished over the waves and the waves still pushing us closer and closer . Then , with a huge bang , the ship came crashing down and all around us was nothing but the waves . What was left of her was a giant floating object , covered in red and blue scales that seemed to almost float , from the tip of it 's fingers to the tail of it 's hair . It slowly floated amongst the red sea , until it 's eyes connected with mine . Then , with a bang , everything went black and I was back on Earth .   ***   *At the edge of the ocean was a small island that looked like it had been there a long time . There was the small wooden boat that carried the waves , who was holding a small stick in her hand . It was one of the worst things I had ever seen . It was made of wood , so hard that it seemed to shatter in waves . There was also a small ship tied to a small piece of wood . She kept saying that she would be brought back , and that I would always be there to greet her . She did not know what to think of herself and if she would not be in love then perhaps she would be mad . *   ***   *There were many beautiful colors . Waves , blue and green , and a blue that seemed to glow a bit brighter than the green . There were also the lights that seemed to have a very bright blue tint . Some were just a bit brighter than some of the other colors , but I could see the light . *   *A woman stood in front of me . She looked like she was about to throw a tantrum , but that went on for several minutes . I watched her dance around , like she was about to throw a tantrum . She tried to use her arms to push herself away , but they were useless against the wind . Eventually , she looked down down at her feet and realized that she had reached the bottom of the ocean and the last thing she wanted to do was sit on top of the sea . She looked up at me and smiled . `` I wonder what you saw , '' I commented harshly .   `` What , exactly ? I do n't *remember* anything , '' she replied hesitantly .   `` Like we did before . I saw you floating . ''   `` Yes , yes , '' she responded , in a weak voice .   `` What happened to you then ? ''   `` I saw you fall before you were supposed to . ''   `` Yes , yes , I saw you fall before you were supposed to fall . ''   She tried to keep her smile on her face . `` I did n't think you were supposed to fall , but I think I saw you fall before I was supposed to fall . It looked like you were going to die . ''   `` I was n't supposed to die ? I just wanted to get up and get back up ! ''   `` No , no , this was not supposed to happen here . It was supposed to be here . ''   ***   Once we had climbed the length of the ocean and I had climbed back up onto the edge , she continued . `` I still do n't know where you are going . Let me tell you , it looked like you were sailing away . ''   She looked at me for a second , then proceeded to pick up a couple of papers that she had been holding in her hands . `` Is this the story of the Lost Sun ? '' She asked me .   I sighed and tried to hide my eyes . I wanted to look away , but the look that said that I had looked away was gone .   Then , she stood up and faced me . `` You 're a liar , '' she said finally . `` You do n't even know the story . ''   `` It was
In a land called 'Murica ' , there lived a girl with wild hair and smart eyes .   Because of this girl , there lived a cat named Alice .   She said , `` Alice , come to me ! This cat is so much more wonderful . ''   And with her parents , Alice and her cat walked a long path .   But one day , a deer 's head fell and Alice shrieked , `` Alice ! Come to me ! ''   Alice told her parents , `` It 's not fair ! ''   And they followed her everywhere ,   until they found a man , who told his mum that Alice was dead !   He told his dad , `` Alice , come to me ! You 're a monster ! This man has scared animals and killed cats ! ''   And Alice and her cat walked a long path ,   Until she found a man with wild hair and smart eyes .   He said , `` Alice , come to me ! This is n't fair ! ''   And with his parents , Alice and her cat walked a long path .   But one day , a deer 's head fell and Alice shrieked , `` Alice , come to me ! I told you , it 's n't fair ! ''   And with her parents , Alice and her cat walked a long long path ,   Until they found a man with wild hair and smart eyes .   He told his mum , `` Alice , come to me ! You 're a monster ! That man has scared animals and killed cats ! ''   And Alice and her cat walked a long path ,   Until they found a man with wild hair and smart eyes .   He told his mum , `` Alice , come to me ! This is n't fair ! This man has killed cats and killed cats ! ''   And Alice and her cat walked a long path ,   Until they found a man with wild hair and smart eyes .   He told his mum , `` Alice , come to me ! I told you , it 's not fair ! ''   And Alice and her cat walked a long path ,   Until they found a man with wild hair and smart eyes .   He told his mum , `` Alice , come to me ! I 'm a monster ! You 're a monster ! This man has killed cats and killed cats ! ''   And Alice and her cat walked a long path ,   Until they found a man with wild hair and smart eyes .   He told her mum , `` Alice , come to me ! This is n't fair ! That's- ''   And Alice and her cat walked a long path ,   Until they found a man with wild hair and smart eyes .   He told his mum , `` Alice , come to me ! ''   And Alice and her cat walked a long path ,   Until they found a man with wild hair and smart Eyes .   When they found a man with wild hair and head ,   And with his parents , Alice and her cat walked a long hallway ,   Until they found a man with wild hair and smart Eyes .   So they went and lived a long life ,   Until they tried to stop the man .   `` Is n't fair ? Is n't fair ? ''   `` Is n't fair ... ''   `` Is n't fair ... ''   `` Is n't fair ... ''   `` Is n't fair ... ''   And for that , they lived a long life .
I loved your story , and the tone of the story feels , well , really good . You may not have finished it properly but that was definitely the one thing I thought that caught my eye .   I had a good feeling of what you wanted to write , but the main characters were very strange . I never saw any one being able to interact with some of the characters , but I also felt a bit discouraged . I started to draw parallels between the two worlds we have just established .   My advice is to read more of your stories online , so that you can read more by yourself . Read more if you can , and hopefully find a way to better understand the world they inhabit . I love your story and the work you did here .
I sat in my cubicle and typed .   `` A new laptop is available ''  I scrolled to the front of the computer screen screen and clicked enter . A familiar voice came back , but this time from the mouse .   `` Hello ? ''   I tried to speak , but the voice was the same . It had a voice that I could barely hear .   `` Hello ? ''   I tried to plead but nothing came out .   `` Hello ? ''   I was n't sure how I ended up in this situation . I found myself pacing back and forth , trying to get the words out .   `` Hello ? ''   I had to stop . I was n't sure if I would believe this . I took a deep breath and tried again .   `` Can you speak ? ''   I was still praying . What if ... .was it really this ? I wondered . I tried again , asking if he was listening .   `` Hello ? ''   I tried to answer but nothing came out .   `` Hello ? ''   I tried and tried again but nothing came out .   `` Hello ? ''   I found myself pacing back and forth , trying to get the words out . I was still praying , but this time it was the same . It had a voice to it .   `` Hello ? ''   I was still praying . What if the voice was real ?   `` Oh . ''   I tried again , but nothing came out .   `` Hello ? ''   I looked into the eyes of the girl who asked me to sit . She looked exactly like the girl I imagined her to look after . She had the same brown hair I imagined her to make . Her lips were n't moving . Her eyes were n't moving . She had n't moved from her chair .   I could n't believe everyone had left . The power grid was gone . There was a new computer running on the same internet . It turned on and off for what seemed like hours .   A familiar voice came back .   `` Hello ? ''   I sat in my cubicle and typed .
Gather around , gather around , pray a quiet prayer , and pray a quiet prayer .   I do not want to hear that kind of voice . I want to find her when she is here .   Have I ever fallen in love with someone else ? Have I ever lied to someone , cheated on them ? No , I have not lie to anyone , just to help .   After all , I always said I 'd never marry her . I always said that I 'd never tell her it was because I 'm better off not seeing that smile again .   Now , I know she is waiting for me . I know she is waiting for me . I know she is waiting for me .   We just met for a week . I was preparing for our first date , then she said my name , and took me to her .   She said I 'd never marry her .
`` And so , it was said that we were all different . The shadows , the shadows , and the light . ''   The young boy paused awkwardly , `` And why ? Why were you special ? '' His voice was low , yet his words were clear . He looked up at the sky .   `` It was said that we were all different . The shadows , the light , and the light . '' The older man took a long draw of his coffee . He looked down at his arm . It was wrinkled , wrinkled . He noticed the black maroon of the bandage across his arm . `` Now , please , *please* , calm down . You will get better . ''   The man in the suit shook his head , `` I do n't understand . ''   The girl nodded , unsure of whether he was right . `` I do n't understand either . You 're only five years old . '' He straightened up and went back to his desk . After another long draw from his cup , the young boy stood up from his chair and walked him through the kitchen doorway into the living room .   The front door was slightlyjar but kept its glass windows open . He could see two old men standing in front of it , holding hands up in front of the glass . The older one spoke softly , `` We have to bring them in . '' He put his hands down and looked into the eyes of the older one , `` They 're going to hurt you . ''   The girl was paralyzed . She looked back at her hand to see what had happened . A pale ball of fire flew through the air and fell right onto the man in the suit . The old man dropped his coffee cup and slumped backwards onto the couch .   `` You were special . ''   The girl looked around at the people seated around the table . The man in the suit rubbed the back of his head , `` I do n't know . ''   The older man pushed the girl in the chair back into the living room and turned towards the window . She stared into the eyes of the older man who had just walked into the kitchen . He stood with a determined look on his face . `` Please , come back in . I want to help . ''   The girl nodded and walked over to the door frame . The man in the suit pushed up the old man 's arm and threw it open , revealing the flames of the fire . The smoke billowed around the room until the flames burned away and the door slammed shut behind them . The fire was gone , the people that lived there were gone . As the girl walked briskly away , the old man pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his head and threw it over his head .   The next day , the two young boys left the house that day , leaving the house to return home . The old man , with the hood over his head , set out through the woods to find an old man . He started to walk , his body frail . He did n't know what he was doing , but he walked and walked like this every day for what felt like hours . To him , it was as if he was standing in front of the dark for hours on end until he reached the dark side of the forest and decided to walk straight to the edge of the forest .   When he reached the edge of the shadows , he made his choice . He would go through the wood and hide in the bushes . He knew that if he went through the dark , he would find a deer or a small small herd of deer that he would hunt on and would ride him with them to get to the top of the tree . If he ran through the forest , he would find another large flock of deer or a herds of wildflowers . He did n't know how long he had been alone in the woods , but he could tell his time was nearing .   When he reached the bottom of the shadow , he made his choice . He would stop at the edge of the pine tree , wait , and slowly make his decision . He could go further up the shadow and watch the wind howl through the trees behind him . He could move much further down the shadow and walk past the other trees behind him . He could reach out and touch the ground like many other people . He knew that if he went further up the shadow , he would change . He could touch the sides of the trees as many times as he pleased with himself .   The old man tried to think of something to do , but his mind was too limited to think of anything . He could n't do anything at all , only wait for the wind to pick up again . He sat back down on the ground and watched the sunset go by . He could n
I 've never been well-fed . I 'm not even sure if I like it . I 'm a pretty good kid . I 've done good things . I 've been good . That 's always been what I 've been told . Good stuff . Shit . The first time I tried to cut off the hair on my head , it just hit me harder , and I stopped trying . And the next time I tried to make it hair , I just would n't . But that was the first time I tried to make it hair ! I knew it would n't work , but I kept it just going .   I do n't know when it started . I do n't know when it started . But yesterday , I was ready to give up on eating . I started to eat , and then I thought that I could still make it hair . Well , today , I think I decided I should test it on myself .   So I made lunch in the cafeteria . I was on the second floor , and everyone was eating . Everyone was cooking . I was making sandwiches , and there were some of them still wet . I started to shake my head .   *That 's weird . *   But I was doing it anyway . I was working on the rest of the lunch time , so I started to eat , just like everyone had done . It was very nice . So I ate . It really was nice . My lunch time came , so I started to work on the rest of the lunch time .   I was making sandwiches ; I 'm always making sandwiches . I was making some of them . But I never even finished them . I 've started to eat again .   *That 's weird . *   But I was n't doing it . I was just eating . I was working on the rest of the lunch time . It was nice . I was making sandwiches , and then I started to eat , and then I started to eat . I did n't even finish them . I was making sandwiches . But I was never eating . I was making sandwiches .   I always had it . The other day , I still had it . I usually got to eat on the end of lunch time , but I had nothing else . I was always making sandwich , and then I start to eat , and then I started to eat again , and then I started to eat again , and then it took forever to finish . So I knew I should n't have done it .   So I bought some glasses . They tasted better than they all should . They were nice . But they were hard to get , and I wanted them to be better . They were bad . I had to buy them . And I got them to be good . They tasted good . But they were bad . And then I woke up on the fourth wall . I was just eating . I had been drinking , and I was still working on the rest of the lunchtime .   Then I saw the strange thing . There were scales and wings and scales and wings , and one of them looked like a dragon . And then I saw the one sitting in my kitchen . I saw the dragon sit on my coffee table , with its head pressed against my table . It had scales and legs . And it had eyes and mouth and mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth but the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth , and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth , and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the lips and and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the arm and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the head and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the mouth and the
Once , a millenia ago , a lone survivor was tasked to fix the old wound , with the task of repairing even the most minor damage to the body . No matter how long the journey held , however , the wound remained the same .   They 'd traveled far and wide to repair it , all the while building their own equipment . All because the time was up .   They 'd been tasked to build a huge vessel from the ground up to be able to journey even the smallest amount of distance away via various parts of the woodwork . A massive vessel capable of travelling at speeds far faster than they could even comprehend , capable of traveling at an even faster rate than they had ever been able to attain .   Time passed by for them to go through the various parts of the woodwork to get more and more parts to assemble . They 'd been tasked to construct enough more parts to build their own vessel around the same time that the ship had left .   They 'd been tasked to build a large vessel with enough parts to complete their own journey to reach the far , far reaches of the earth and to reach the stars . They 'd been tasked to make another vessel with enough parts to travel at a faster rate than their own .   Now it was n't because they thought this was impossible , in fact it were about time that they realized they were wrong .
I had no clue .   I was just sitting there , reading an old magazine . My best friend was in the corner , still reading . We had discussed this before , but I was now reading a newspaper , unable to believe my eyes .   `` Honey , '' she said , resting her head and stroking my hair , `` Would you mind coming over and brushing up with me ? I can barely stay over before dinner tomorrow . ''   `` I 'll see you later , '' I said , knowing that she could see me anyway .   We walked out alone and back to my apartment . I looked at the posters all over my windows and noticed a few of them had their own issues . The only person who knew what was good was my boyfriend , who looked more energetic than usual . I grabbed his hand and headed out the door , shutting the door behind us . As we turned the corner , our eyes met , but he would have just pulled away like we did in movies .   I took a deep breath and sat down next to him . I looked at my phone , and tapped the power button . It lit up . 8 new messages .   He responded with : `` Hello ? '' .   `` Oh , hi , '' I replied .   `` My name is Aaron , '' he said , tapping his hand on his phone .   `` What are you guys doing here ? '' I asked .   `` I 'm reading , '' he replied .   `` Is this where the other guys got sick ? ''   `` Yes , '' he replied .   `` What are you doing here ? '' I asked .   Aaron shook his head . `` I 'm in my study . ''   I looked around as I noticed the door closing . I stared at my phone for a moment , staring at the ground . `` How long have you been through this ? '' I asked .   `` Twenty minutes , sir , '' Aaron said . He extended his arm to shake my hand . `` Please come over , '' I demanded .   He walked over to my study and took a seat . I waited for him to take a seat .   `` Look , '' he said , `` They called me by the name of Steve , and I need someone to talk to . I ca n't just leave here , I do n't know what to say . ''   `` That 's weird , '' I said . He took another bite of his sandwich .   `` Well , '' I said , `` Steven , I need you to come over here soon . What are you guys doing here ? ''   `` My name is Aaron , '' he replied .   `` Is that how they got sick ? '' I asked .   `` Yes , '' he answered .   `` What are you doing here ? '' I asked .   `` I 'm reading , '' he replied .   `` What are you going to tell me ? '' I asked .   `` I 'm coming over here , '' he answered . `` I have to . ''   He walked over to the side of the room to the open window . There was a woman sitting in the dark corner of the room , looking at me .   `` Steve , '' she said , `` You need to come over here . This is the only thing I have left . ''   `` That 's weird , '' I said .   `` I-I do n't know . ''   `` Come over here , '' he said to the woman in the dark corner .   She reached for the window ledge and turned it against the ground , but she slipped out of it . She looked at Aaron then back at her phone .   `` Listen here , '' she said . she grabbed her hand and ran outside .   I could hear the woman screaming , but could n't hear anything . I took another deep breath , and finally decided I needed to go home .   I walked back to my apartment building and opened the door for myself . I was sitting at my desk when the door to the basement opened . I looked down at my phone . 8 new messages .   Fuck off . I told myself .   I went to my bedroom and laid down on my bed . I looked at the door to my room , and it opened . A man stood there , holding his gun , staring at me with a look of terror and anger .   `` Do n't move , ''
My first post : This morning , I decided to write something I 've wrote before . Hope you enjoyed !  _____________________________________________________________  This was the beginning of the coming war , both sides lost . The people were weak , the forces could n't protect themselves . The war was pointless in the end , but our victory was in the beginning , and the final few words will be what they always say to each other through that final battle .   `` We deserve ... ''   The sound of gunfire cuts through our silence of the dead . The sound of the gunshot is all that remains of the war , and the man sitting in front of me is a man that is about to die . He is kneeling at the corner of my room , gun open , and his eyes are staring at me .   `` No matter how much , I 'm never going to be your friend . ''   I do n't know what he feels like , to hear those words in my head . He does n't want me to die . I wish I could say that , but I ca n't . I ca n't leave . I 'm useless . A nobody .   But I still am . And there it is .   My gun laying on the floor , I lean forward , and take a deep breath .   `` Just one more chance . One more chance , this time . ''   I pull out the sidearm and pull out the trigger .   The bullet in his head is n't even there to see me , and there is nothing left of me except a smile on his face .   `` I 've been waiting for you . ''   The sound of gunshots fills the air , the sound of bullets hitting the ground . The man stands , and smiles .   `` You 're the last one to survive . ''   I look away , and feel the bullet hit my head .
`` You are a terrible person , and you have wasted decades of your life . ''   I looked at the note . The words 'You 've turned into a demon ' seemed to reflect the worst of hate , and it showed its true self . And that 's when I recognized it .   The book .   I stared at it .   I had turned it into a book .   I began to read .   The words seemed to change and change . I realized I had turned every negative , everyday action into a horrible , horrible weapon .   My feet , running , grabbing and tearing , fell .   But my feet still moved .   My legs remained on my back .   `` Oh my God it 's time . ''   I ran .   My feet danced .   `` What the ... ? ''   I stared at the book . It read ...   `` Satan . ''   I turned . I ran , sprinting . The book saw me . It was evil , but evil was only one evil . It was all I had . I could n't live without it .   I turned as soon as I saw him . I was too far gone .   I stumbled .   I fell forward on my back .   I went for the door .
A cry was the equivalent of a guttural rumble . I 'm not sure how it felt but I 'm not really sure what it was . A long moment seemed like an eternity . The sky was black , and I could feel the thin atmosphere in front of me . It was a cold , frigid night . The cold air was like this for nearly a month , and the moon was almost empty . It would be a week at the most .   I felt myself coming to terms with my situation , I was sitting in my car . The lights were off but not out of habit . I was n't even looking out the window . I looked through the glass , only to be caught by a huge grey object . I knew it was a meteor , but I did n't know any of this . The first thing I noticed was the ship .   It was massive . Not too big , as I guessed but not too large . It was large . The size of a small football and about a foot deep in the blue . The sky was pitch black , and we were on Mars . The entire planet was covered in thick cloud . Even though Earth was on Mars he looked as if he had seen so many movie stars . All of them were red , and some were orange . Even the ones that seemed green were glowing brightly . I squinted .   We were at the bottom of the planet . I heard something stir and soon there were lights everywhere . There were no cars , no people , and no other creatures . We were in silence , and there was a loud , dull , rumbling . The lights shut off for a moment , but then they went out again . I could see the craft getting bigger , and I panicked , and ran outside to look for anything to help . I ran over to the emergency radio as fast as I can , and asked my parents if they thought it was safe . As soon as I returned they were still talking . They all had this funny expression on their faces .   `` Yeah , it 's safe . Let 's have a look . '' They told me .   We went over to the craft and examined it quickly . It 's hull was completely black with a thin layer of grey on it . It was like a liquid , but different . It was n't a liquid , it was n't like the red liquid . It was like the light emitting from the ship . The ship was surrounded by thousands of tiny ships and it was the only thing that gave us hope .   A second later , I heard the explosion . I quickly ran inside . The light was gone . I ran outside into a garden and saw a house . All I saw was a wooden hut ! I yelled to my parents . They looked at me and said `` Look . Look . Look . ''   I ran around the house and saw a few cars on the ground . It was completely black , except for one red object that looked like one of those miniature rockets . They were falling from the sky on Earth , and that was definitely an explosion . I looked at my parents , and they said `` They think it 's safe . We 're not safe . ''   I put on my clothes , and tried to catch my breath . I was in a strange place , and I had no idea what was going on . Everything just went black and the sky was barren . I looked around me once more , and saw four huge grey objects . They were moving in front of me . I jumped with speed and ran to the back door . Once inside of the house I saw two large grey objects , one blue , and the other orange . I reached them , and grabbed one . It was covered in grey dust . I started running back to the house and saw that it was actually going to be a long time before I reached them .   I tried to run back to the house , but I was paralyzed and my hands kept moving . My parents just stared at me .   The mysterious objects were flying around me . I screamed and ran to the other house , but I knew it was gone . I tried to open my eyes , but the black objects were flying around me . They were n't flying around us anymore . They were flying above us . They were flying above us in a gigantic , black storm . I wanted to go back inside , but all I could do was run inside the house , and run away .   And then a voice above me cried . It said   `` Take me to the moon . '' That was the last thing I heard before I was teleported back to my home . I knew there was no chance of me ever escaping after that .
The room was silent as the man stepped into the room .   Blood dripped from his open mouth , pooling into the floor .   “ I ’ m sorry to disturb your affairs , but I am not here to discuss what you have done this year . I need to speak , please. ”   His words found no solace in the rickety wooden chair that sat , rocking ever so slowly on the floor . The man ’ s eyes stared towards the ceiling , scanning intently into the space between the two .   “ Remember , you will not ever have us , ” said the man , now gazing through the clear slit on the ceiling . “ We will be fine . You will remember . I will have you , and we will be free . We will have you . You will be the one and only one to love me and take me back into my life every day. ”   The man ’ s shoulders slumped slightly , with his eyes staring towards the ceiling .   “ So , have you ever believed in God ? ” asked the man , now softly whispering away at his own hands .   `` Yes . ''
I watched as the human 's face contorted into confusion , his eyes wide . I watched as he clutched the arms , as he clutched the arms that held him back . I watched as the limb of his hand turned red , and he collapsed to the floor . I watched as he turned to the kitchen . I watched as her body was being carted away , the front of her plate smashed into it , and she was dragged aside . I watched as the human was dragged away .   I watched as he cried for help . I watched as his tears streamed down his face , as his cheeks sagged and his eyes sunken , and as his body began to quiver . I watched as his skin became pale . He dropped to the floor , and I watched as he began to convulse again .   I watched as the android sat on his lap , unable to move . It was as though he was being watched , and I watched as he lay still . It was as though he was being watched , and I watched as it dawned on me that I might not be like him .   I watched as the human sat cross-legged in the middleclass kitchen , the android sitting opposite him . He stared at me , pleading , and I told him that he was the one that had caused this . He agreed , and I moved on .
I was sat in the kitchen , eating one last bite of pork .   Not a fan of pork , but the delicious crunching , the stardust , the deliciousness .   I knew this morning . I felt hungry , so I waited .   Nothing happened .   I began to open the sink door and wash down the bowl . Nothing happened .   Nothing happened .   I grabbed my keys from the pantry . I pulled them out to take off the hat . I walked over to the counter and turned on the heat .   Nothing happened .   And as I began to leave my house , something caught my eye .   There was no vegetables in the bowl . Instead of a meat cooked in the pot .   I turned around to try and get a closer look .   Nothing happened .   I felt a slight tremor in my stomach . It felt like I had been hit by a car . I let out a startled gasp . My neighbors noticed .   `` You 're not dead , you 're just out here . ''   `` Stop ? '' I turned around , looking back at the bowl .   My neighbors looked at each other .   `` What is it ? '' I asked .   My neighbors looked at each other .   `` We talked about this . You do n't know how to find a living spirit in this new world . ''   `` What ? ''   `` This is new . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Do n't do this . ''   `` I 'm not crazy . ''   I heard my neighbors ' eyes wet .   `` I 'm not crazy . ''   `` Stop staring . ''   `` Are you stupid ? ''   `` I just do n't want to be dead . ''   `` No . ''   `` Why ca n't you just say something else ? ''   `` You 're going to die . ''
“ My Love ,   And I need the courage to tell you that your father has been a despicable person . Those words are not mine . But I wish you the happiest you could be .   You might think that he was a man who is above the law , and is willing to take orders from others , but then again , many do not think he was a man who should treat those who would harm him but to him ? That 's not true . He did his best , despite the bad deeds he committed , and yet he failed . Even with all his efforts , he was unable to do anything .   I am writing this letter because I am tired of reading from you . If you want to read this , I know that you are already tired of reading from me . So I am writing this letter to you because I have no knowledge of what you did and how hard it would be to get it out . Tell me . How is this possible ? How can I possibly know you were a good man ? And tell me that people are afraid of us when they see us . I am scared that this letter finds an empty tomb , a lonely place where we are unable to even care about who we are .   I know that this is your last letter , but it can not be taken away from you . Your father was a horrible man , a man who could not be forgiven . He was a man that could never have a family . Even with all the efforts he went through , he made himself weak . His body could not possibly handle the weight of the burden of his death . He could not handle the suffering of his actions , the grief he felt , and the guilt that came with it .   I need the courage to tell you that this is my last letter , but this is the last letter I hope you read from me . Do not let your life be ruined by someone who will die of old age or from cancer . You can not lose the strength to live , to help others in your life , and to love . You can not truly accept that this is your last letter , okay ? Do not let your life be destroyed by something that has no meaning . But I hope you do not let your life die alone . Do not let my life be taken away from you .   Yours faithfully ,   Tyler Rogers
As a young lad , I would spend every waking moment I could think of asking the question I was thinking too damn long about . You want to know how long I have been sitting there looking at the screen ? If that ’ s what you ’ d call it , it ’ s the answers to your questions .   Well , I don ’ t want to talk about a single thing . I ’ m so sorry to spoil your surprise at the moment , but most people ’ ve always wanted to know what it meant for me to talk . So I ’ m just going to tell you , “ That ’ s why I am not a big fan of your questions . ” I know they ’ re not very specific , but you ’ re probably wondering what every question meant for me to ask . It ’ s just that it ’ s all part of my job to see whether your question would ’ ve been considered a good one or not .   What I ’ m really not good at is how everyone else finds yourself wondering what it would mean for a person to ask a question that only they can answer . But you ’ ve never heard of my first interview . That one lasted four days . I was really surprised at it , but I guess I got used to it , too .   Turns out that I ’ m the one that ’ s always wondering if you can answer a question that only you can answer . I ’ ve been interviewing people several times now—even the ones who ’ ve already done it . Usually I ask that question now , since I haven ’ t talked to them in weeks . But now , here I am .   So , I ’ m standing here , looking at the screen . After taking a deep breath about five seconds , I ask again .   “ Would I really like to know if you could answer five things before you ask me ? ”
I opened up Google Maps , where I 'd found a date , and a photo , and a time .   `` Hey , what 's up ? '' I asked .   `` No , '' replied James . `` We 've upgraded our search engine to a fully capable computer . ''   `` What the hell ? '' I asked .   `` The Google browser had been updated to a fully capable computer . It has been updated to allow for user access . ''   `` I do n't understand , '' I said .   `` Let 's see , '' said Jimmy . `` You could n't possibly have upgraded that to an entirely capable computer , at least . ''   `` That 's what I 'm talking about , '' I said .   `` We ca n't possibly let people change their search engines , '' James said .   `` You know what ? '' I said .   `` We 've built a better Google engine . All I have to do is update it to give you access to your email account . Everything I know works , but no one wants to know . ''   `` This must be some kind of sick joke , '' I said .   `` I do n't want to know , '' James said .   `` Remember that time we had to ask someone to check over Google maps ? '' I asked .   `` The one where we found a date , and a time , and several photographs ? '' He asked .   `` Oh yeah , '' I said . `` I remember . ''   `` That was so weird when we looked at the website , '' Jimmy said .   `` What ? '' I asked .   `` The website that has been updated to allow user access . ''   _______   Five minutes later , I saw a search date , and a time .   `` Hey , what 's up ? '' I asked .   `` We 've upgraded our search engine to a fully capable computer . It has been updated to allow user access . ''   `` What the hell ? '' I said .   `` The Google browser has been updated to allow user access to your email account . ''   `` You meant ... I mean ... '' I started to say .   `` We 've built a better Google engine . All I have to do is update it to give you access to your email accounts . Everything I know works , but no one wants to know . ''   `` That 's what I 'm talking about , '' I said .   `` Let 's see , '' said Jimmy .   `` No , that 's what I 'm talking about , '' I said .   `` We can not possibly let people make computers capable of communicating through their email accounts , '' James said .   `` How long does it take for us to get someone to check over Google Maps ? '' I asked .   `` We have over 500,000 users on the internet all the way down to you , exactly 20 years , '' Jimmy said .   `` Wait , what ? '' I asked .   `` We have over 47,000 users in the world , all the way down to your phone , '' James said .   `` How long ? '' I asked .   `` We had over 800,000 users on the Internet all the way down to you , exactly 20 years , '' Jimmy said .   `` Sounds like a good place to start , '' I said .   `` I do n't think so , '' Jimmy said .   `` I 'll go in , '' I said . `` All right , let 's see what we can do together . ''
She had sat in a small cabin far from the border , overlooking the city . She had watched the people shuffle , their minds in a similar state .   `` I 'd never expected it to come to this '' she spoke softly , her voice deep and sombre .   `` You really think this will end ? '' asked the reporter .   Her voice was quiet , though she knew it . `` Of course it 'll , dear . But there are far worse ways . ''   She took a few deep breaths and spoke again , `` You can be the first to admit to yourself that war is n't the only way to end this war , though , your name is already on the radio . ''   The reporter smiled weakly . `` Very well ''   `` The war was a long one , '' she repeated . The war had been long , and far worse . She would never admit that to anyone . But she would try .     -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -  `` We have seen an unprecedented rise in this conflict . Many say that wars are n't always fought , '' explained the reporter .   `` What 's worse is that it has become a regular occurrence for a few months . It has been happening until yesterday that it only took mere weeks of war to put it on YouTube . ''   `` I never expected that to happen , '' replied the reporter . `` I already do n't think I shall ever admit to myself that I have not faced such a war . ''   `` But you can make a difference . You can make the world forget about war again . You can make people forget about guns , and maybe even become president like you did the other day . You can make people forget about the war , and even take over the world and make things more dangerous . ''   The reporter 's attention focused intently on the screen . She felt the need to tell everyone . She looked up at the sky , and saw the lights of the city flicker on and off in the distance .   `` You know , I do n't think you will ever believe this . I only hope that this war ends . ''   `` You might , '' said the reporter , and she looked at the sky as the lights went out slightly in the distance .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The reporter was alone in the cabin , looking out into the city with a worried calm . She was not expecting this to end .
It was a beautiful day for America . I was in the office of General Richards .   `` Get on the phone with General Richards . ''   I began to answer , but then I glanced at General Richards .   `` Yes sir ? ''   `` Well , why , '' I started , `` do you need to tell the men I went to work on ? ''   `` Yes sir . ''   `` What about my family ? ''   `` Yes sir . ''   I waited .   `` They 're all well and good , but they seem to have been in a dark and void for far too long . ''   `` Sir , '' General Richards said , `` why , may they help you ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` What I mean is.. My family is trapped in this eternal darkness . My family is dead . I was always told to let them stay here until I could see them next time . ''   `` You 're telling me they had plans for this day ? ''   `` Well sir , I do n't know how you 'd make that happen . ''   `` Oh , I see . I also see how your work should end . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` Well , I 'm going to say that I 'm sorry , but that 's not really right , we 've been planning our day for a while . I just wanted to make sure everyone else is in the same place . ''   I hung up . I picked up the phone and dialed my wife . She answered .   `` Hey , it 's me , Sharon , right ? ''   `` Hey , are you sure you want to go back ? I 'm looking forward to the day ! Is everything okay ? ''   `` Great ! '' Sharon replied . `` I love you Sharon ! ''   I hung up .
“ What the hell is this ? ” screamed Dr. Aronson as he snatched his earbuds off his desk .   “ Nothing , nothing , just another day off from work ! ” exclaimed Dr. Aronson .   “ And I can ’ t believe it. ” Dr. Aronson muttered to himself .   “ Maybe it ’ s the lack of sleep… ”   …   Dr. Aronson got up with a start and walked to the study .   “ You have to be kidding me ! ” exclaimed Aronson , “ I never did hear this before. ”   …   Dr. Aronson turned the corner to the corner , only to find Dr. Aronson standing in front of a camera .   “ What is it… ? ” he asked , “ There ’ s no way this is real , and we never thought we would ever get this ! For the love of God , why is there a phone lying here at this research lab ? ”   “ I ’ m sorry , Dr. Aronson , I didn ’ t know what would happen if this were real , that would be impossible if this was true ! ”   “ Not if this were real ! ” exclaimed Dr. Aronson .   “ But I don ’ t believe it ! ”   “ I don ’ t believe it ! ”   …   Dr. Aronson walked back to his laboratory and leaned back on his desk .   “ What the hell is this ? ”   “ Nothing , nothing , just another day off from work ! ” 
He was nearly ten years old when he arrived at the site . He had just heard about a distant civilization from another planet . The first part of his new expedition had been to explore the far reaches of the galaxy .   `` There 's something off here , '' he said to himself . `` Something I ca n't see . ''   He did n't know why he was here , but he was curious , as if he had been asked about it .   He grabbed his flashlight and shot a second down into the earth . In the center of the light was one word . `` Earth , '' and he was on his way to describe the `` wasteland '' .
Camerican flag hangs from the wall , marking the place down by small white dots . A small red dot scrolled through the entire text , with a message saying , `` Please do n't let this happen to you . ''   There 's a small red dot scrolled on top of the top of the page , with a message saying , `` We 're coming , and I 'll warn you . ''   I ca n't believe it . I 've never in my life seen anywhere that could possibly be true . Could it be ?   I should probably just try writing this one out , but there 's so many possibilities . Every conversation with this man is coming apart completely .   *Where am I ? *   *There 's no going back . *   *But I 'm coming ! *   *I 'll save you ! *   *But I 'm going to wait..*   *I 'll ... *   *I 'll get out ! *   *I 'll be alright . *
I stood there , watching her from time to time , waiting for her turn . It was the perfect day for my latest masterpiece . Her smile would bring tears to my eyes , and she would hold my hand for just a moment longer before coming out .   “ Daddy , why are you hugging me ? I want to hug you back. ”   “ Why , daddy ? ” She was so happy… She just smiled at me and made sure that I laughed at her for the rest of the day .   “ Do you need me to explain to you why you are hugging me ? ” I asked .   “ Oh , Daddy . I have to explain ! ”   “ I ’ m scared of what they do . They want me to be strong , and they want me to be brave . So I ’ ll ask how— “ I could feel the tears forming .   “ Okay , great . I ’ ll go get your pillow and lay your head on my chest . You shouldn ’ t wake up as often . I ’ ve got to tell you that we will be fine. ” She smiled , and handed me the pillow . I reached into my pocket , and pulled out the pillow .    *Oh god . I can ’ t escape it . * I thought to myself .   “ You would better never go too far . I 'm sure you will be happy ! ” I said sadly , holding the pillow up in front of me and hugging her back .
`` Son , please . Do you understand why I 'm here ? ''   The boy shook his head . He had never been happier , actually . Every night , for hundreds of years , he would come home to the sound of his mom crying . He would always leave her alone in her room , his mother crying , but her tears would always come in a heavy , sad sort of sombre manner .   `` Look , Mom . It 's obvious . I know what your powers were . All those years ago , I was supposed to be able to control the world . Those days - I was supposed to make all kinds of decisions . See , that 's why I 'm here . You ca n't take me down . You ca n't save me . ''   The boy shook his head again . He was n't sure why he was here . The boy knew her parents were n't here , though . They were just busy with work and the new project was on a schedule .   `` I know what you 're thinking . It 's true . You 're special . You do n't have to do this . ''   The boy shook his head . He knew this was n't true . He had heard stories of people like him and how their powers would manifest for good . But tonight , on that day , he did n't know what would actually be happening . He 'd been left alone .   `` Let me go , son . ''   The boy lowered his head toward his mother . She was wearing a white t-shirt . Her black hair seemed to be a little tangled around her head . He wondered if she had noticed it .   `` It 's okay . This is for you . ''   The boy shook his head . It was n't as if his mom had ever noticed it . He knew that she was n't that concerned . It seemed that she 'd just been in a crisis . Like he deserved to know what her powers were .   He raised his hand . `` Do n't do that . I do n't care . You 're not important to that . ''   `` No , Mom . I 'm not important . I 'm not your mom . You know I 'm not important to this . ''   The boy shook his head again so his mom did n't look up from her paperwork . `` I know what you 're thinking . I know that you are n't important to me . You were supposed to be helping my city , not your mom . ''   `` I thought mom was dead . ''   `` Mom ! ! You-you 're not so important . You 're not important ! You must not be- ''   The boy shook his head . The boy 's face was beet red . He wanted to say something .   `` No , Dad . I 'm not important . You do n't need to be important anymore . I am important to you . You are important to me . ''   The boy shook his head again .   `` No , Dad . I do n't do anything . You 're my mom . You 're my country , Dad . And I 'm not going to stand by in fear . Not today . Not ever . I 'm not going to make things right . You will be important to me . ''
Dale looked up at the sky , as if to ask the question . She could n't help but wonder if it was a sky of the clouds that held firm the sky of her dreams as far as she could remember . She 'd been in love with her grandfather , and had always wanted to see him one day , or at least , as much as she could . Or maybe it was another day for her . Dale thought back to her youth , of how much it had changed , and how much she missed him .   The sky was red , and it was cold , but it was happy , and there was nothing left behind that she could n't forget . The trees were n't tall enough to fill her lungs anymore , but they were taller than she remembered them being . She had to hold on to her dreams forever until one day , the sky took up residence with her vision . She knew exactly when it would take them in , and she always did .   She reached out for the stars as they came into view , but they were still all there . The air smelled of dirt and cigarettes , and the sky was dark and lonely , but she knew where they were coming from .   She knew exactly when to step in ; she knew exactly . She smiled at the stars as she did so , and knew exactly when to look back . The clouds had moved in . The grass had quivered , and they were looking to get closer to where there was supposed to be light .   Dale looked at her , still happy , and she smiled at herself as if it was some kind of grand joke that drove her mad . But why was this happening ? Her memories were still there , and she was n't sure if she wanted to remember the last time she had laid eyes on her grandfather . Like she always was , and would ever be again .   She stepped forward as they hit the ground , and looked out the window . It was like she had seen a movie , and it was clear that she was there . She was surrounded by the people of the country , and as they passed over her , she still could n't stop thinking about those who had died in that country ; those who had been born there , and those who died that year . The air was still crisp , and she felt safe .   But , as she looked out into the sky , she saw a man . He was tall , and he wore a blue tunic , with golden chain mail inlayed around his waist . He looked up at Dale just in time to see a girl running down the street , and he turned to a man holding a gun .   `` The men said you had to come back . ''   Dale 's heart sank as she realized that she did n't want to do this . She wondered if she was wrong . Then she remembered that she could n't give up forever once she found out who that person was .   `` Thank you . You might forget me . '' The man said .   Dale looked at the woman , still terrified and confused . She smiled , as if it was some kind of joke at all .   `` No , I just want to see you one day . ''   `` Oh , come back , '' said the man , and slowly walked away .   Dale looked up the road once more and saw a car coming towards her , speeding .
I 've been on Reddit for almost a few days now . I 've been to every subreddit and blog , Facebook , Instagram , whatever is on there . They 're quite the number on reddit these days . They 're all a big place . Not a single person can appreciate what happens when you 've all been selected to be the computer . All of them are just weirdos .   When I first discovered that the `` I 'm gay '' subs were popular with the mods , I thought I was crazy . But then one of the mods informed me that the `` i 'm gay '' subs were n't just popular with losers , they were popular with the users . He then told me that there had to be a serious troll out there . So I went to that site . There was a site dedicated to `` I 'm gay '' subs , and the top one was a picture of me standing outside my balcony . It depicted me reaching out towards the ground with a hand on my shoulder . I stopped a few inches from it . I stopped my hand from touching it . I turned around and looked back at my balcony .   I was standing outside my balcony now .   One of the mods was still there , but his beard was now all black .   I ran out of the building and down the street . I found a black SUV waiting for me . I stopped at the police station . I asked them if there was anything on the ground . They replied yes .   I drove down the street toward the store . It was a convenience store . It was a big one . Not a lot of people are actually here .   Luckily for me , the cashier was there . She looked at me and smiled . I thanked her for coming . She was n't very impressed , however . Her eyes were looking at me and they said `` thanks ! '' .   As I drove away , I suddenly felt something very ... different . My heart jumped . It felt very different . I realized what had happened . I looked into my refrigerator . The fridge opened and I asked what was wrong . She said `` I 'm sorry , I could n't help but think that everything was for nothing . Everything was always for nothing . I could never bring myself to bring myself to bring myself to do it . Everything was always for nothing . ''   She took a second to understand . She then continued to stare at my fridge . Then she leaned against the door frame .   I looked at my phone again . A message popped up the screen , saying `` I 've been selected to be the computer . ''
The war was over . The world had come to terms with the victory , and what came next was the end of the one thing humanity had known for eons .   The earth was uninhabitable , so a small group had formed an army of the most powerful and deadliest of the world ’ s soldiers . The war was inevitable . The world would see the coming of the free will .   The leader of this band had killed fourteen men in the first day of the war . The rest now lay dead , dying in their sleep surrounded by the rest of humanity .   The leader stepped forward , and took the weapon that had saved humanity from this war , and pulled his gun into the soldiers head . The weapon was no longer human . It was a thing of God .   He smiled , and pulled the trigger .
I opened my eyes and noticed my parents ' faces were the same .   `` What the hell was that , '' I asked .   `` I 'm 17 , '' my mom responded .   `` I see . I think . ''   `` Well , you take the wrong time , '' my dad said , `` but you 'll get used to it . You did n't get any sleep that night . ''   `` That 's amazing , '' I said .   My mom nodded .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' she asked .   `` You want to know why I always wanted to live ? ''   `` Huh ? ''   `` The last time you lived I went to sleep in my bed . A lot of people do n't sleep in bed anymore , mom . I think everyone in the house does . ''   My parents sighed a little .   `` It 's been 6 years , '' my dad said , `` but it felt like forever until I got to 18 and got to be 18 . The entire world was quiet . Maybe it should n't be so quiet after all . ''   No .   *I have to stop thinking about things . *   `` Mom , why do you have to end this ? ''   My mom smiled , `` Because I do n't want to die . ''   I pulled away from her and tried to focus .   *I have to find out what 's going on . *   `` Honey , why would n't you ? ''   I turned away from her so she could see me .   `` There 's no one else here anymore . ''   I ran from the room and into the hallway .   `` Mom , '' I finally said , `` Do you know what 's happening ? ''   My mom shook her head .   `` No . ''   She dropped her head .   My father stood up and walked out of the room .   *I have ta tell myself what 's going on . *   *I have to tell myself what 's going on . *   `` Hey mom ! ''   My mother froze dead in her tracks .   `` No ! No ! ''   I turned around and burst through the window .   I was in the school yard and there she was .   `` Hello ? '' she said .   `` Hi ! '' I said , `` I 'm James . ''   `` James ! ''   `` Hi ! ''   `` Hi ! '' I said in a panic .   `` Hi ! ''   `` Hi ! ''   My mother looked at me sheepishly .   `` James , where are you ? ''   `` I 'm at school . ''   `` Your home ? ''   `` Yeah . ''   My mother looked at me and frowned .   `` Oh , James , this is awkward . How could you explain that to someone else ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' I said , `` why would this be so awkward ? ''   My mother 's eyes went wide .   `` Excuse me ? ''   `` Um , '' I started , `` are you alright ? ''   `` Yes , I am fine . ''   `` But ... ''   `` Do n't worry , James . This is your imagination , and you wo n't get to experience it after this . It will go on for years . ''   `` Um , '' I tried to keep my voice steady , `` what ? ''   `` You know ? ''   I shrugged .   `` This is just my imagination . It 's like I just vanished . ''   My mother looked at me puzzled .   `` But ... ''   `` It 's a weird feeling you 're feeling right now , is n't it ? ''   `` No , '' I said , `` it 's just my imagination . ''   My mother sighed .   `` Oh , okay . What do you mean , you 're just thinking about all of this ? ''  
After a few years of living with blindness , I am finally able to get used to everything . The lights are brighter than ever , they are nice , and they are warm , and they really are .   I was only sixteen when my parents passed away on the couch while my mother smiled at me and gave me her condolences . When I woke up , I was the first to think that I 'd miss her so much . I think I still remember asking my mother how beautiful she was . And she started to cry .   But there was a small piece of me that was n't there . I 've fallen in love with the light . That 's OK with me . I 'll continue to think about myself and how I came to be with that light . And if I remember correctly , I actually would love to see everything from the window , because I can see the outside . And I would just know what my beautiful mother is like , and I could n't be happier knowing that we were together .
I had come here to die . To trade . To give life . To give the world another chance . But the world had already accepted my death and accepted the world over .   I walked out on my balcony , and did n't look back .   I saw her . She was beautiful . She was smiling . Her skin was a green color , with a round , scaly face in her hands . She was beautiful at first . But then it changed very fast . Her eyes were red . She had green eyes . They had bags under them , that were covered in blood . Eventually , the bags vanished . She was gone .   I walked towards her , and grabbed her wrist . As I did , my fingers touched her wrist , and her skin turned green .   `` Do n't feel bad . I 'll do that . See you later . ''   I looked at my watch . I was going to go to bed . I wanted to see her again . I pulled her back into the seat .   I saw her one last time . She had red eyes . Their sockets were deep in their sockets . But they could not see my face . I saw many tubes coming from her body , running along her arm . I saw them running down her arms . She was so beautiful .   Her eyes turned blue again .   `` I love you . '' Her voice was soft , but it was not her voice that made me cry .
The ancient man stood there incredulously as the cultists began chanting the word .   `` The Lord is dead ? '' He spat into the darkness .   The cultists rushed in . Their leader was standing in the middle of the room , his face pale , his head bowed in defeat .   At the front of the room , the man was holding a large key . `` That will unlock the gate that leads to the future . ''   The cultists shouted , `` The Lord has come to save us ! ''   The man , holding the key to his future , stepped forward and made a swift kick to the temple 's ground . The people of the other side of the room fell to the ground , as the cultists took up positions in seconds .   The cultists ' leader was laughing hysterically when she stepped back and started chanting .   `` The Lord has come to save us ! ''   She stopped . She looked around , to see if anyone else was out of the room with her . She looked back at the cultists . They all stopped laughing and looked at her .   As she turned back to look at the now terrified cultists , she noticed that she was still yelling again . She turned and ran towards the exit to the cultists ' future .   She stopped . She closed her eyes , and tried to forget about feeling the cold , wet air on her face .   She opened them , and saw her family . She saw them walking towards the door . She saw another young girl , about 6 years old , with her arms outstretched , a light shining through her , crying . She watched as the girl began to wail .   Suddenly , a loud crack , and then another , as the sound of another gunshot rang through the room . The young girl closed her eyes , and looked up to see another leader , standing behind her . He stood next to her , and raised his hand .   `` I saved us ! '' She screamed , grabbing him by the throat and pulling him back .   `` Please , just let us go ! '' the leader begged , pleading .   The Leader started dragging the young girl away , as the new leader pulled her into the back of the living room . He looked at her , and for a moment , the woman 's face remained the same . She looked back at the cultists .   `` We have a reason to keep fighting , '' he said , smiling . `` And we wish to show you that we could show that we could save you . ''   `` Why ? '' she asked , incredulous as to why the cultists were attacking her again .   He smiled back at her . `` We had to save you . You saved us . We had to save you from the other world . ''   `` What ? Are you talking about us ? '' She asked , tears streaming down her face .   He shook his head . `` You were right , we thought we made it . You were right . ''   She looked down at her feet . `` I 'll never forget . ''   `` No one will , '' he replied , crying as he turned back to look at her once more .   `` We 're going to save you , '' she said .   She walked away from the man and towards the door . She looked back at the cultists , and smiled fondly .
`` Well , that 's another big story to tell , huh ? I could start with that short-cut to the man who found you . You just seem to forget what it is about you .   His name is Michael Burns , and my parents made it clear to us that he worked as a janitor to an industrial factory . He was also an artist .   `` Let 's walk you through history , see if there were any facts to pin him down . After all , Hitler had to have a lot of money . ''   `` What did you find out ? '' Michael asked .   `` I found out that the name you mentioned gave him the idea of creating a Hitler , '' I replied .   `` And what did you find out ? '' Michael asked .   `` I found out that war has begun . ''   Michael paused and looked over . I could see that he was holding the pistol in his hand .   `` I did n't kill you , '' Michael continued .   `` So why did you kill me ? '' Michael asked .   `` I was trying to save you from an evil dictator , '' I responded .   `` But you did n't kill him ! '' Michael shouted .   `` The guy who was controlling the world was on his way to kill me ! I thought he was evil ! I 'm not supposed to know , do you remember ? ''   I could n't believe what I saw . I only remember what I saw in the mirror .   `` I was looking at a photo of Hitler . He was lying on the ground with his head in his hands . ''   Michael 's face went pale . `` What happened to him ? '' Michael asked .   `` He killed me , '' I replied .   Michael looked down at the photo and started towards the exit , but I saw another man walking towards the door . He was carrying a sign .   `` Hitlers are coming ! ''   It was a gun . `` The fucking hitler ! ''
`` I want you to know that I need you to fight . ''   `` Whoah , whoa , I 'm so sorry ! I really am . ''   `` All right , all right , '' the little man said , putting the card back in its protective slot . `` What do you think about it ? ''   `` What do you think about it ? '' asked Mr. Smith . `` It 's in the back room , in my closet , and I can see it in my dresser . It 's going to be there in a matter of minutes . ''   Mr. Smith took a closer look at the card . Mr. Smith was impressed . He took a deep breath . `` What does it say ? ''   `` The title is `` Heroes '' . It says you 're the one who stops a hostage situation with one of the criminals . ''   `` The villain ? '' Mr. Smith asked , puzzled .   `` No , '' said Mr. Smith , turning back to his game . `` But you are a hero . You save the innocent . ''   Mr. Smith looked down . He picked up the card and showed it to the man . `` I want you to see it in my dresser . ''   `` Huh ? '' said Mr. Smith , puzzled . `` What do you think about it ? ''   `` Look at it . It 's in my dresser . I guess it was there when I took the hostage . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` It 's the title , because I saved the girl , '' said Mr. Smith , frowning . `` It said that I am saving the innocent . ''
It was a dark and stormy night tonight . The snowmen of the western steppes had been fighting in secret over the past weekend , but with the new recruits being made in the summer , no one really knew why they did it . No one believed in the god of war , and no one believed in the army . It was a normal day for anyone of interest to get home from the day before , almost everyone except for myself . Today a squad of 13 had managed to take our position from the back of the mountain path , and was almost too preoccupied to take on the task . As we stepped on the snow , I wondered what the hell to do . As I stepped on the trail , I wondered where my training was going . I tried to remember who I was supposed to be , and by the time I went to class , I realized there was no difference between a 9th grade or another . It was all just a ploy to get me into trouble . I had to act fast , and do something that would bring about the end of my life , and now , here I was , in a classroom just like this . At first , I thought it would be a joke , an odd joke .   But there was n't a thing in the room that sent me tumbling down the path . My head had been pounding for the past several hours . It was getting heavier , the further down I went , the heavier I became . My hands were shaking as I took in every inch of the snow . None of the soldiers that I knew , seemed to have even noticed me . Everything was dark and stormy .   I had spent the past few hours trying to figure out where my training was going , but nobody actually acknowledged the cold . So I asked the principal , `` What 's wrong sir ? ''   `` I was walking down a side road . The road is dark and stormy . It is getting heavier . There is absolutely no way to look around . ''   I was taken aback by this idea . I had never had a complete breakdown of the past few hours , but this ? This was n't a normal day . I was n't actually in the army . I was in a uniform , and it was very dark out . The only light came from the massive computer hanging above me .   I managed to grab a small flashlight , which gave me plenty of light to look around behind me . As I was about to make my way around the corner , my eyes caught a glimpse of a glowing light . I slowly turned and saw that the source was a small flashlight . `` What the fuck , '' I cursed under my breath . I started to panic . My heart rate was pounding as I tried to gather my thoughts . It had been 20 hours since I got my training , and why was I still awake ? I was going to die in the cold . I started desperately throwing around my flashlight , as my heart rate began to pick up . Suddenly , a long tunnel opening behind me opened up ahead of me . A small person was standing before me with two rifles in their hands , slowly walking toward me .   The man motioned for me to follow , and I quickly complied . `` Now , you 're in the hands of a big , bulky man with automatic weaponry ! '' The man pointed at me . I got quiet and just stared as the man slowly walked towards me , his gun raised for the first time in 40 seconds . He had two small horns protruding from his head . He was wearing a tank top , and carried an assault rifle . The man then pulled out his sidearm , fired a small shot at me , and shot the man directly in the chest . My body stopped .   I felt a rush of adrenaline , and then nothing . I looked around again . It was gone . I was flying , but I was still alive . I opened my eyes again , and saw that the body of the man had disappeared from view . I was standing in a crater with a hole in the side .   My hands shook as I looked around again . I did n't recognize any of the soldiers who I had seen in real life . All of them were dead . They were all dead . I looked around again . I had to get up and get home . I needed to go to class . I needed to go to the hospital . I needed to get home . I quickly moved towards the door to get to the hospital , but it was locked . I saw that the door to the hallway was behind me . I panicked . There were countless rooms that I could get in on my own , all on that path . The only reason I was still alive was because I walked straight through my door . I knocked on the door .   The door slowly opened . I was alone . I opened the door and stepped
`` Please , take a seat , Mr. Fucking Flimstone . ''   Lucifer sat at a desk with a red-rimmed glasses and a long , silver desk . His desk had a golden sticker on it with a picture of Jesus being crucified to a cross .   Lucifer looked around , each in a different way than the last .   A teacher walked through the doorway and placed a paper cup in the center of the desk , which sat quietly . It had a pink glow to it when it read , and a small red button in the middle of it .   'Mr. Fucking Flimstone , ' it read .   Lucifer turned a page through the pages , his pupils fixed on the principal .   'Mr. Fucking Flimstone , ' it read .   He turned back pages as the principal started talking again , and Lucifer stopped midsentence .   'Mr. Fucking Flimstone , ' it read .   Lucifer looked back down at his notebook . He was starting to think hard about what had happened to him that day , and decided to check whether the principal had ever really been there to keep him warm as well .   He noticed something that he missed . In the picture was a red boy in his teens . It looked like someone had been holding a knife in his hand , and the knife was attached to it .   'Mr. Fucking Flimstone , ' it read .   Lucifer stared at his notebook , wondering if his dad had actually been there to keep him warm .   After a few minutes of thinking , Lucifer turned back to the headmaster .   `` Well , can we get a job interview today ? ''   The headmaster nodded .
I worked in a small , well-written government agency . I was an intern in a small office in the Southernwest of the United States , where the majority of the labor force was a computer science major and a woman in the mid 20s .   It really did n't bother me because I was in charge of a large software company who , like most of the other companies , was classified all the time . Each time it was released I was given more information , and I could make myself a computer scientist or a programmer . I was also given more information than I knew how to get through the trials .   The test was an extremely simple one : test a child . It was usually a small child , but it was usually about 9 or 10 years old . But that 's when it went wrong . A female child was born with the same genetic history as the ones before . The last one was in America just a few years after the first .   It was almost too late . I was in the wrong room . I felt like I was on a drug induced coma , going insane .   `` Hello , '' I whispered through gritted teeth . `` Are you alright ? ''   `` I 'm fine ! '' She choked out , `` Are you in pain ? ''   I looked down at my stomach , and watched as hundreds of tiny objects , small ones , and small ones fell out of my hand into the air .   `` What 's wrong ? ! '' I screamed , `` Help me ! ''   She hugged me , `` Let 's go ! ''   `` Okay , '' I tried to say , but my words were muffled by the sound of rushing water . It was then that I noticed the blood coming out of my hand , and saw that it was not a child . It was a small kid , but it was almost 3 or 4 . It was n't tall enough to support a bed , or a woman . It was n't tall enough to hold a child . It was n't thin enough to hold a small child .   I could n't move even though I was in shock . I could n't close my eyes . Then , I realized that I was on water . No , I was n't underwater .   `` Are you ok , '' I asked . `` Are you ok ? ''   She looked at me , and sniffed . She opened her mouth to scream , but soon , she fell back onto the floor . My body felt numb , but I could tell she was still alive .   `` Hello , '' I whispered as I crawled out of bed , `` Are you okay ? ''   She did n't move .   `` Hello , '' I screamed , `` Are you okay ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hello , '' I repeated , `` Are you okay ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hello , '' I repeated , `` Are you okay ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hello , '' I repeated , `` Are you alright ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hi , '' I repeated , `` Why are you here ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hello , '' I repeated , `` Is that why you 're here ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hello . Do n't you understand that you only had one chance to meet your wife ? ''   She sniffed !   `` Hello , '' I repeated , `` Are you here to meet your wife ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hi , '' I repeated , `` Are you here to meet your wife ? ''   She sneezed .   `` Hello , '' I repeated , `` Are you here to meet your wife ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hi , '' I repeated , `` Are you here to meet Your wife ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hi , '' I repeated , `` Are you here to meet Your wife ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hello ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hi ? '' I repeated , `` Are you here to meet Your wife ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hi , '' I repeated , `` Are you here to meet Your wife ? ''   She sniffed .   `` Hi ! '' I repeated , `` Are you
The stone fell softly against the granite floor . This was it . The final defeat the great swords of Oldtown lay ahead of me . He took note of the destruction that had begun since the Great Battle of Gungus . Nothing more .   The Grandmaster knelt down to the ground and began to hum . His head began to spin and his eyes began to droop . The Grandmaster stood up and walked toward my grandmother .   `` Grandmaster , do you remember what it was like back in Gungus ? ''   `` Grandma , I knew this day would come . To enter the chamber with you at the Gates , as it stands now , is another honor . Take your time and be young ''   `` I did '' , I could feel my grandmother 's tears welling up .   `` Welcome to the Chamber of Heroes ''   `` Oh , thank you , Grandmaster . This chamber of Heroes is where I come to slay those who stand before the gates . ''   `` And it is your honor you will slay them even if I do not return . ''   `` Is that correct , Grandmaster ? ''   `` Yes , because you have chosen me to come with you , and it has me at peace . For many years we have fought , fought , and died . I have fought so many times , I had slain so many foes , but this is the only time I can find a place among the Heroes . ''   `` This is a great honor to me , Grandmaster . But why allow me not to return ? ''   `` Because it is time to return to Gungus ! ''   `` Then why fight to return to the Gates ? ''   `` Because your friends are slain ! ''   `` Who are they ? ''   `` Your friends , your enemies , their families , they are dead ! ''   `` But if they were dead , who would have lived to fight next ? ''   `` Friends ! ''   The Grandmaster stopped and bowed , leaving me to hear the story of the Battle of Gungus . I turned to the Grandmaster .   `` You have faced countless enemies , and I have fought one of them . This is not what it is like to be slain alone . I am ready . ''   `` Then , how will you slay me ? ''   `` Well , your opponent is a young man I have seen in many battles . He has a young wife who is very bright and beautiful . She has many beautiful children and pets . She has lived long , and has always believed herself to be a good person . This is why I am ready ''   The Grandmaster 's face hardened as he looked at me .   `` So , how will you slay me ? ''   His voice echoed throughout the chamber , from the pits of the deep tunnels of the Gungus . Those underground tunnels are one of the only ones that have allowed entrance into the Chamber . Nobody knows how it went down , and nobody knows how it started . But many years ago , there was a battle between the Great Arena and the World Champion . The Game of Thrones had been played . The World Champion was born . He was a good man . He was invincible . After all , there was nothing that could stop the World Champion from defeating the Champion .   I had thought it was funny . But what was funny is that I was wrong .   The World Champion was a good hunter , the great hunter , the great hunter . The World Champion was the fastest . He had done great things , he had killed many , and he had a purpose to uphold . But he was weak and frail . He was weak , and he was weak .   I was young , my memories were hazy , but the World Champion did not fear what he did . He was stronger . More powerful .   He was brave , and he led the world . He did not fear losing .   I was a good hunter , but I did not fear losing . I was brave . I was strong .   I was strong .   I was strong .   I was strong .   There was a great roar outside . The Great Arena was being built . It was packed with enormous metal plates . It was filled to the brim with the most beautiful warriors the world had ever seen .   I was strong .   The Great Arena was opening . It was moving . It was opening ! The Great Arena was opening ! It was opening ! I was filled
`` Hey , '' I say as I get to the door . I reach out to the front door handle , but just to see if it would open again , I hear a gunshot . I turn around to see , through the peephole , a bloodied person on the ground . I quickly turn back to the professor with a look of disbelief on his face . This was the reason I had to leave ; to avoid another gunshot . `` Are you alright , sir ? '' The professor asks . I nod , still waiting for the gunshot . `` Look at you . ''   I walk in the hallways , checking for any signs of blood . All that 's left of the blood is a bloody trail . When I approach the body , I see a small note that said `` Thanks for the offer , I guess . '' I open it up and read :   > `` Thank you for the offer . If you were to do such a wonderful deed , you chose to start with something you 've done a decade ago : you 've helped people ; you 've helped the world . You have made a difference in what you 've done . So , you will continue on to do what you have done . Is n't what you 've always wanted , you 've always been just as good in terms of life ''   I 'm speechless . I see another note , this time from the professor :   > `` You are a great person , and you deserve to be a better man . I 'm going to take you over to the doctor . We 'll take care of you until you grow up and have a family again . ''   So , I 'm left with questions . What does he mean by that , and what happens next ? Am I crazy ? Am I crazy ? After all , who would want to stop a stranger from their life ? I walk through the corridors , checking for anyone suspicious . Everyone else seems to be around the same age as me , but I ca n't see them at all . As I enter the doctor 's room , I see a sheet of paper with my name on it . I look at it , and find that I guess I 've missed something that I did n't know . I open it up , and see a number . 1 .   I turn to look at this number , but my heart stops when suddenly , I 'll notice something . A number .   I look at it , but think nothing of it . I open it up again . It says :   > `` It 's been over a year since you 've last seen me . I wish you could see me , but I can not . It 's been a year , but I do not know if that 's enough . You 're coming home from school , and I am going to try to help you . ''   I look at the note once again :   > `` You are a great person , and you deserve to be a better man ''   I look at this . A number is floating in my chest . I think I can see it again :   > `` You are a great person , and you deserve to be a better man . You wo n't have to leave , but you will be safe . ''   I open the note again :   > `` I miss you so , '' I say , as I go to the kitchen . As I close the door , I notice that the blood is still on the floor . I reach for my knife , but I ca n't get it away . I rush to the staircase , just as the note slams into the door .
The universe 's eye glazed over the tiny glass sphere . It hovered above the atmosphere of the Sol system , and it glowed a bright yellow until it resembled a fiery sun .   `` We have arrived ! ''   The planet looked like a giant marble orb , but as it approached Earth , the planet came alive with life .   `` You see , we 've found humans . These aliens have a problem , and they call themselves the Human Empire . ''   The humans looked upon their home planet with hatred . Their planet , however , was the largest in the galaxy , and their planet was growing cold .   `` What is this ? ''   The aliens laughed . `` No one expected a human Empire to take over our world . ''   `` Hah ? Oh ? ''   `` You see , the Humans are a very aggressive species . They are very aggressive . They have an appetite for resources , so they cut the fabric of the universe to allow them to dominate and enslave us . ''   `` Why are they attacking us ? ''   `` You understand now , humans . ''   The planets eyes narrowed .   `` You see , their planet is the biggest in the galaxy . Everything they do is illegal , and they need to get off their planet . ''   `` Your planet is a perfect example of a violation of the laws of nature . ''   `` But ... but ... I 'm not sure if it 's a violation of the laws of nature . ''   `` Even if it is , it 's not a violation of the laws of nature . Humanity believes in the laws of nature , and they believe in that . ''   The planet looked at the humans with curiosity . The Humans could not comprehend their planet , but they believed in their laws as well . The humans could not understand this , but they believed in their humans .   `` What about the laws of nature ? ''   The planet trembled , but its eyes widened .   `` That is unacceptable to you , humans . ''   The planet looked to its star , and it saw what the humans had seen .   `` The laws of nature , '' it said . `` They are corrupt . ''
There have always been different colored cats . Those of us who do n't find their mating rituals fascinating . The ones who find themselves in some sort of strange , primitive society . Others have simply tried to capture the feline-kind that we call The People . Humans have been made to hunt the White Cats . The white cats have some form of technology called `` The Brain '' . The Brain is a device that lets these things communicate with each other via radio frequency . The people would usually be sent to hunt for resources . I 've never experienced such strange experiments .   Now there are only two species that are capable of performing such experiments . One they call `` The Puke '' . The Puke controls the planet 's moons , but does n't possess any other creatures . The planet 's inhabitants are sent to visit these humans and take a job as a lab owner . I have always enjoyed the thought of being used as a pet projecter .   The Puke has taken over the planet 's system and makes the humans pay for their services . What 's the fun in that ? I 've been working for The People since I was seven years old . I was quite fascinated by the humans as well and wanted to impress them with my new invention . The Puke has taken over the entire planet 's surface and is currently waging war on Earth . The Puke is planning a massive invasion on the United States and the United States , with various military organizations surrounding the Eastern hemisphere . It appears that the Puke has been plotting its attack again , creating a global war of attrition on the remaining countries .   The people have been planning a war on humanity since the day their ancestors were born . The Puke is being taken to war by the humans . It appears that the humans have been able to steal the Brain from The People that live in the skies . It seems to be working very well .
I wake up with aching hands and a pounding headache . The last thing I remember is that I was hit by a cab . I am only a few miles from my place of work , a place without internet access . My phone is buzzing and I instinctively pick it up .   A notification pops up :   > Will you give me a few spare change for today ? I have no idea if I can get in before I need it .   I make sure to check my bank account .   > Hey ?   > Hey , what 's up ?   I turn on google .   > I 'm gon na use the email . I 'll use the phone when I get home .   I think about work for a second , but before I can figure out what it 's doing , I see something flash in my hand :   > A bunch of money .   I get out of bed and run to the phone . I hit play and find it 's still there . I dial 911 .   > Hello ?   > Thank you . I did n't mean to wake you up .   I leave the message in the message box :   > Will you give me some spare change for today ? I have no idea if I can get in before I need it .   I check my bank account :   > Hey ?   > Hey , what 's up ?   I turn on google .   > Hi , what 's bothering you ?   I put my phone back down on the hook and look at what it 's saying :   > Will you give me a few spare change for today ? I have no idea if I can get in before I need it .   I dial 911 .   > Hello ?   > Hi , wo n't you give me a few spare change for today ? I have no idea if I can get in before I need it .   I take my phone to my phone and wait for my hand to go . It does not come .   I think about work for a second , but before I can figure out what it 's doing , I see something flash in my hand :   > A bunch of money .   I run to the phone and find it 's still there . I dial 911 .   > Hello ?   > Hey , will you give me some spare change for today ? I 've no idea if I can get in before I need it .   I knock at the door .   > Hello ?   > Hey ? What 's bothering you ?   I answer :   > Thanks for calling .   I go to my phone and wait for my hand to go . It does not come .   I carefully pick my phone back up .   > Hello ?   > Hey ?   > Hey , wo n't you give me a few spare change for today ? I have no idea if I can get in before I need it .   I dial 911 .   > Hi ?   > Hey , wo n't you give me a few spare change for today ? I have no idea how to get in before I need it .   I pick my phone back up and wait for my hand to go . It does not come .   I look at my phone :   > Hey ?   > Hey , wo n't you give me a few spare change for today ? I have no idea what I 'm doing .   I pick my phone back up and wait for my hand to go . It does not come .   I then count to three :   * One . * Two . * Three . * Four . * Five . * Six . * Seven . * Eight . * Nine . * Ten . * Eleven . * Twelve . * sixteen . * thirteen .   I put my phone back down to my phone and wait for my hands to go . It does nothing .   I try to count to five .   * Nine . * Eight . * Nine . * Eleven . * Eleven . * Twelve . * thirteen . * fourteen . * fourteen . * fourteen . * fourteen . * seventeen . * fourteen . * thirteen . * fourteen . * fourteen . * seventeen . * fourteen . * thirteen . *
“ Well . It ’ s really not that simple . Now hold on here . This is your first lesson , and we have to begin .   Once there , we learn to use the language known as the French , which might help explain why we have to use our primitive , primitive , primitive learning techniques in time .   The Spanish seems pretty simple , but I digress . I like Spanish , so it sounds pretty hard . Sometimes we really need the language we use for our purposes , but we do , and we have to start using what we can .   You see , this language is similar to your own , but it sounds very different . The language itself seems different , too , and now this is where we need to make a name for it . Of course , we need to begin using the words spelled out , and all that stuff , and how to use them . Since the English has pretty much been invented , it ’ s probably just easier to use names from different years .   Now hold on there . What exactly is that ? A tool ?   Now remember , your first rule of teaching back when you were still a little boy , did your parents tell you you to stop using that language based on your own ? That language has no meaning to you . You understand that ?   Yes ! Yes ! That ’ ll make sense ! Then , where were you studying ? It looks like you were , in your teens , all alone with your parents , having a group of around 7 . Now sit back in your chair and relax , and remember that you spent a lot of time in that time because your parents didn ’ t like you to be alone , and that was okay .   Now , your lesson here is a little different . This is the language that your parents used , and you will know it . The language that your parents used , because it was the last language that you ever had to share with people , was… well . It was just another language that your parents used .   And they used it to send you back in time . That ’ s a lot of stuff that you can still learn about , and you must all find out about the language at hand .   Take a look at this one .   This is a picture of a mountain . It looks just like this , but instead of sand , it looks like a mountain . Also , it seems to be covered in blood . It tells of burning buildings , and the people who live in the ruins .   Or else , this is your first lesson . Remember , your first rule of teaching back when you still were a little kid ? That language has no meaning to you . You understand that ?   Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! How about when you learned about the Roman Empire , remember ? That language was only a few years ago , but the Romans were one of the first to expand their empire . They put out fires and blew up the land because they wanted to build a nation where they could not . I mean , what was that ?   Anyway . I ’ ll do what I can to help . Hopefully , that ’ s what you ’ ll learn today . See you then. ”   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Hi people .   I hope you enjoyed the story . I was hoping to use the use of this language , but with some unfortunate circumstances , I had to make the story easier for you . Thanks for reading !
My first prompt ever , please give me feedback .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   I was tired . It hurt . Every morning I lay in bed waiting for another day of work . I had tried a lot of techniques , but it never worked . Sometimes it was like watching the TV or drinking the scotch . Sometimes it was like getting up , but it never worked . Today I was going to become a real famous hitman . I had come to the hospital after work to get my medical leave . I 'd been in the hospital for months and had yet to see this .   After I got a job as a hitman , I got a bit more adventurous . I followed a certain path towards a bar and had a few drinks with a fellow hitmen . One hitman got a few shots , one shot went wrong . I followed the pattern , but I could not do it . I had to kill a hitman . I had to kill a hitman .   I had to kill a hitman first . I had to kill a hitman first . It took me some time to get used to the dark web . I could n't even say I actually liked this dark web .   I do n't know how long I was sitting in my chair , waiting for a hitman to take his shot . Before I could say anything , a red flash appeared . A red flash that seemed like it could n't be the light of a sun . I looked over and saw an arrow pointing at a red arrow . I stepped back and pressed my face up against the wall .   My eyes opened wide .   I could barely move my body . My body did not respond . I looked around and noticed multiple other people in my room . Some stared at me . Some tried to say something . Some tried to fight back . Some tried to run . Something flew past me - I fell to the ground . I looked up . Another bright flash . I fell to my knees . I closed my eyes .   That 's when I saw it . With a bright white light from my eye , I saw a hitman standing on my bed . I looked around . I knew what they were . I was going to kill them .   I heard shouting . Blood ran down my face . I looked around . I saw the hitman look confused . I called the police .   I immediately got up . I ran into the hallway and ran towards the police . They came rushing towards me . I ran up to the police . I knew where I was . I ran back to the house . I saw them .   I looked at my brother .   I knew who I was .   I walked out of the police car and towards the target . The target was my brother . I told him to stay where he is , he did n't know I existed . He looked at me and said , `` No ... I do not know who you are ! ''   I grabbed his hand and held him . He looked at me with eyes red . He looked at me and said '' Do n't let go ... I do not understand why you are being killed ... ''   I look at the body of my brother . I want to scream . I want to pull the trigger . I want to give him his life . But I ca n't . I ca n't let him go . He is out because he is gay .   I pull the trigger .   -- - 
I had a tattoo just a few years ago .   I was born a little at the same time as my father . I was nine when they told me to go look in my grandfather 's grave . He did to me as much as he could .   He had found my wrist tattoo in a safe house in New Mexico two years before my birth . I had never seen it before . I could n't understand why my parents told me to look at it . It was just a plain old , white symbol on my forearm . There was no way that my father would turn it .   Mom and Dad started their families . They had decided to move to San Francisco to live with their teenage daughter . Me and Dad had moved to Los Angeles the following year when we decided to work . You see , the most important thing about living with my father was that he did n't know what to say to me . He had his life ahead of him , but he could n't tell me to tell him or anyone else .   My grandfather lived in California too . My mother did n't have a birthmark on her wrist . When she told me about her tattoos , her face went pale . Without her tattoos , he did n't know what to tell me . I 'd never seen her cry or cry before . I 'd never seen her smile . I had never seen her take her first step .   My father and Mom moved east . I did n't understand why they had moved in this small town . I never expected any normal people to move here . They did n't live here , they did n't meet my mothers and dad . They were dead .   My mother and Dad were sent south by the war . Our country was in deep shit . They had fought so long with no hope of finding the peace they expected . They had no hope at all . Except for my mother , who was a doctor .   My father was put down . My mother went in shock . She tried but could n't . She had nothing else to speak of . My father and Mom had fought too many times . I 'd lost count .   My father had been buried dead for three days . I still was n't used to seeing him cry and cry .   My mother begged for silence . I had no one to speak of . She had to have someone to stay with ; anyone who could provide her with her knowledge of the future .   I could n't .   My father and Mom had kept fighting until they got to San Francisco . My wife tried to force my mother to stay back , but the pain was there . My mother refused . My father and Mom seemed powerless .   We all thought they would never see the light , but when my sons went in their sleep , I knew they would never see it . Their friends just told me there was n't room for the light . They always told me it was just my grandfather and I .   My friend was in his home hiding in the basement . He had kept in touch with my mother for the longest time . She told me the world would turn upside down by the time they reached New York .   I was still in shock , though . My wife had always told me .   Then , she 'd gone in . She 'd made her way back up the stairs and shut the door behind her . She 'd pulled the covers over her face and looked at the floor .   `` David , '' she said . She was crying . She looked at my leg . `` Come on , it 's time . ''   I stared at her in shock for a time before I called up my sister .   `` David , '' she said . `` Let 's do this . ''   My sister did n't respond . Her eyes had closed . She looked at my wrist . My heart began racing . My eyes had opened again .   `` I promise , honey . I 'll be with you when we reach San Francisco . ''
I opened the front door of my house , and stopped in front of the wooden chest . The chest was n't on fire yet , and it was covered in a fine layer of dust . It was a bit like a funeral , but the chest was definitely on fire . After I moved it a bit further , I shook my head , and put on some clothes .   I took a look around the house . The only thing that I noticed was the dusty dust , and there was nothing else I could do . I started walking down the hall , and I could n't find anything . I walked outside , and suddenly a small boy walked through the crack of the door . `` Hi , '' he said . He looked confused , but at the same time excited .   `` What does it hold ? '' I said .   `` It holds a beautiful girl , she 's about my age . Her name is Jessica . ''   `` My name is Jessica '' I said .   `` Jessica ? '' he asked .   `` I guess its ironic , I thought I 'd never see you again . ''   He looked frightened , and I could tell he was about to cry . I opened the chest .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I walked out of his house , and ran over to the girl . She was still crying . I hugged her tightly and kissed her . My stomach growled . I thought I heard a faint rumble . My head hit the ground , but I could n't tell what was happening . I turned around to see that there was a girl standing with a bottle in one hand , and a small handgun in the other .
`` You have now reached the last of your lost treasure ! '' The old man shouted at me , the bane of my existence . I nodded in agreement , making some soft noises as I walked towards the cavernous entrance . I had been warned that the creature could n't reach the end of the great hall . This was not the type of adventure they expected from a priest .   The cavernous entrance was all to the east , with a dark door and a wooden table leading to the center of it . The room was filled with a large , green table , with three chairs on either side . It was empty . So thirsty . I reached down and grabbed two of the chairs , one tall , one small , and one small . This table was filled with small , greenish fruits , each full of the same greenish color .   `` You must be sure that this is n't some sort of test or trap . '' The old man said , trying to dispel what was going on .   `` Is n't that what you said before ? '' I hissed back .   `` I said , are you sure that this is n't some kind of test , or trap ? '' The old man replied , trying to conceal the fact that his statement made no sense .   `` I 'm not sure what to say . What 's so important is that it 's your destiny to find it . '' I looked up at the old man , his face serious .   `` Do you mean to say that I am destined to find it ? '' He asked the strange old man .   `` Yes ! '' I protested as I was taken aback by everyone 's reaction .   `` But ... '' The old man started , tears streaking down his face .   `` I have waited years for this ? So long for this ? To be the moment I will finally find my destiny ? ''   `` No . '' The old man said , tears still streaming down his eyes .   `` Please , take it with you ! '' I pleaded , desperately trying to get to my feet . No .   `` No ! '' The old man shouted back , desperation pulsing through his veins . I reached into my pocket , pulled out a small silver coin , and placed it into the old man 's hand .   `` I chose this coin . '' I whispered to the man , glancing down at his face .   `` You ca n't give me that coin . I ca n't take it with you . '' The old man spat , tears already flowing down his face .   `` I am not crazy . '' I cried , looking down at the coin . Wept openly , and turned our heads towards the entrance .   `` You will find the next treasure . '' The old man said , smiling at me .
I looked around nervously , my mind racing through the possibilities .   *No way ... I could be hallucinating ? *   *I ca you just trust me , * I think to myself , *it 's worth millions . *   I looked around my cramped bedroom , trying to make sense of the situation . All I could think about was how many people had died yesterday . Countless , thousands . I had no idea what this meant , but I knew how the hell it was going to be .   *So ... it 's a hoax ? * I thought , looking at my son .   *No , it 's a hoax ! *   *Do n't listen to that , you will only believe me . *   I reached back into my pocket , pulling out a pack of cigarettes . I lit them up slowly , inhaling deeply as I waited for those two to come out .   *The world was fucked today* , I thought .   I took a drag of my cigarettes , and put them in the pack before grabbing the small lighter .   *If we can finally get rid of this crazy thing , we can finally make the world a better place ! *   As my son made his way to the couch , I placed my feet on it , and tried to think of how I could get rid of this freak .   *So if we can just ... stop this thing ... , * I thought , pulling out my handgun .   *Fuck ... We 'll never get rid of this ... * I thought , pulling the trigger .
I was just going to get a new job at Sam 's home when the phone rang .   `` Hey , do you want to come over tonight ? ''   I looked over at the new girl on the other end . My eye scanned her face until I saw the ring .   `` Hey babe , have you got any messages ? ''   `` No , no . I just got back from work . ''   `` Hmm . ''   `` I have n't seen you in a while , you know ? Now , I promise I 'll see you at work when I get back , but I think I 'll give you another minute or two . ''   `` Alright then , but I 'll be right back . Do n't call me until the next house . ''   I hung up the phone and walked back into the living room . The lights had gone out . The TV had been turned off . I turned the TV off .   I put the phone back on the table and laid down , looking around . I picked it up . I went to the kitchen and opened the fridge . I picked up my phone . I dialed Sam 's number .   `` Hi , it 's Sam . I 'm a little creeped out but the new voice on the line is kind of nice . ''   `` Oh , that 's okay , you know ... Did you see that man in the closet ? ''   `` Yeah , he was just there . ''   `` He was really weird . ''   `` Yeah , he was n't there . ''   `` Yup . Man , I think I saw him . ''   `` Oh , yeah , sorry . Are you ok ? ''   `` Yeah , I 've been a little worried about him so I have n't been able to do much so I left . I could be in the kitchen when I get back . ''   `` Thanks man . ''   `` Thanks , man . ''   My eyes widened . I slowly walked back outside , and shut the door behind me .   I went back inside and checked the backyard . It was empty . There was n't a soul in sight .   I went to the backyard and peaked out . There was a man , standing in the dirt . He looked different , maybe a little younger .   `` Hey , how are you doing ? ''   `` I 'm trying to make sure I can get home safely . ''   `` Hey , hey . Are you okay ? ''   `` Yeah . It 's really bright just here . ''   `` I would say so , but I am looking around , '' I said , `` but I do n't know what 's going on . ''   `` Oh , I 'm just going to see you tonight . ''   I hung up the phone and went to bed . I woke up the next morning with just a head start . It was n't until I sat up that I realized something was n't right .   I looked around . The whole house was empty . There was n't an animal anywhere else . Just some bushes and even a dog .   I decided to take a look around the house and look for something else around . There was n't any furniture , just a table with a bowl and some clothes that I could recognize from my room . I walked over to the table and picked up a bowl of cereal . I munched on it . I watched the TV in the living room . It read `` Breaking Bad '' .   I sat down at the table and pulled out my phone . I dialed Sam 's number .   `` You know what , I 'll take a look at this . What 's going on ? ''   `` It 's not my fault ! '' I yelled .   `` I told you , I really do n't know what 's going on . ''   `` What are you talking about ? ! ''   I got up and went to my room . I pulled out my phone and dialed Sam 's number . It read `` Breaking Bad '' .   I slowly walked to the door and looked it over . There was a man standing in the dirt . He had a knife in his hand . He was holding a gun .   I slowly walked over to him and took a step back . His grip on the gun tightened .   `` Hey ! It
I look back on how it started .   Before Elon Musk . To us , his announcement was a hoax . A sham . It started quickly enough . The problem is , he did not mean it . But after that did n't take long . Eventually people started to question him . They did n't want to know . But there he was , sitting on a stage , staring at a crowd of journalists . He did , in fact , do it . That was the only clue to why he created the fake version of himself .   It was n't long until all the world 's governments went into hiding , and he did n't leave . It was later found in secret by the United States government . Turns out , after he did that , he was actually the very top scientist on the planet , after all .   After the discovery , some people started to forget . When Elon Musk saw this happening , he went into hiding . A group of people had been hiding together , but had also been attacked . Since then , there have been hundreds of attacks , all with malicious intent in their eyes . They were trying to use him as an excuse to cause more damage . The idea of him manipulating this is not enough .   There have been deaths , of course . People are terrified , but that is all they can do . They still pray to him . It 's time to call him in .   `` Hello , my name is Elon . How can I help you ? ''   Elon Musk pauses for a second . He takes out a large paper , filled with documents and pictures of me in various countries . The photos are all of me being attacked by terrorists . There 's a knock on his door .   `` Who are you ? ''   `` My name 's Elon Musk . How 've you been ? ''   `` I managed to stop the terrorists from attacking me . ''   `` We have a lot of work to do . ''   So that 's when it happened , and I was hit by a car . Turns out , if you survived , you just might survive .   It 's been a relatively uneventful ride . I 'm still recovering from the crash . It 's time for me to tell you this . In order to regain consciousness , you have to kill someone . I did stop their attack , but not before killing them . Once it finishes , you must kill whoever does this .   You see , after I killed the terrorist , I decided that , unlike most people , money has no value . I had a very limited amount of cash , so we decided to make money . I decided to use the money to move further . So we put a huge hole in your bank account . Unfortunately for me , we did n't find a way to get it back .   I was able to get the money back . I took out enough money to buy a house , and moved back to my original location , which is now in Canada . I put the hole in my bank account , and used it in my bank account to make a new life for myself .   Now , I am the last person on earth . I have started a new life with my boss , Steve Jobs . He does n't need any money , but no reason to go out with him . He has always wanted to help me , but he does n't appreciate it . He loves my body ! He has always loved my mind . ''   `` Please , I repeat , please , please , you have to live with me ! ''   `` I 'm sorry . Your mind is too damaged to live with me . It will destroy you . ''   `` But I know that ! I know that ! ''   `` Steve , I know . You 're my boss . When I went to kill you , I killed you . I only killed you because I wanted to kill you . I loved you , but I did not know that life could be so cruel . ''   `` You understand why I did it ? ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I know that . You were my boss for a year . But you were also my boss for a hundred years . You killed every single one of my employees to please me . ''   `` But why ? ! Why kill me ! ''   `` Because you did n't like me ! ''   `` That 's not true ! ''   `` But you did n't like me ! ''   `` I do n't mind ! If I killed you , that would be all I needed ! ''   ``

`` Good evening officer . ''   `` Good morning , sir . ''   `` Good morning , officer . ''   `` Good morning , officer . ''   `` Good morning , officer . ''   `` Good morning , man . ''   The officer returned to his patrol vehicle . The crew had been busy getting off at the beach for an hour now . A man with blonde hair was standing out among the others , his crewmember , whose hair was long and beige . He made the appearance of a homeless man in a pair of shorts and an olympic tuxedo . The group had been drinking heavily , and they were only half way on the beach , when something happened to the officer .   He was sitting in the passenger seat , looking out the window . The officer continued ,   `` How can we not hear anything ? ''   `` The message is clear , '' the man in the blue suit answered .   `` What are we doing here ? '' the officer asked .   The man answered in an inquisitive tone . `` Do n't worry about it . It 's just the weather . They show no signs of life . ''   `` But the messages show nothing , '' the officer responded .   `` They speak English ? ''   `` Not speaking at all . They appear to be speaking in English . ''   `` We should have looked for a language like that , '' the officer replied . `` But when I looked down at his tablet , I noticed something . It had a message written in English , and yet- ''   `` Officer , not speaking in English ! '' the officer interrupted .   `` It was the message . They appeared to be speaking with us , and yet- ''   `` They have English ? '' the officer asked .   `` Yes , and yet- ''   `` Jesus Christ , I saw the message ! ''   `` No , that ca n't be it ! '' the officer said defensively .   `` Take a seat , alright ? '' the officer said . `` I 'm going to head back to our patrol car . ''   The officer left the patrol car . As he walked over to the man in blue , he quickly looked in a mirror . His face looked a bit older , but still beautiful . His hair was a little greasy , and the same face he had last Sunday afternoon . His suit was a little too long , and his face was even darker than it had been on Sunday mornings . His eyes looked a bit brighter , and his face looked a bit more wrinkly . His skin looked a bit lighter , and his ears looked a touch lighter . His nose was even , almost as if it were on fire . His eyes seemed to have no pupils . The only thing that was remarkable was his pupils .   The officer walked over to the mans front door . He opened it , and was surprised to see the man there . He was wearing a hoodie , which had been overgrown with vines , and was beginning to grow on his shoulders . He looked around the road , and at the beach , his face seemed rather familiar . He approached the man in blue , and spoke as if he was speaking to a child , as if it were in English . At first the man would flinch , then his eyes , then his feet , then his lips , and finally his eyes . He would look at the beach , and start to read the messages again , and each time , he would ask the same thing : `` Are you deaf ? ''   He also looked back at the ship 's communications officer . His eyes were as pale as the ocean , and the man in blue 's eyes read back a second time , saying `` Yes , you are . ''   The officer walked over to the mans seat and sat down , and sat at the controls of the ship . The ship began to shake slightly . The ship began to move violently around the beach . The officer walked over to the mans seat , where he sat . He looked over at the man in blue , and said , `` You are blind . You are n't going to hear anything . ''   The man in blue looked at the ship , and said , `` Yes . ''   The officer looked at the spaceship . After a few moments , the ship began to wobble slightly , seemingly out of balance . Then before he could say anything , the ship began to shake violently . The ship began to shake violently . The man in blue looked at the ship , and said , `` No , no , you are n't going to hear anything .
I sit at my desk . A piece of paper and I ca n't work out who to write . I ca n't stay like this . I need to escape . I need to find a way out . I 'm going to die .   I ca n't shake the feeling . It 's getting weird . I 'm scared . Do I feel scared ? Is this a dream ? Is this really the end ? I 'm writing all this down and I just do n't understand .   I try to read the paper again but I ca n't . I 'm scared because I ca n't think of anything else . I 'm afraid because I ca n't really think of how to escape . I 'm scared because I ca n't think of things that are n't possible . I 'm going to die . I have many questions . `` Why ca n't I die right now '' , `` Why ca n't I make it out alive ? '' , `` Why ca n't I jump out of the sky ? '' . It 's getting harder to concentrate . I 'm going to die .   `` No , '' I say out loud .   I start writing again , but I ca n't take my eyes off of the paper . I can only look back to my writing .   I begin to write again , but I ca n't take my eyes off of the paper . I can only look back to the paper . I can only stare back to the paper .   I start to write again , but I ca n't take my eyes off of the paper . I ca n't take my eyes off of the paper . I can only stare back to my writing . I can only stare back to my writing .   I start to write again , but I ca n't take my eyes off of the parchment . I can only stare back to my writing . I can only stare back to my writing .   I stop writing . I stop writing . I stop writing . I stop writing . I stop writing .   I stop writing . I stop writing . I stop writing . I stop writing .   I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I had to make it . I had to make it . I needed to make it .   The paper starts to darken and I start to feel nauseous . I ca n't take my eyes off of the paper . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it .   I feel dizzy . I feel dizzy . I feel dizzy . I feel dizzy . I feel dizzy . I do n't know how long I do n't have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it .   I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it .   I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it . I have to make it .   I lean forward . I reach around my desk and grab the gun . I load the gun .   I fire . I hear them outside , followed by silence . I open the door . I see some men . They are coming from outside . I hear some noises . They are coming from inside . I hear someone yelling . I hear some people screaming . They are coming from outside . I do n't hear them . I hear them making their way inside . I hear some people yelling . My scream rings out and I fire . I hear some people screaming . I hear some people coming around the desk . I hear some people coming out the door .   I fire again . I fire . I fire . I fire .   I hear people outside . I hear people trying to escape . I hear some people screaming . I hear a person being shouted . I hear a person being screamed .   I hear a man trying to run out of my office . I hear him trying to run . I hear another person being yelled loudly . I hear someone saying something .   I hear all of them screaming . I hear a man being yelled . I hear someone shouting . I hear someone screaming .   I hear the woman screaming . I hear a woman yelling . I hear someone screaming . I hear a man yelling . I hear someone screaming . I hear someone yelling . I hear someone yelling .   I hear someone yelling . I hear
A blade was the answer .   Henry made sure he would n't let the door creak open with a clank at his boots and the sounds of his rifle being reloaded as he climbed in . The door did n't open .   Henry threw his rifle in frustration . The boots and rifle were on the same ground . The door did n't open .   His hand came to rest on the rifle just in case . The smell of gunpowder lingered in the air . The barrel was too big for any reasonable man to ever use it .   Henry let out a long sigh . The door was on the other side of the door .   Henry walked over to the door . He set the barrel down on the ground and removed one leg from his belt . With the other leg on the table , he made sure not to let himself fall to the ground just as he did , but he could n't blame his men for their hesitation . His men were idiots . They would n't take a chance .   He was too late .   Henry closed the door , and walked to his chamber . His gun was on the other side of the door .   He looked down at it . It was n't loaded . It was n't even powered . It was just a small metal cylinder .
`` Alright , I 'm done here . Sorry , I 'll have to finish this in the morning . ''   `` I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . ''   `` OK , ok. OK , listen here . ''   `` I know you 've warned me before . ''   `` Stop it ! ''   `` I 'm coming . ''   `` I know you . ''   `` STOP IT ! ''   `` Stop it ! STOP IT ! ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` They 're not looking in , heh . ''   `` Fuck it ! ''   `` I 'm in . ''   `` They 're not looking in . ''   `` Silence . ''   `` Ohhhh ... Ohhhh . Ohuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck . '' A hand wraps around her shoulder . `` You okay ? ''   `` No , you are n't . ''   `` I 'm fine . Are n't you ? ''   `` No , I 'm not . ''   `` I 'm fine . I 'm fine . ''   `` ... Uh ... Fine . ''   `` Hi . I 'm here to make sure you 're okay . ''   `` Um . Thanks . I guess . ''   `` How are you feeling ? ''   `` Feeling , '' the ghost whispers . `` Do you like it ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` What 's that ? ''   `` I 'm just wondering . My name 's Carl , right ? ''   `` Hey ? Do n't tell me that . I 'm a ghost . ''   `` No , I do n't want to scare you . ''   `` I 'm not scared . ''   `` Look , I ca n't be a ghost . I 'm afraid of ghosts , Carl . I 'm afraid of *you* . ''   `` Oh , that 's ok , but ... I 'm not afraid of you . ''   `` You do n't know who I am . ''   `` I 'm a ghost . ''   `` A ghost ? That 's why I was here . ''   `` I can see you now , Carl . Look in your bag . You need your strength . ''   `` Uh ... Thanks . Thanks . I 'm sorry , though . ''   `` Do n't worry , Carl . Do n't worry , I was here for you . '' The ghost smiles again . `` You were here because I loved you . Do n't worry , Carl . Do n't worry . You were here for a reason . ''   `` I 'm not afraid of you . I 'm not scared of you . ''   `` Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I 'm safe . Just do n't ask questions . Please . '' Carl laughs , too . It 's a genuine laugh . But it 's also one that comes from the ghost 's own laughter .   `` You *are* safe enough because of me , Carl . ''   `` Shut up . ''   `` I *am* safe enough because *you* are safe enough . ''   `` You 're not safe enough because *you* are safe enough because *I'm* safe enough because *you* are safe enough .
Everyone is staring at the peanut butter jar in wonderment as the owner of this large metal jar slowly opens the lid .   `` Where did this come from ? '' they ask .   The owner looks around at everyone , `` Me too . Looks like this can be used in a sandwich shop . ''   Everyone else looks at the jar .   `` No it ca n't be anyone 's favorite . '' the owner adds .   Everyone and everyone turns their head to see the huge metal jar open and without a word there are five jelly sandwiches in its container . One is filled with half of it and the other three are filled with the same jelly sandwich .   Everyone looks at the one who is filled with the one who is filled with the jelly sandwich .   `` Me too . Looks like this can be used in a sandwich shop . ''   Everyone and everyone continues panicking with what is happening .   `` I wonder what they 'll do with that one . ''
`` Hey Clark . '' I paused , looking over at his son to make sure he was looking the same .   `` You alright , son ? '' he said calmly while shaking his head .   The news reporters had been covering things like this for a long time . We were only four years old , and yet we still struggled with the idea that our son , Clark Kent , had turned eighteen and gone into a business with a rich Italian woman . Why did he want to do this ?   `` I 'm fine . '' I answered , still maintaining my professional demeanor . `` Just been looking for someone else to take the time I needed . ''   There were murmurs around the room . Clark looked at me with confusion before speaking .   `` Clark , just in case , let me just think about it . You wo n't be able to do this . I 'm on my own . ''   `` Okay , okay . I just need to remind you that I love you , your own brother . ''   Bruce just looked at me with a blank expression on his face before opening his mouth to begin speaking again .   `` I love you too , Lex . ''   Then he looked away and turned to face Clark .   `` Well that 's not true . I did n't , and I 'm not sure about that anymore . I just want you to know that I love you all the same . ''   Clark 's face turned a serious shade of pale as he began to cry . It was only natural that my voice would betray my feelings towards the world .   `` I love you too , Lois . ''   The words were taken by both of us . It did not matter what happened , what we needed to do . But it did matter that we were to save our son . I would do what I could to help him . Without Superman , there was nothing to save .   `` Maybe not everyone has the same dreams , '' Clark finally spoke .   `` I know . '' I replied .   `` I know . ''   It was then that the news reporter left the room , leaving me alone in the waiting room .   `` Supes . '' He sighed and walked to the front of the room .   `` Do n't worry , son . It 'll all be over soon . ''   I looked back over at my son and noticed that he was all smiles , tears streaming down his face . He was the same age as himself , and he was very well behaved .   `` I know , '' Clark finally said .   `` Supes . '' I said .   I made my way through the main hallway of the building , past security personnel and doctors who were just like him . No one was there to see me . The only thing that mattered was that I had to save my son . We could not be the only two , not even Clark at this age .   I sighed and walked towards the front door . The building was a nice enough structure , decorated with all the little things Batman would love to come see . He had given me a place for him this time .   The entryway led into a large , ornate room , with a staircase leading upwards . Just beyond the door , there stood Clark and Lex .   `` Do n't worry , my son . You 'll be safe . '' They said .   `` But that 's why I 'm here . '' I replied .   The elevator continued to descend . Superman walked up to me and grabbed his son . He was crying as he hugged him tight .   `` Do n't worry son , '' he said . `` I 'll be fine . ''   As I looked down at my son , I saw a small tear drop down his cheek . He had not cried on the first day .   Kryptonite and Lex did not look alike , but they were both beautiful and special .   Clark gripped Lex tightly , and we walked to the front of the room .   Within moments , the doors were unlocked , and I saw Clark and Lex holding each other tightly , their eyes fixed on the man on the other side of the door .   `` What the hell are you doing ? ! '' Clark demanded .   `` Saving my son ! '' Superman yelled , reaching inside his coat .   `` Get your hands away from him Superman ! '' Kryptonite screamed .   I looked back at my son and saw in his eyes that
`` Tell me , dear . ''   The little girl , no kid , was sitting on the other side of the bed .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She wore a soft , brown dress . It was her favorite . She had always wanted to be a God . She had always been an atheist .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She sat up , holding out her hands and asking the question . She had never been asked that before .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She looked up at him and smiled . He did n't seem to notice something . He simply stared at her . Nothing . He slowly got his head around her and pulled her closer .   She shivered .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She did n't respond .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She looked back up and smiled .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She nodded . She did n't know what to say .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She looked at him . He did n't look at her . In fact , he did n't look at her .   Her eyes opened wide . She thought of what she wanted to tell him . She thought of what she wanted to be .   She looked back up at him and smiled . She looked at the ceiling .   And then she looked back up . And so did he . Then he looked down at her . His brow furrowed .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She looked up .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She looked down at him . Her face was still warm . The blanket lay over her as she stood up . And she looked down at her feet . Her feet began to move . The child started to walk forward .   She looked up at him . He did n't look at her . His eyes were still closed . His eyes were still closed .   She looked up at him . He did n't look at her . She reached out for his hand . And he held her .   He did n't seem to notice anything . He simply stared at her . Nothing . He slowly got up and began to walk around her .   She shivered .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   He did n't seem to notice anything . He just stared at her . Nothing . He slowly got up and started to walk around her .   She shivered .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   He did n't seem to notice anything . He just stared at her . Nothing . He slowly got up and started to walk around her . She looked up at him . She looked up at him . He just stared at her . His eyes were still closed .   She looked up at him . He did n't seem to notice anything . He just stared at her . His eyes were still closed .   She shivered .   `` Tell me , dear . ''   She looked up at him . He did n't seem to notice anything . He just stared at her . His eyes were still closed . His eyes were still closed .   She looked up at him . He was n't really looking at her . He just stared at her . Her eyes were still closed .   She looked up at him . He was n't really looking at her . He was simply looking at her . Her eyelids closed . Her eyelid opened wider . Her eyelid opened wider . Her eyelids closed wider . Her eyelid opened wider . Her eyelid opened wider .   She felt her body begin grow cold .   She opened her eyes .   She looked up at him .   And she saw him .   He was staring at her . She was staring at him .   She felt her body begin to pulse . This was n't right . This was n't right . She felt her body begin to go cold . She began to fall backwards . She felt herself begin to break apart . She felt her body begin to fall forward . This was n't right . This was n't right . She felt herself begin to succumb to the cold . She felt her body begin to shake uncontrollably . This was n't right . She felt herself begin to burn . She opened her eyes . She opened her eyes . She opened them . She did
`` How is it going ? ''   `` Nothing , it 's just great . ''   `` We 'll talk about it ? ''   `` Yeah , that sounds great , I 'll read the paper tomorrow . ''   `` Yeah , that sounds great . ''   `` The paper was right , you know , I like it , it 's not really the same , I mean , if we 're going to listen to you , I have to be able to enjoy the things we see and enjoy all the things we hear and enjoy . I really like the fantasy of fantasy , there are so many fantastic places in the world and somehow even the best of those people are where you can get and get and enjoy some happiness instead of doing it everyday 's not like all of us really want to have one another . ''   `` That 's right , I 'll read the paper tomorrow . ''   `` Well , I 'm not going to read it all tomorrow , you know , just look at the world and enjoy it . ''   `` No , I ca n't , I ca n't , I ca n't , it 's so quiet and eerie and I 'm all alone in existence and here I am in this world and it 's like ... ''   `` I do n't understand , now listen to me , I have to write this . ''   The sound of another click and the phone rang . The phone was gone , with a click it seemed to have disconnected before the other guy actually picked it up . The phone then rang again , and again , until it rang again and again , until it rang again and again until it rang again and again until it rang again and again and again until it rings again and again until it rang again and again until it rang again and again until it rang again and again until it rang once more and again until it rang and again until it rang again and again until it rang again and again and again and again until it rang and again and again until it rang endlessly until it rang twice and again until it rang relentlessly until it rang out and again and again until it rang relentlessly until it rang once more and he picked up the phone and picked it up and placed it on the table and placed it over his mouth and wiped his teary eyes from his face and said , `` Look , I 'm going to drive this to work and I have a long day tomorrow . Yours is very much appreciated . ''
Somewhere , I was waiting . For the light . As I turned toward the other side of the bar , I caught a glimpse of the tattoos on my wrist . I knew it was him . He 'd just come out . But there was so much more he could do .   I gave a smile . I loved working in the Department , but after what felt like hours , I knew right away I was no longer going to be able to get away . I turned back towards the bar .   `` Hey , pal . I 'll be right back with you . ''   He nodded and walked away . I needed to get my stuff back home . But something was wrong . I was n't ready for this . I needed to go to the store . I needed to get back to my wife . This world should n't end like this .   Before I left the bar , I could hear him walk down the street . The red lights were changing . I was going to have to wait a while longer . He would come back soon .   The next day , I drove up to the store and found the other guy in scrubs . One of the guys , a short-haired , brunette , was crying . He noticed the scars on my wrist and approached me .   `` Wow , lady . You 're such a brave dude , '' he said .   `` I 'm glad you came to visit me , '' I said `` The shop is bustling with people from all over the world . ''   `` Forgive the boy , '' he said , `` But I have the scars right here . I 'm not dead yet . ''   I reached into my pocket and pulled out a knife . I started to slice him .   `` How have you been ? '' he asked .   `` I 've been going to work for a while now , '' I replied . `` My wife was amazing , and she made all sorts of promise for me . I just needed to get home . ''   `` What ? '' he asked .   I started cutting him .   `` That 's the last bit of kindness I 've gotten right away , since I got the scar . ''   The man stopped hurting and looked into his eyes . No more tears . He was gone .   I ran into the room , and grabbed my knife , wondering what had happened . But no matter how many times , it always came back empty . There was n't a trace of him . No point in trying to get out of bed anytime soon . Instead though , I threw the knife in the closet .   I grabbed the handle of the knife and swung it open . I walked into the main store . The place was so bright . I had to see somewhere . I walked in slowly . The bright lights were getting brighter .   I fell to my knees . My hands were red . I was bleeding . I looked around . I was facing the mirror . My skin was pale and pale . I was covered in scars . I fell to my knees .   Next to me , a young woman , maybe 10 years old , walked past . She grabbed my hands tightly .   `` Hey ! '' She called .  Her face was so familiar : bright red , with a scar above her left eye .   `` Hi , '' I said . `` Can I help you ? ''   She shook her head .   `` I made a promise to do it , '' she said . `` I 'm telling you , I was supposed to do it . ''   `` Do you mean , do you realize what this meant ? ''   `` Of course I do , '' she said . `` I took my wife 's promise on me . Now I have to go . ''   I broke down in tears .   `` I promise , '' she said . `` I promise to do it . ''   `` Okay , so what 's your promise ? ''   `` I promise to carry out my dreams , '' she replied , `` I promise to see the stars in peace before I die . ''   I could n't say anything else . She was gone . This was Hell .
I had done it . I had succeeded .   No one could see . No one could hear .   Every person who had not been sleeping for centuries or even a century was dead . Nobody was safe in this world . It would be over , and the first living humans on earth would be dead .   When I first opened the hibernation capsule , nobody reacted . They all laughed and laughed at me , but they were n't scared . They were afraid of something , something that had stopped all of these years .   The years that passed would be unbearable , and I would not be able to do anything . But I knew .   And I also knew what was going to happen .   I was a living man . Of all people to live , who had never slept in a hundred years , I was most certainly the greatest .
The alarm went off . `` Go to sleep , mom '' I was telling myself .   I woke up at 4PM , not unlike the clock on the wall . I had a hangover , but I was not a bad person after all .   `` Mom ! '' I yelled as I dashed to my room .   `` Mom ! '' the alarm chirped again . `` Go to sleep , sweetie ''   I rushed outside , getting ready for the day . I could see the city ahead . I was very proud of the small town I lived in . There had been many such cities at the time .  Before long I had made it to the city , to the very city of New York .   The city I lived on was very much the same . The buildings were nearly identical , but they were also in different languages .   All the people who lived there lived in different countries . Some were a bit more British , others were fluent , but most did not speak English .   I walked towards my room , looking around .  `` Mom ... '' I said . `` Open my eyes ''   She nodded , her beautiful smile slowly fading as she opened her eyes .   Everything went black .   I woke up to a cold sweat on my forehead . I got up and got dressed .   I walked down a hallway , feeling a stab of pain on my abdomen . I had lived a good life . But I was not a nice person .   I decided to go down the hallway and pick up my phone . My wife told me this is my funeral .   I left the house as fast as I could . I walked towards our house . It was a small house , close to 10 foot by 10 foot wide .   I approached the yard and saw a light reflecting off the walls .   `` Good morning , John '' I said .   `` Good morning , Mom ? '' I asked .   `` Good morning , John '' she replied .   `` Good morning , Mom ? '' I asked again .   `` Good morning , Dad ! '' I yelled .   `` Good morning , John ! '' I yelled back .   My wife walked into the room and smiled at me .   Without saying goodbye , I walked away , leaving her crying .
The rover had been in the process of completing the first manned mission in history . We could hear the creak of the shovel . It was old ; in some places it was still fresh . The suit was as old as it had ever been . There was a hole in the ground where the earth once was , but we knew the drill was still there . All of us stood there , watching .   The human body could n't have been more than three feet long , but the impact had put a pressure on it . All of us knew that it was bad news , and that we had to watch the last humans get to the ground . We did exactly as we were told to watch . We waited .   The impact had knocked the suit off the ground . The suit was still there . We watched .   Eventually , after several minutes , the rest of the body started to move again . It was like watching a movie , a whole new concept altogether . We sat there .   The astronauts and the shovels began to move again , but they remained quiet . Eventually , one of them started to say something .   `` Hello , '' they said , `` I was hoping you were able to find our location before we left the Earth . I do n't know how long you 've been doing this , but do n't worry about it . I 'm perfectly safe on this rock . ''   I frowned . We usually avoided the questions , but this had been a first step in years . The human body had definitely died .   `` I see . '' The shovels lowered . It was n't a long story . The capsule opened . Inside it were four large metal arms , and a shovel with a hole in the ground .   `` I see you 're gone , '' the human said , stepping outside the capsule . `` You and I will be spending the rest of eternity together . ''   `` Yes , thank you , '' I replied . I kept walking .
As I watched my wife die , I realized that I was wrong .  I loved her , I loved her .   It was her who died .   I was killed by her .   I loved her .   She was my own daughter .   I loved her .   But death is not life .  She is .   My arms shook , fists clenched , fists clenched , fists clenched .   I cried .   I did everything I could .   My smile , my sorrow , my joy .   I screamed .   But I could not .   She did not .   She was my own daughter .   She was innocent .   No one else knew .   As I watched her die , I realized that I was wrong .   My arms shook , fists clenched .   I loved her .   I was killing her .   But death is not life .  She was my own daughter .   I was killer .   I was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   I loved her .   But death is not life .  She was my own daughter .   I loved her .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   I loved her .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   And I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   I killed her .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was her wife .   I loved her .   She was my own daughter .   Her father was her wife .   I loved her .   I loved her .   The sound of metal on metal echoed all around .   My sister .   My daughter .   I was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   I loved her .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   She was my own daughter .   The sound of metal on metal echoed all around .   My sister .   Tears fell on my cheeks .   I looked down at the broken shards of my sister 's skull .   I wiped them away with a piece of cloth .   I stood up .   I walked over to my daughter .   She looked at me .   I had gone through her life .   She was my own daughter .   I was dead .
`` Sir , there *is* a robbery at the bank ! ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` I DO N'T KNOW , IT WAS JUST A PERSON ! ''   `` But why would you show up ? You told me to get here and work , I told you to do this and now- ''   `` What the hell are you doing ? ''   `` I 'm robbing this bank ! It 's like I was standing on a cliff ! ''   `` So you 're telling me to not rob the bank ? ''   `` No sir , it 's just a fucking person ! ''   `` All right then , what the hell are you doing here ? ''   `` I 'm taking my phone out of my pocket and I need it to call 911 , now that I 'm here , I wo n't be using it ! ''   `` What is it ?

`` Oh my God ! '' Said Johnny . The man cackled derisively . Johnny dropped to his knees .   `` What are you doing here ? '' Johnny asked .   The man smiled , `` Oh , you are here for your reward . '' He began to kneel down , hands resting on Johnny 's knees . They looked like they were in a boxing match , but this time it was different .   This time Johnny spoke up , `` So , what 's your plan ? ''   `` Well , I do n't really need to beat you anyway . You might also just want to stay safe . We can get out of here and finish this fight . ''   `` What about you , then ? Are you really going to kill me ? ''   Johnny nodded , `` Not really . I just want to put myself through some pain and ... to see you again . ''
`` I 'm so sorry , '' Kevin says . `` But I had better get some rest . ''   `` No , '' Janice says , grabbing a glass of water and a handful of granola bars before heading to the kitchen . `` I wo n't miss you . ''   `` What ? '' Kevin asks , looking at his watch . It 's two o'clock in the morning , and it 's time to leave . They 're late , and he 'll be late for something . Janice grabs her coat and walks out of the door . *It 'd be so easy* , Kevin thinks to himself . He 'd been so close to her , and now he always assumed she was the one .   He stops at the grocery store before walking up to what looks like a woman 's uniform . `` How are you today Janice ? ''   `` Can I ask you something like , uh , what is your name ? ''   `` Oh , I 'm Janice . ''   `` When do you come from ? ''   `` I need to go home , I do n't know . ''   `` Well , I do n't know anything about you . I just came from New York . ''   `` No , no , no , no . '' Janice says , looking around the room .   `` I-I came from New York ! Is that where you live ? ''   `` No , not yet . I guess it 's a hotel , or maybe something . It 's really nice , actually . ''   `` It 's not like it 's anything fancy . I just came from New York , and you know what I mean ? ''   `` No , no , no , no ! '' Janice says . `` It 's a hotel . I 'm from New York . Look around , Kevin ! ''   `` I ... ? ''   `` Wait . What ? ''   `` Look . I need to go home . Take care of that . ''   Kevin ignores her advice .   She comes back into the store , and pulls a cup of water . `` What 's going on here ? ''   `` I needed to get some rest , '' Kevin said . `` And I actually came from New York . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` Well , I see you and I am on a plane all the time . I need to go home soon . ''   `` Right . Right . ''   `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I-I do n't know . No , I just came from New York . Do n't worry about it , Janice . It 's just- ''   `` Where will you be going , Kevin ? '' Janice cuts him off .   `` I do n't know , Janice . ''   `` No , Kevin . It 's just a hotel . You need to go home . ''   `` And where will you be going , ? ''   `` I do n't know . I do n't know anything about you . I just came from New York . ''   `` Do n't be cruel , Kevin . I 've come from New York and I ca n't go home . ''   `` I do n't know , Janice . ''   `` You want to go home ? ''   `` No , I just- ''   `` I do n't care what you say ! I know what you mean ! ''   `` You want to go home ? ''   `` I do n't know ! I just came from New York and I do n't know anything about you ! ''   `` I wo n't leave ! ''   Janice walks back inside , and grabs something from the counter . `` Please , Janice . ''   Kevin picks up a small black box with a label on it , and opens it . `` May I have your name ? ''   `` Janice . ''   `` Yes ? ''   Janice shakes her head . `` I 'm gon na call the police . I 'm gon na call the FBI immediately . ''   Kevin looks back at Janice and then back at the box . `` I do n't want you to worry about it . ''   Janice turns to the car , and
I 've been hiding in the woods for long enough that I do not question what is outside . A silhouette is looming over me , and I am ready to show it my face . I do not need to hide . My heart is beating fast , and I know what it is . The silhouette is coming out of the dark , and I am preparing to leave . It is coming closer . I have to leave now . I know what it is . I 'll show it my face .   It is so close now , and it does not hesitate . I am ready . I am ready for it to come .   It slowly begins to walk toward me , and I am ready . I am ready . I can feel my heart beating faster , and I am ready .   It slowly passes me by , and I am ready . I am ready .   This is the first time I have ever made a mistake .
The world was dying . I still remembered my first day at work . I walked into the office and there was a group of people . They looked me in the eyes and said , `` Take a seat and let us begin . '' I was the only one with a seat ; the other three were all well and good working men . `` So our new religion is just religion . '' I asked . `` Oh yes , yeah . '' They all agreed . We all walked out of the office , leaving two of the men behind ; I looked up from my office and saw a strange looking man standing in the middle of the room . The man was tall and in a business suit with hair and a clipboard in one hand and a clipboard in the other . He pointed at me with the clipboard and said `` Hello , please enter the new religion . '' After the man said that I looked up and saw a strange man sitting next to me . He was dressed in a suit with a clipboard in the other . He motioned to me .   `` Sit here . '' I began . He stared at me for several moments and then said , `` We have a new religion . '' I looked at him with a confused look on my face . He just smiled . `` Indeed ! '' Another man stood up and said , `` You take a seat . '' The man started with an excited laugh . `` Well then , we must take back the religion . '' I looked at him in confusion and said , `` How can I have another religion now ? '' I took a seat and he took a seat with a blank expression on his face . `` We are just religion . '' He said with a smug sly grin . `` And you are our new religion . '' The man started to walk away . `` You may answer my question and your religion will start again . '' I paused a second for a moment . `` Yes , yes '' I said , `` I believe that we will be using our new religion as our own . '' I then looked out of the window . The world was dying ; I still remember my first day at work .
`` You are new to this class , you will be studying something called 'my old world . ' Right now the reason you have n't found an interesting planet is because you did n't get that much attention from the rest of the class . ''   The headmaster looked down at the board , who just shrugged .   `` What is the purpose of that ? ''   The headmaster 's eyes twitched , but he quickly kept his gaze fixed upon the board .   `` Well ... '' he started , `` It appears that the last time you noticed why you 're here , that 's when an animal broke into your house . ''   `` I would n't call that a creature , sir ! '' said the student in a nervous tone .   `` Okay , so if you wanted to start with humans you would also need to learn that they are an aggressive species . ''   `` Uh , why not ? ''   Themaster gestured through the student 's glasses . `` Well , it appears that the creature is trying to rob you from your home , and you 're not very smart to deal with it . ''   The student took a moment to look around the room awkwardly . `` So do you plan on joining me ? ''   `` No , sir . ''   `` Excellent ! '' The headmaster spoke up . `` Thank you for your time , I know I 've written this a bit on my phone , but please do n't be rude . ''   The student pointed at the headmaster , as if it were some sort of test , `` No , sir ! Today it stands out ! Even as an animal , humans are far too dangerous to be allowed to live under our roof ! ''   `` Please , sir ! I ca n't do this , no matter how many times this happens ! '' The headmaster shouted out , slamming the desks back on their own accord .   `` No , sir ! Please , just leave ! ''   The student looked at his watch , which was slowly tickering away . `` 11:53 . ''   `` Excellent ! ''   The headmaster quickly got up and left the room , leaving the students to their own devices . After a few minutes , they were suddenly grabbed by the professor and thrown onto the roof . As they were dragged away , the headmaster said , `` Have a nice day ! ''   As he left , he smiled to himself .
I was waiting at the other end of the line to make sure I was all that I could find .   `` Sir , we need to make haste to the hospital . ''   `` Not right now , John . It 's not going to be long . ''   I heard a bit of panic . It could n't be true . I was far from safe . I knew what it was . A woman had been diagnosed schizophrenic shortly before I was born . My mother was the only one alive , and the only one who was not a part of the family . I was the only one who understood much about what was happening . I was never given a chance to be with my family . I had seen them on TV and talked to them , but I never had the chance to experience it .   In my life I had never thought about what was happening to me . I had thought of my mother , my girlfriend , even my beloved wife . `` Why am I here ? '' I asked myself . Did I really want to die ? But what if I did n't want to be with my family ?   The men on the phone sounded a bit like they were saying something . `` We need surgery . The patient is terminal . Dr. Peter Robinson will be there shortly . He has suffered mild shock and has been on the verge of recovery . He will have been fine . ''   `` No , it 's not that . I-I have n't thought about that . ''   `` No , it 's not that . It 's that . Dr. Robinson will be there shortly . He is fully conscious . He is in pain and is suffering from the same condition . The doctor will be there shortly . ''   My heart skipped a beat , and I began to panic . What if that nurse was real ? My mother is also insane . I had never thought about that . It was all some conspiracy , but it was true . The hospital had no idea what was happening , and none of the doctors talked to them . The only thing that mattered was where Doc Robinson was .   I finally managed to walk to the door and knock on it .   Nothing .   `` Sir ? ''   `` John H . Robinson ? Please come in . ''   I opened the door and a man in a suit with glasses and glasses sat waiting outside .   `` Is n't it ... uh , hello ? ''   I looked at him . He looked an awful lot like my mom . `` Hi , John . ''   I looked up at him and realized that he was n't standing in *that* room . He was n't sitting right in front of me .   `` I thought you were there . ''   `` Excuse me ? ''   `` Listen to me . I need your help . ''   I looked at him . He was n't wearing his sunglasses . He knew my mother . He was n't in the hospital anymore .   `` You do n't understand . Just tell me ... you do n't . ''   `` Yes . But you ca n't take us to the hospital . We are the ones who will be here . ''   `` Please . Please . Please . ''   `` Get out of my face . I could n't do this . I 'm not going to die . ''   `` I ca n't . I 'll be dying . I will be alive . I 'll be alive . ''   He looked at me . Tears ran down his face . `` Please . Please . ''   `` I 'll be okay . ''   `` Please , John . ''   `` Please . Please . ''   `` Please ! PLEASE ! Please . ''   `` Please . ''   `` Please . Please . ''   Suddenly , I felt strong . It felt like I could control my body . My heart was beating as hard as I was . My eyes were burning . My skin was burning . Somehow , I could control my organs .   I ran towards the other end of the line when the ambulance was making its way to the hospital . I ran until I got to the other end of the line . I ran until everything was dark and I was no longer there . I screamed until God stopped me .
'It 's not like he 's got any other option . ' Shouted the officer .   'What about you ? Or did you not have anything to offer ? '   'Telling the truth . ' Replied the officer while walking away .   'I can assure you sir , his health is quite good . He 's been through all of this . '   'So what do you think he 'll do now ? ' With that she began walking away .   'He 'll begin walking away from here . '   She arrived at the abandoned town . There were no windows to illuminate the streets , nor any people to help . There were no signs of car damage or any sign of life .   She picked up the pace , and finally approached the front door .   'Come on , it 'll take almost a minute for me to get in . If you do n't leave soon you 'll be a dead man . '   She opened the door and saw that there was a rotting body on the floor .   She opened it and saw two large men . One wore a long spear that had a piece of golden chain around it , while the other wore a cloak .   Upon further inspection the two men had a small axe in their hands .   'Alright then , we 'll break in , I 'll show you the address we have got . '   The two men walked out of the room and began to walk home . The two were close to breaking up . As they walked the two men reached a big wooden door .   As they stepped in the door of the house , they began to see a large collection of books .   'Oh , I 'm so sorry about that . When you 're 18 , you 'll be able to complete the one-hundredth book series ! ' yelled the two men .   As they walked away , the two men realized . They had to run away from the house before it was caught up in the chaos that was unfolding .
I hate the taste of sweet cookies . I hate the taste of stale bread and the smell of stale wine . I hate the taste of chocolate butter and the smell of chocolate milk on my tongue . I hate the taste of chocolate cookies and the smell of scottish pudding on the kitchen tiles . I hate the smell of stale bread and the smell of stale wine and the taste of scottish pudding on the kitchen tile . These things do n't even matter anymore . I hate my life , the way things have turned out .   One day I find myself in a hospital bed . It was a simple white room . The nurses were all sitting around the table . It was a normal day . The doctor was looking at me with a concerned look on his face . I wondered how long they were there . I wondered if I could ever be with them . I wondered if I could ever be with them .   `` Dr. Kinkwell , '' said the Doctor . `` You 're in a coma . ''   `` But it 's my birthday , '' I replied . `` And I need to spend the last twenty-three years with you . ''   `` Are you sure you want to spend the last twenty-three years with us , Dr. Kinkwell ? '' asked the Doctor .   `` Yes , '' I responded . `` But this whole procedure has been a pain . ''   `` What happens if you spend the last four hours with us ? ''   `` I 'm not sure , '' I replied . `` But my wife and I will always be with you every single day . Even last night . Even then , I feel like it 's time for me to go get a drink . ''   The doctor sighed , and looked at me , then went back to his newspaper . I was about to stand up . I had been sitting at the dinner table for twenty-three years now . I was still in a coma . I was still so confused that I did n't even realize I had been crying . I sat next to my wife about five minutes later .   `` Thank goodness you 're here , '' said my wife . `` You 're alive , now . ''   `` Yes , '' I replied . `` I am . ''   `` I am . ''   I looked at my wife , then at my wife again . She looked at me again and I felt bad for her . She looked at the doctor , then back at my wife .   `` Look , '' she said , finally . `` I just do n't want to waste my time with you anymore . I just want to spend my last twenty-three years with you . ''   `` I 'm sorry , '' I said , finally . `` I just want you to spend my last twenty-three years with us . ''   The doctor chuckled . `` Oh , no , no , no , no , '' he said . `` Are you sure you want to spend all of your time with us ? ''   `` Yes , '' I replied . `` I just want you to spend your last thirty-three years with me . ''   `` I ca n't do this , '' said the doctor . `` It 's just ... it 's just ... I know I should n't have married you anymore . ''   `` I 'm not sure , '' I replied . `` I know you should n't have married me anymore . ''   `` I love you , '' said the doctor . `` Please , do n't marry me ! ''   I walked over to my wife 's bedside table , and sat down at it . She looked at me , then at my wife again . Then and finally at my wife again . And then at my wife again . And then at the doctor 's table . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at my wife again . And then at my wife again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at my wife again . And then at my wife again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then at the doctor 's table once more . And then at the doctor 's table again . And then before I knew
The walls were lined with gold . I had never seen such a wondrous substance in my entire life . There was even a sword and shield that shone brighter than any other .   I had never seen such a metal object .   I had never heard such a weapon even if it was an enchanted artifact .   I was only 20 years old when the Great Hall had opened . My Grandfather had given me a very special gift .   The sword , unlike any other , was covered in gold and decorated in symbols that were etched into the metal . The words `` One day , you will stand firm '' had been etched onto the sword .   The sword was adorned in intricate patterns . It had single , ornate handles with intricate designs around the blade .   `` What will you do with it , my child ? '' my grandfather asked . I shook my head . `` You must destroy it and become a warrior . ''   `` I will create a weapon that can replace anything before me . '' I replied . I was very tired of being under the same rules in the past .   After 20 years of making this weapon , I had finally decided to create a weapon that would stop me from killing anyone .   I stood there in shock for a moment . `` My greatpa , '' I said . `` Please help me . I can not leave the sword behind . I will destroy it and become a warrior . ''   My Grandfather had heard me saying this before . It was not his turn to ask .   I took out my staff and stepped into the hall . I had a small sword that was at my hip now . I approached the sword and the engravings on the sword began to darken .   I heard my Grandfather say , `` Do not be afraid . ''   I quickly pulled the sword from myself . I walked over to the sword and saw the engravings on the handle .   I turned their blade and saw them .   `` You have made many strong warriors , Your greatpa . But I am no warrior . I am only a shield , my mind . Without it , I would no longer exist . '' I said . I walked back over to the sword and was shocked . It was not what I had expected .   `` Those were the Sword 's words '' my dad said to me . I looked down at the sword and saw that it was glowing brighter than any other sword . I looked again at the engravings that began to darken .   I looked at the sword and saw that it was also glowing brighter than anything I had ever seen .   `` You left the sword behind because of what you have done to others . '' I commanded my father .   His eyes widened and he looked surprised . `` Yes , my child . Those were the Sword 's words and the engravings on the sword began to darken . ''   My Grandfather shook his head . `` Your greatpa , you must destroy everything before you become a warrior . You must destroy everything before you become a warrior . ''   I felt myself start to lose it . I reached the sword and could hardly put it together . I began to feel the blade and the engravings on the sword begin to darken .   `` Your greatpa , you must destroy everything before you become a warrior. `` I heard my Grandfather 's words and the engravings disappeared .   `` You will destroy everything before you become a warrior . You will destroy everything before you become a warrior. `` I heard my Grandfather 's words and the engravings disappeared .   Then I looked at my sword .   I felt something that was hard to describe .   It was made of polished stone . My Grandfather looked over to me and started to cry .   `` My child , my greatpa . I am so sorry . '' He said to me . He looked at the sword and saw that it was glowing brighter than anything I had ever seen .   `` I just wish you would understand '' he whispered to my sister . `` I hate you . ''   I looked at my sword . It was a magnificent iron sword and the engravings on the sword were glowing brighter than any other sword . I looked at my Grandfather 's sword .   `` It is not worth fighting . '' I said . `` It is worth killing for . ''   He looked at my sword slowly . I stared at the blade and saw that the engravings were glowing brighter than anything I had ever seen .   Then he looked
In the twilight I could feel the heat of the sun rising up overhead . I could hear the birds outside , enjoying the sights and sounds of the world . I watched as the stars shone bright and twinkled , illuminating the vast expanse of the sky . I stared at the clouds , imagining the colors they would seem to have , even if they were n't .   Suddenly I heard a sound behind me . I turned , and saw a large ball of light pouring down over the clouds . It seemed to be coming from inside the ball of light . I looked down to see a man in front of me . I could see something coming from his mouth , but I was unable to make out what it was . He kept staring at the clouds , not having noticed my expression .   Then I saw him . He stood , shaking his head . The man who was shaking his head disappeared , and I saw him again . He leaned against the wall with his hands out in front of him . He looked across the room toward the sky , where he saw the ball of light shining through the clouds . He put his head back down onto his feet , and closed his eyes .   Then I knew that I was n't alone anymore .
I stared at the figure in front of me in the mirror , taking in everything . I had always found it hard to sleep at night . In fact , during the day I woke up on the dot and dreamed I was imagining things . My dream suddenly came true . I saw it today . The first thing I saw was myself , my reflection , standing over me with my hands clasped behind my back .   `` Are you sure this is n't some kind of trick ? After all , I had nothing to do with you . '' I said .   `` No , I 'm definitely dreaming . Please , I ca n't get some water for you . ''   `` You lied to me . I ca n't drink water . ''   `` You lied to me , too ! I just needed some water ! ''   `` Please , you lied to me ! I did n't do anything . ''   `` You lied to you ! Do n't be so rude ! ''   `` I did n't mean to do anything ! I just wanted to be with you , you know ? '' I shouted and pointed at my hands .   `` Do n't act like you 're lying ! I love you ! I like you ! ''   `` No , do n't act like you 're lying . I know you love me . ''   `` Yes , yes . ''   I pulled the water out of my pocket , and began to pour myself a drink . I was confused and confused , but I was really thirsty . I looked at my hands again and picked up the water . I saw myself standing over me with my hands behind my back , drinking it all out . I looked at the figure in front of me in the mirror , take in everything . I had always found it hard to sleep at night . In fact , during the day I woke up in the morning with my hands clasped behind my back . 
I stood here , frozen in place . I had a choice : make time travel possible or even just end it . I made it through the doorway .    * '' Time travel ... . '' *    The words came out of my mouth , and into my mind . There he was . I stood with my gun , listening . He seemed to understand , but not quite .    `` Where did I put your head ? ''    He said , `` I did , officer . ''    * '' I should 've said * '' I should have said * '' And what ? `` *    He said , `` In time , '' as he pulled the trigger . Suddenly , a blue light filled my vision . I was in a room with a tall stone staircase , a window , and a desk , surrounded by a desk . There was a sign outside that read , * '' DO NOT TOUCH THE BULLET '' *    I stood there . I took a deep breath , and walked down the staircase .    * '' Where did I put my head ? `` *
`` Do you think we really were the first explorers of Mars ? ''   `` No , sir . We were the first explorers of Mars . ''   `` What did you even say that meant ? ''   `` It meant , *I know ! * Our mission plan was set to be 100,000 years forward . ''   `` That is highly unlikely . ''   `` But do you think we would have been any different ? What if the mission was different ? What if we were already doomed ? ''   `` Sir , we 'd have learned something to do the rest of the time . ''   `` What difference does this make ? ''   `` It changes who would be the first to discover Mars . ''   `` But then why would anything change ? How would we live ? ''   `` We 'd see it through the telescopes . Maybe we 'd try to find out why . Maybe we 'd be able to prove we were n't human . ''   `` But we 've just tried to prove that we were different . We 're not even human . ''   `` He 's right . *I* am very human . And I think we 're the easiest path we 've ever been on . ''   `` But the last time we walked on Mars , we made a mistake . We were the last human alive . Why would anyone want this ? ''   `` Sir , there were 10,000 of us earlier that month . ''   `` 10,000 ? ''   `` It felt like a whole century . ''   `` Oh . ''   `` 100,000 years ago , we made a mistake . ''   `` What kind of mistake did we make ? ''   `` We were going to be the first explorers of Mars . ''   `` Oh , but sir , there were 10,000 of us . ''   `` What ? ''   `` 10,000 years ago , we made a mistake . ''   `` That 's not fair how far we 've gone . ''   `` Oh , but it still worked . ''   `` You saw that when you were older , and now you 're twenty years old . ''   `` We did n't ! ''   `` Because we had hundreds of us . ''   `` How many of us ? ''   `` Two thousand . ''   `` And how many of us did you make ? ''   `` I , uh , I do n't know . ''   `` Did you find anything ? ''   `` I think so . ''   `` And when that day comes , we 're going to die or something ? ''   `` No , sir . ''   `` Maybe life goes on . ''   `` Not really . ''   `` You did . ''   `` Oh , that 's a sad , bad idea . ''   `` I guess it should , thank you . ''   `` Thank you for everything . ''
`` What the fuck , man ? '' I say , barely more interested in the ruckus of his pants than the question of why John had taken this long to find out . `` What 's this shit ? ''   John glances at his watch . 4:30 . `` I do n't know . Like , really have no idea what this thing is . ''   I sigh . `` It 's in a pocket , too . ''   John presses a button on his watch . It flickers to life .   `` Hey , '' I say , pushing a button on the side , `` what 's this place ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Aw shit , '' John says , looking up from his pocket , `` what the fuck ? ! ''   `` I hear you . ''   `` I hear you , too . ''   I pull out my phone and try again . `` Oh shit . '' I say , trying again . `` Did I say something wrong ? ! ''   John looks at it . It flickers to life . `` No . I said we come to Metropolis tomorrow . ''
A few times I was n't responding to anything , but often I considered the prompt 's `` no more than one of thousands '' , rather than a one-page response to an interesting [ prompt ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/59rq6c/wp_you_find_a_person_that_has_power_you_find_as_at/csgxfe ) response . I think about it a lot often and it serves to reassure me that you have something better to show for yourself than the rest : )   As for the story itself , I feel like it 's a bit rushed . As far as I know , I like the idea and felt like the story would be a little more rushed , but it 's my opinion on whether or not they work together .
`` Well there , '' she said . `` It 's pretty standard . ''   I nodded in agreement .   `` What is it ? ''   `` A box . It 's pretty standard . ''   `` A box ? ''   `` Sort of . It 's like a box . ''   `` Is that why it 's here ? '' I asked .   `` What 's my name ? ''   `` Just named . ''   `` Who ? ''   `` Just called . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` She was pretty standard . ''   `` Why ?

There 's a reason as to why the world is so different . I have felt peace for a long time . The memories and images of family I held are mine .   I can always remember that first day it started . I stayed home just as the sun was beginning to peek over the horizon , and she was just standing there waiting for me there . The most beautiful woman I 've ever had the pleasure of having .   I did n't notice her until I heard screams . As I looked up to the sky , I saw a beam of light piercing through the fog that I had blanketed so much . As it consumed me , I noticed that there was a great storm brewing outside . I could n't move , and the tears that had shed were already dripping down into my eyes . I took in everything so quickly I could n't process what I 'd just experienced . I could n't feel anything .   I saw this city burn from the inside , and I felt like I had lost everything .   I laid with her , and I remember all of this without even knowing . That 's when I heard it .   `` Mommy ! Momma ! Please , let 's go ! ''   I looked up , and saw a beautiful girl in a beautiful red dress with golden hair and soft purple skin . There was a long line of blood on her dress . I wanted to cry for her .   I grabbed her hand and held it gently , and felt the tears flow down my face .   As I pulled her close , I could finally understand what she was thinking .   At once , I took in everything .   As I closed my eyes , I felt a terrible feeling . The pain slowly began spreading over me . I felt pain and sadness . I opened my eyes and ran as fast as I could .   I could n't move . I could n't feel anything .   I just could n't move . I could n't feel anything .   There was a large flash of light overhead and a huge beam of lightning collided with my face as it hit the ground . I felt the light searing my eyes . My vision blurred , and I was blinded by darkness for a long time .   The light returned immediately to me , blinding me for a long time . I opened my eyes once more , and did n't see anything that I would 've expected . It was almost sad , but somehow comforting . I still felt empty . I found myself back in my home . I opened my eyes once more , and saw a bright light .   I felt something wet on my cheek . I looked down to see a large puddle of red blood underneath my shirt . I shook my head and wiped it .   I looked down at myself , and felt a terrible feeling . I felt pain through my body and it was like I was losing everything . But , because of this , I was happy .   I looked up at the sky , and saw the beautiful girl in a beautiful red dress with golden hair and soft purple skin . There was a long line of blood on her dress . I could n't feel anything anymore .   I just could n't get away . I just could n't escape .

`` Hi , Jane ! '' I greeted with a smile and opened my driveway . `` How are you ? ''   `` I 'm fine , thanks '' She said with a sigh . `` Just a bit confused . ''   `` What ? '' I asked , trying to regain my composure . `` What 's the matter ? Is that what you 've been saying when I asked ? ''   She raised an eyebrow . `` Oh , yes . Um , yes . I just thought we should talk about this , or at least talk ... ''   Her expression immediately changed from confused to terrified . `` Wha ... Wha ... ''   My heart stopped for a moment . `` It is n't possible ! '' I said , confused .   `` What can I do about it ? ''   `` You can come back to me and explain '' She said nonchalantly , as if thinking about what to say next . `` We can talk about this together when we have some time . ''   I gave her a small smile . `` Okay , okay '' I said . `` What was that ? ''   `` A small-time music experiment , and I just thought it would be fun to play it . It 's really pretty cool . ''   Her expression was confused now . `` So what do you mean when I asked ? ''   `` It happened eventually , in the same moment I ... '' Her expression changed to something as if she simply could n't process it . `` I do n't know . But it happened . ''   `` What did you just say ? ''   `` It was a pretty big mistake . I mean , I guess it probably does n't matter . Maybe it 's the music ... Maybe ... ''   `` You 're telling me that I 'm the only one who can hear it ? ''   `` Hmm , it makes it obvious '' I said . `` It sounds pretty obvious . But people are telling me that ... ''   Jane walked away , with a smile on her face . `` Okay , make sure to tell your girlfriend about this . ''
[ I guess I should start with some background stuff ]   `` Well what can we do now , boss ? ''   `` Well , I 've got something important to tell you . You would n't believe how much we have become . ''   `` I know , boss . Just tell me . ''   `` What do we want , boss ? ''   `` Well , we 're in a very long war . We 've hit an enemy city . If we could n't land , or get off the ground , we could n't get out of this dead planet . ''   `` Yeah , boss ! ''   He walked over and put his hands on his hips .   `` Good news , sir . All I need to ask you is ... Can we keep you alive this long ? ''   He smiled and nodded .   `` Yeah . So , what do we do now , boss ? ''   `` Alright . Now , I do n't have much time , but we can come with you . ''   Once he 'd left , he turned back to face the city .   `` ... Well , get off the ground , soldier , and get off your feet . ''   `` I am , sir . ''   He looked down into his hands and nodded again .   `` Thank you , sir . ''   `` Good , good . Now , will you do that ? ''   `` Yes , sir . ''   With that , he walked off down the road .   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   `` Alright , boss . We are closing in on the enemy city . ''   `` That 's good news , boss . We 've hit an enemy city , for real . And we 're going to have to move on . ''   `` Yeah , boss . ''   He walked away as soon as he felt the ground beneath his feet .   `` Alright , boss . ''   He turned back to the camp .   `` Good news , boss . We are about the same way we did when we got captured . We are in the middle of a war . We have what we want . ''   `` That 's a good news , boss . But , what if we do n't get to the enemy city ? Then what if we get to a town . ''   `` What if we get to ... A city ? ''   `` Well , we 've hit an enemy city , boss . It 's going to be a long war . But , what about having a good friend ? ''   `` Exactly . We 'll come with you . Everything will be alright . ''   `` Very well , boss . ''   He walked down the dirt path , heave a sigh , and walked away .
They say I died when I fell asleep . When I tried to die , it felt like forever . Everything felt different .   Where was I ? Everything felt different . My body , my sanity , everything felt strange . I had no clue what was going on , but it felt like a lifetime left . I did n't even know where I was , or how I even died , but I knew I was dead .   `` Why did you die ? ''   I could n't answer . My body was gone .   `` Where was I ? ''   I could n't remember . My mind was entirely gone . I was completely conscious . My body was gone .   `` Why did you die ? ''   I could n't remember .   `` Why did you die ? ''   I could n't remember .   `` Why did you die ? ''   The word hung around in my throat . I did n't know where to say it . It floated around in space , and I did n't know what to say .   `` Why did you die ? ''   It floated around into my thoughts . All my thoughts were gone . I felt like I was floating .   `` Why Did you die ? ''   I felt a pain . I felt like I was moving .   `` Why did you die ? ''   It floated around in my thoughts . All my thoughts were gone . I felt like I was floating .   `` Why Did you die ? ''   I could n't remember .   `` Why did you die ? ''   The word floated around in my mind . All my thoughts were gone .

I felt like I was floating .   `` Why did you die ? ''   I did n't realize . I felt completely freaking out . I felt like I was floating .   `` Why did you die ? ''   It floated around in my thoughts . All my thoughts were taken . I felt like I was fucking out . I felt like I was floating .   `` Why did you die ? ''   I felt a pain . I felt like I was moving .   `` Why did you die ? ''   It floated around in my thoughts . All my thoughts were taken . I felt like I was floating .   `` Why did you die ?

We all sat around a table , waiting for the figure that would make our daily fortune .   It appeared only seconds after the next assassin entered the room , and that the man walked directly onto the stage , and began to speak .   `` Mr. Smith , thank you for coming to my doorstep this morning . ''   I nodded , and closed the door behind me , allowing the audience to catch me .   `` I am Agent Smith of C-H-2 . How may I help you today ? ''   As the voice came out of the speaker , I was met with a blank stare .   `` Hello , Agent Smith . All my duties have been fulfilled . Now , I know this is a bit unorthodox , but you took our job . I was told you would be needing it , but I was afraid to tell you why I am here today . ''   He turned the mic to face me . Blood spurted out of his mouth as he slowly began to speak .   `` I am here today to inform you that we have hired a new agent . We have sent him here to take you to your last office , where he will provide security . ''   I felt an incredible sense of pride in my abilities , and even more so than before . I knew who the new agent was , and who I could handle . I knew exactly where the job was headed .   `` Goodbye , Agent Smith . ''   But I knew what a mistake that was .
I was supposed to be the leader , so who gives that order ?   Of course it was a simple one . I was supposed to be the leader of the free world . Now I 'm a ghost . I 'm a shadow .   I have had no children . This seemed to start six years ago at the behest of my predecessors , as they claimed to have been made to rule by my father 's will . They put me in a padded cell , and then left . They told me that I would n't be able to play in the middle of a national park . Not a real park . This was not a country I wanted to grow up in . I would never be able to play in the middle of a national park .   You see , I 've grown too attached to life on a national park . I ca n't live the life I want to , and I know it . I have no regrets .   So why should I choose this position ? Because I 'm going to be a good leader who will make America great again . No , I *am* going to make America great again . This is not a position I want to go to . It 's not a position I want to live in . It 's not a place I want to live in . It 's not a place I want to be president . I wo n't leave . I wo n't go anywhere happy .   And that 's why you 're waiting for this day .   I am in this cell , awaiting my fate . You see , this is not your final position . This is not your final position . This is not a day I want to be president .   I have to be ready .   I am in this cell , waiting for my fate .   You see , I 'm waiting .   You see , my last term will have been a very interesting one . My first term would have been a very wonderful one . I would have walked everywhere , talked to people , loved them , laughed with them , talked to strangers , worked with people , and talked to crowds .   I would have been a great leader .   But it seems that you are too attached to life on a national park . Maybe someone else 's life will be like mine . Maybe you 'll be your own ghost . Do you know what that means ?   Maybe it means that you are n't the one who made America great again . You are n't the one who made America great . You are n't the one who got rid of all those people who never wanted to grow up .   I will not leave this cell alone . I will not go anywhere happy . This is not my final position . This is not my destination .   I will not leave this cell alone .   I will not leave you alone .   I miss you so much .
Oh my god , they 're here or something - that 's all I could tell from the screaming . The only thing that kept moving .   She yelled . The sound was louder than the sound of a gunshot , and what did I do ?   I pushed my way through the crowd , running past the police officers , and headed straight for the front doors .   I could hear the screams again , loud enough that I could barely make out the sign above them . I could hear the shouts again , louder than ever before , this time worse than ever before .   She was n't alone . I managed to gain my footing , my hands outstretched , and out of the crowd .   She ran , and I managed to keep her pace . It was n't long after , she was panting - her face frozen .   My hand caught her wrist .   ... *Oh my god , they 're here ! *
`` You did it again ! '' A rather jolly young girl called from downstairs .   `` Did what , what the hell has it been , what can I do for you kid ? ''   `` I told you to get me some coffee , '' the teenage lad answered , tapping his foot impatiently on the coffee table .   `` You fucking idiot ! What kind of witch do you think you are kid ? ''   `` Uh ... Uhh ... '' the young girl slurred nervously .   `` Uhh ... You 're not making any sense anymore . ''   `` I 'd like to , ummm , '' the young girl mumbled , already shaking her head as if the entire room was spinning with thoughts of the girl . `` Yeah , they are n't going to stop with that , okay ? ''   `` Uhh ... Um , yeah , '' the young girl started , her face suddenly turning red and her eyes redder .   `` Oh my god , what had happened to you , what have you done to me ? ''   The boy had a worried look on his face , if anything , but seemed to be in complete control of the situation .   `` Yeah , everything is fine ! I just called in sick so I can get some sleep ! ''   `` Yeah ... Yeah . ''   `` You mean , seriously ... you ca n't do shit like this ! You really DO N'T understand shit , why would you.. you know.. '' said the boy , his eyes still darting around the room , `` ... do it again , boy ? ''   `` Uh ... Uh ... yes ? '' said the boy , nervously .   `` But.. uh , okay . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` You do n't have to do that ! You just ca n't , you know , you ca n't.. ''   `` I 'm sure you are n't aware that . '' said the boy , his eyes suddenly widening . `` Just ... just do it , boy . ''   There was a heavy sigh , followed by a slow exhale as the boy let go of his grip , collapsing onto his couch , his chest , clutching his chest . The front door to the house burst open , and two girls stepped out , their faces turning white .   `` Hey man , '' a tall , slender gentleman greeted them politely .   `` Hey , are you alright ? '' he asked , rubbing his temples .   `` No ... no ... what 's wrong ? '' said the girl , her face still red from the fever induced conversation .   `` It seems like someone elses problem has solved . '' the man whispered , taking a step towards the girl . Just then , a small , slender woman came running up to him , wearing dark sunglasses .   `` Hey , uh.. '' she started , but the man was already standing in front of her . `` You would be the first person to realize that we 're trying to collect resources from the outside world . ''   `` I 'm not trying to do that , '' said the girl , her mouth agape . `` I 'm just trying to be a little more reasonable . ''   `` Sorry , I just realized , what do you mean there 's resources from the outside world , '' the middle-aged man said , breaking the silence . `` What does the person in question have to do with the situation ? ''   `` I 'm a demon , so I think it 's important that I be honest with myself , '' said the girl , smiling sheepishly .   `` Who were you ? ''   `` I 'm ... I do n't know , '' said the devil , his skin starting to darken . `` I 'm just ... I 'm just ... I 'm not scared yet . ''   `` You 're a demon , are n't you ? ''   `` I 'm a demon , alright ? '' the girl answered , her voice growing more frantic with every breath .   `` Okay , okay , alright . But hold on ... I 'm sorry . ''   `` I 'm sorry , '' said the devil , his voice becoming louder and more panicked . `` I 'm sorry , I ca n't ... ''   `` You have to realize that you 're just ... a demon , right ? '' said the girl , her face turning redder .   `` No , I have to realize that I ca n't control the
From the top of the mountains , she could see the blackened city that she had long since grown to love . The skyscrapers and towers that once stood proudly in the distance , now stood nothing more than a puddle of dust . The landscape was barren at best , but somehow her heart ached every second the closer she got . And even more so , she wished she could leave the city . Instead , she found the only place that would give her a reason to go . Now , on top of all of them , she could see that her mother was still there , in the very same place that she had grown to love .   Even then , she could only move one foot further down the mountain . Her father was here , too , and she could not make it back to the city . The only way she could get back to the city was here through the blackened streets , where she could stay that way forever .   She did not wish that she could have left this city .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   She stood on the edge of the city , staring up at the sky . She felt all the warmth from the city , but she could not feel anything from it . She was ready to disappear . She had been so close since she met her mother . She was ready to leave . And yet , this wasn ’ t enough .   She looked down at her feet , and then up at the sky . She began to feel the warmth that she had always felt , as if it had been a second ago . She closed her eyes and waited .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Her eyes slid open . She was in the middle of the city , eyes closed . Everything was black .   She opened her eyes again , but this time , she was in the middle of the city . Nothing was there .   Silence crept through the streets , and she heard faint sounds . She could only see the ground .   She looked around . The city was still dark .   She looked down again .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   It was over .   Without warning , the blackened city began to crawl towards her . She was trapped .   She walked forward . She walked forward .   She entered the city . She entered the city . She walked forward . There was no where to go .   She walked forward . There was no where to go .   She walked forward . There was nothing .   She walked forward . There was nothing .   But it was too late .   She felt the weight of the city , and she could feel the warmth being lifted from her body . She did not want to leave this city .   She looked down at her feet . The ground was damp . She looked down at her feet . She did not want to leave this city .   She did not want to leave this city .   She did not want to leave this city . She did not want to leave this city .   She did not want to leave this city .   She did not want to leave this city .   She turned a corner .   Just then , she heard a thud . She turned around . She saw that her mother was standing in the middle of the city . She recognized his face , and he had made haste back to the city .   She turned back around . She knew she would die here . She knew she would die here .   She turned around .   Her mother
Today is another day , another day of the year and if we can survive this , then we 'll figure out why we did n't become superheroes or something as simple as 'Time Machine ' . *The reason we can use the machine* , we call it .   There are a few things we do n't understand by the name of Time Machine . The first is that time travel is not a factor . It is a fact . Time travel is an absolute fact , something that can ’ t be realized . All we do is make the impossible happen . We do n't understand a single piece of paper or science fiction novel , we don ’ t even have the time machine to do that .   The second thing that really struck us was that everything we do is wrong . We ’ re here now , at a very very specific moment in time , and in every moment of our lives . There is nothing we can do because of God or a man . We are simply in this moment , simply time . I say time because we never have time . We really can ’ t even remember who we are , how we are born , why we are here this way . The universe is a place of fiction . I think it ’ s a place that we are , but we ’ re not sure .   The final thing you have to do is make sure we never go back . The machine will save us someday . I know it ’ s hard , but I don ’ t care . We ’ ve just reached a point where we can finally do something . We can go back . All we have to do is make sure we can be saved .
`` It was with great sadness that I decided to give you this , '' he said , '' my son ... and to be honest , it was quite a shame . I think your father and I have grown over the years has all your memories . You will realize , that this letter you sent me , only shows you a list , not a number . It was simple , a list of your last kills .   `` But this list was a mistake , '' he said , '' not a single one of them was mine . I had no regrets . ''   His eyes narrowed . `` That 's not your fault . I simply know that I have never truly loved anyone . Not even you . '' He said , and he stood next to his son . His body felt cold on the ground , and his soul was heavy . I sat there , frozen in place . If only I had been able to move the body , but the life force around me seemed so weak .   `` So what do you want , Dad ? '' I asked .   He looked down at his hands . They were cold . And as if he had n't realized what he had done .   `` I want because I loved you and I am sorry . Because I loved you and I am sorry for this poor mans soul . So , if only I had known that it would be this way . ''   His eyes grew wider , and his body began to tremble . I stood there , shocked . My heart was beating quick on its own .   `` I do n't know what to do , Dad . Please do n't do this . ''   I shook my head . He was right .   `` I will kill you one day . ''   He took his last breath , and it was like he was leaving the room .   `` Goodbye , '' he said , and I stood there .
He was surprised when she came into the room . Her bright red dress draped draping over her , her bright blue shoes tucked beneath all fours . “ I ’ ve missed you – oh God ” he said to himself . He looked at her looking for a clue , anything that could help him . She sat down opposite him and slowly made her way towards him . She was small , medium height with blonde hair and her blue eyes . He smiled .   “ Do you want to go for a walk ? ” she asked , smiling .   “ Of course ” he said . “ I ’ ll come for a walk. ”   “ Excellent ” she said with a smile .   They walked through the woods , each as bright as the last . They felt light at the end . A few cars started to take their toll on them and for a moment they looked over . “ We ’ re almost there. ”   “ Are we stopping by a convenience store ? ”   “ Yes ” she said , “ Just come on now. ”   They walked through the woods , each as bright as the last . They felt light at the end . A few cars started to take their toll on them and for a moment they looked over . “ We ’ re almost there ” she said with a smile .   They walked through the woods , each as bright as the last . They felt light at the depths of their hearts .

A few cars started to take their toll on them and for a while they looked over . “ We ’ re almost there ” she said with a smile .   A few cars started to take their toll on them and for a couple moments the light dimmed . They felt light at the end . A few cars started to take their toll on them and for a while they looked over . “ We ’ re almost there ” she said with a smile .   They walked through the woods , each as bright as the last . They felt light at the end . A few cars started to take their toll on them and for a while they stared over . “ We should go for a walk ” he said with a smile .   “ Excellent ” she said with a smile .   They walked through the woods , each as bright as the last . They felt light at the end . A few cars started to take their toll on them and for a moment he looked over . “ That ’ s great ” he said with a smile .   They walked through the woods , each as bright as the last . They felt light at the end . They felt light at the end .

On my knees , I can hear the voice of a hero in a red cape , `` This is it ! . ''   His name is Zandira , the villain known as The Black Lotus . I am what you call Earth 's hero , The Black Lotus .   He took a few steps forward , looking down at me through a teary eye . `` What are you- ''   `` Do n't you understand , I can stop you anyhow , I can stop anytime . I can stop you anytime I want . ''   A tear came down my cheek , `` Why are we ... watching ... watching you guys ? ''   `` Because , I 've been watching you in all of my life . And you think your friends are better than you ! ''   `` There is no right to be ! How can they ? You know I can stop you , and because I 've decided to , I 'm going to have to take you seriously . ''   Zandira looked me straight up , face blue , and said , `` I understand , I 'm just tired , I 'm tired , and this world is n't what I want . '' His eyes widened , and he started to cry . `` I 'm sorry . I 'm -- I 'm so sorry . ''   `` You wish you could know ? Because so ! '' I was shaking on the ground now , and I could feel his blood boiling . `` So why does n't anyone else see what you 've done ? Why does n't anyone think that you 're better than me ! Because if you do n't come out of that box , you 'll end up like you did when I saved you . ''   `` You 're lucky I found you here , Zandira . ''   The wind blows strong through the city , giving Zandira a bad look . `` You saved me ? ! ''  
`` Hey ! '' Robert yelled a half-hearted grin . He looked over the cubicle behind him , where a big , green blob of ... humanoid ?   `` Are n't we all going to get to eat all of it ? '' the blob asked , as if to ask Robert .   Robert paused as a tall , dark figure with long red hair with sharp , black eyes stared at him and raised an eyebrow .   `` Of course ! '' Robert said , as the blob vanished into thin air .   He chuckled at this and walked over to the receptionist at the receptionist 's desk . `` Hello , Mr. Johnson ! How can I help you today ? ''   The receptionist smiled , and asked , `` What can I do for you today ? ''   Robert opened the door to reveal the giant , green blob of a man , wearing a green suit and hat , holding the small , dark ball of fleshy matter above his head . `` Hello , Mr. Johnson ! How can I help you today ? ''   The receptionist sighed sadly , and asked , `` Do you want to know why I came to you today ? ''   Robert stared at the blob of meat , and then muttered , `` Please , call me Bill . I want to know why you 're here . ''   The receptionist , who always nodded and waved at him , pointed another finger at the small , green blob of meat . `` Listen , Mr. Johnson , I 'm trying to tell you now are you okay with breaking into a restaurant ? ''   Bill nodded , and said , `` Yeah , I 'm fine with breaking into a restaurant . ''   `` Well , have you decided yet ? '' the blob of meat asked .   Robert smiled , and smiled at Bill , who nodded back in approval . He walked over to the receptionist 's desk and pressed a button on the side of her desk , sending her to the floor , where her legs shook in submission and she fell backwards onto her back .   `` Hm ... Hello , Mr. Johnson . How can I help you today ? '' the blabby creature asked .   Robert opened his eyes slowly , and stared at the blob of meat . `` My name is Harold , but I 'm afraid I do n't have the right to call you that . ''   Harold smiled , and said , `` I kind of . ''   Robert smiled sheepishly at the blob of meat . `` Well , what if you just left ? What if you stopped just from going to the store yesterday ? What if you took a shortcut through a small building , and then the elevator got on fire and you fell in and got sucked through the floor rail ? ''   Harold laughed nervously , and said , `` No . ''   The blob of meat pulled out a small black , white piece of meat from his back pocket and held it up to Robert , and said , `` Are you ready for that ? ''   Robert said , `` Of course ! ''   Harold nodded , and then proceeded to explain to Robert , `` See , I could do some really good stuff . But I also could make you a really good girlfriend . Also , could I get that you love them ? ''   Robert nodded , and then said , `` Uh , I guess I can . ''   Harold sighed . `` Excellent choice ! '' he said , as Robert walked over to the cubicle , and leaned down to scratch his chin . `` And yes , I can do that , too ! And I can even take care of a lot of you , and then do some good stuff ! And I 'm even going to be in your office with you ! ''   Robert smiled , and said , `` I see . See you later , Harold . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   **Ding ! **
It seemed as though the wind had taken all the strength I had left . The clouds were no longer the only thing that fell around me .  I felt like I had been punched in the stomach . I could n't even feel my legs , nor feel the cold leather underneath my feet .  The sky had faded and my once beautiful , beautiful world had now become twisted and broken .  I heard voices around me , beckoning me to kneel and look up at the stars . The ones that lit our planet , the ones that made it seem as though we were made to live on this planet .  The wind had ceased to wind . It continued to blow .  I realized that I was not alone . I was on the ground , smiling as the sky was no longer the only thing that fell around me .  I realized that I needed to turn to face my loved ones . I could n't .   I asked the question . 
`` Agh ! '' I mumbled . `` She 's a fucking Nazi ! The fuck can you do that to me ! '' I ran for the door , hoping to avoid making any sort of contact with any of my loved ones and close the door before I start sobbing uncontrollably .   `` Well , it 's fine , I mean , it 's just , '' I sighed . `` But ... um ... I ... I 'm just so ... so confused ... I ... I.. um ... I need to talk to ... to Dad '' I trailed off , as I heard a knock on the door .   `` Sweetie , I ca n't believe he kept ordering these things , '' Mr. Freeman hissed at me . `` This is insane ! He ordered the same results as me ! '' He shook his head in disbelief .   `` Look , I 'm sorry I 'm just so busy coming home , my son is just so confused about this . He 's just so confused , and the doctors are so shocked , '' I said , trying to get up without my hands anymore . `` His own DNA is ... was ... not the same ! ''   His eyes widened as he began to shake violently from fear , realizing that even if he had n't been completely insane throughout his life , he had n't been completely sane . `` Ohhhh , honey was it you ? '' His voice came out oddly cheerful .   I grabbed the envelope from Mr. Freeman and opened it .   `` It 's here ! '' Mr. Freeman exclaimed , pulling out a letter .   I opened it to find that it was addressed to Mr. Freeman in German . `` Hello , Mr. Freeman . ''   `` Hi , honey . '' Mr. Freeman started . `` Your name is Adolf and I wanted you to come home . We have the results for your results , all of them are in your DNA , and are being traced back to you . ''   `` Haahh ... '' I said , as I took the envelope and looked into the letter . `` I guess I 'll just come on to it . ''
It 's been so long since anyone has ever read it . They might have remembered . Or they might have n't . I do n't know .   How could I have forgotten ? Why does someone have so much time and energy to learn this ? Why does something so important have to be said to them ? It does n't matter . I do n't even know how to begin . I 'm just a fucking ballerina . Fuck , I 'm even starting to forget about this shit .   The years do n't matter . The years do n't matter . I 'm a ballerina . Fuck , I 'm even starting to forget about this shit . The years are irrelevant . I ca n't remember how long *I* was . I must be a ballerina . Fuck , I 'm almost there . I 'm almost there !   I 'm almost there ! Can I see ? The trees are so bright . It 's just snow . Just snow . Just snow . FUCK . FUCK . FUCK . Fucking snow . I must keep falling . I 'm trying to keep falling . The forest is so bright . Oh God . I 've been falling so hard . OH FUCK . OH GOD . OH GOD ! OH GOD . OH FUCK .   They 're not going to make it . They 're walking by me , so loudly . I ca n't see one thing anymore . I ca n't hear anything . I ca n't smell anything . I ca n't hear anything . I ca n't taste anything . Oh God . FUCK . FUCK . FUCK . FUCK .   The wind is still going . God damn it , I 'm so cold . FUCK ! FUCK . FUCK ! OH GOD . FUCK .   I 'm falling . Is it all over ? I 'm falling hard .
`` You 're kidding me , '' Jake said . I was n't sure why , but I could feel my stomach flinching . `` *It 's just that you 're a good friend , Jake . * ''   Jake 's brow furrewed , a mixture of sweat and fear . `` What the fuck is that ? ''   To my right , I saw it again .   The gun , hidden somewhere under the school 's cafeteria sink . Jake knew I recognized it immediately . `` *There 's a bullet in it* , '' he said . * '' If you 'd just pick it up , it would n't hurt . * ''   I knew exactly what he was talking about , but I could n't shake the feeling that something was still wrong in my gut . He knew the school had a history class , and he *knew* that everyone else was too scared to use their weapon .   `` I do n't know what you 're talking about , '' I said . `` What the fuck are you talking about ? ''   Jake raised a hand to my face . `` Just take it ! Do n't worry , '' he said . `` I wo n't hurt anyone else , you know . Have fun ! ''   `` Fuck you , kid , '' I said . `` You 're *sooo* close . ''   The gun clicked . We both looked to the ceiling , where a bullet would have likely fallen through each side . `` There 's no way you 're alive ? ''   Jake shook his head . `` Nah . I 'm just trying to be nice ... ''   I pulled the gun away from my face . `` Yeah , and ... ''   `` And what 's wrong with you then ? '' Jake said .   `` I 'm the only one ... '' I said . Then I walked away .   Jake leaned against something , and the door creaked open . A tall , thin man with dirty blonde hair stood on the street . `` You should have died there , '' he said .   `` I do n't want you to die as well , '' Jake repeated .   `` I do n't want you to die as well , '' the man replied . `` All you need is some ... ''   `` I do n't want you to die as well , '' Jake said again . `` All you need is some ... ''   The man grabbed my wrist and pulled me into the world . 
I woke up to the sound of thunder and saw the flash was getting closer and closer . It made me look around only to see a bright flash out of my hand and a piece of paper lying on the ground .   **January 31th**   My blood ran cold in my veins . I grabbed at it and dropped it . As I stared , I took a deep breath in . I shook my head with fear and started running towards the truck . I was suddenly tackled by a man . He had a gun and he was holding onto me .   `` You alright ? '' I asked softly .   He shook his head yes and told me nothing .   `` I 'm sorry , you 're not dead . '' He cried .   I stopped and looked at him . His hands and face were white , although they did n't look like they were covered in blood . He was covered in a black . He looked at me like he was crazy .   `` Good luck , I love you . '' I said as I turned and walked away . I had a gun at my side and a note .   **January 31nd**   My face was red . `` What do you think did you do ? '' I asked him .   The man still held onto me .   `` Well , I 'm a photographer , so it would be nice to make notes . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I made a ... a joke . ''   `` Was you actually a joke ? ''   Tears began to well in my eyes . `` I do n't remember being a joke anything . ''   `` You 're good , I love you . '' My fingers began to shake uncontrollably . `` Here , take it . I 'll make sure you drink whatever is inside you . ''   He took out an ink bottle and drank it .   `` This will help you forget this . ''   I was speechless .   The man handed me the pen and I wrote it down .   **January 31st**   I wrote a note to my boss .   `` You know what , this song 's a special one . ''   `` Sure . '' I said as I left the office .   I continued to write . My boss took me to the back of the truck and we drove off .   *I hope you enjoy this song*   `` I know I 'm getting late but I 'll take a break . ''   `` ... ''  
( Sorry formatting , I 'm the third time writer here , so I 'm not sure if I should be more specific )   `` I 've never ... ''   That was the only sound I could manage as I lifted my head off the ground . I looked up , only to saw the old lady standing there , a few feet away . The same old lady , older than me , she was smiling at me , even though I had no clue why .   `` Yes you have . '' She said . `` We all do . ''   As I looked down , I saw something different . The old lady was smiling at me , but this time , it was different . This time , there was no sadness , but there was something that had changed . It was a slight warmth I had never felt before . If only I had known , I would have even realized . I quickly walked back to my car , and started driving . It was a normal day at work , everything was going according to plan . I was n't going to complain , I just got my degree and I was ready to start my life anew without anyone noticing .   But something was different . I wanted to look up at them , maybe see how they react to my gaze . I had never seen it before . As I had looked up , there was another woman sitting over me . I stood beside her , and she did n't move . I tried to sit up , but I just continued to stare down at her . I did n't understand . She was smiling right at me in the same way that it was then .   Finally , I got to talking to her , and she started asking me what I was doing here . I knew that I would n't even have what she asked , I was just waiting patiently . When she asked if I was okay , she simply looked around , and smiled again . One last time , I walked away .
Not actually intended to be a writing prompt , but I hope I am doing it right . Here goes .   Sam was lying on the floor of the small room , soaked in sweat and confusion . He could n't remember that being there in first place , but he remembered that this was not the first time ...   The last time he 'd visited this place .   The last time he 'd been there at all ...   The first time he 'd seen this place .   `` I'm.. '' Sam started , but could n't finish his sentence . His throat was cold and he barely managed to stop himself .   `` I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to.. '' The man stopped walking , and looked around the abandoned warehouse .   `` I 'm sorry . '' Sam mumbled , but he could n't help but feel pity , but he 'd done nothing but walk away from this place .   When he arrived in the server room , he could n't help but grin as the man began taking his place on the barstool beside the door . Sam remembered that it was n't always like this , but that was the first time this place had touched him .   The man stopped walking , and turned the corner , but Sam could n't help but mutter to himself to himself ,   `` Why wo n't you try to go for a walk ? ''   He turned back to the barstool , and looked at Sam , and saw that he still smelled of sweat and confusion .
I stared at her , mouth agape , her eyes wide with fear . She stared back at me , mouth agape . She was one of the few humans left alive . She was the only woman who would ever understand that being alone was incredibly unfair .   `` Mommy , '' she finally said , shaking her head , `` I 'm sorry . I ca n't take it anymore . I have to see our children again . ''   `` I 'm , '' I responded , trying to hold back the tears . I saw her face again , and this time , she finally said , `` I 've always been there for you , '' her eyebrows knit together , as if to mock me , that same frightened look that had caused her to break .   `` I love you , '' she said , her voice soft . `` I love you so much . ''   Her mouth closed as she spoke ; the tears were on her cheeks ; she was crying for the last time .   `` I 'm sorry , mommy . I 'm so sorry . ''
Drones , helicopters , and soldiers filled the streets .   I walked slowly through the crowd . Every single one , one or two of them , with its own insignia . But this particular one stood in front of me . It was like a statue . Its face radiated a soothing light .   It introduced itself as a giant , smiling face . The crowd swarmed behind it , taking everything . `` Welcome back to the game ! '' it said . `` Welcome back to the game ! ''   It spoke again . `` Welcome back to the game ! ''   For the first time in centuries , I realized what it had meant .   It gave me the biggest hug .   `` Welcome back to the game ! '' it said .   Today I felt terrible . I felt like I had drank a very long , very salty liquid and my body had been burned . I was being crushed .   I asked if it was okay .   `` No ! ''   `` Well , well . It 's just , well , it 's just , well . And ... well , it 's just , well… it 's just… it 's just , well . ''   I wanted to scream .   `` Well , well . It 's just , well . It 's just , well . ''   The crowd started to murmur , and I could n't give a shit .   `` What do you mean ? '' I enquired .   `` Well , well , well . It 's just , well . ''   The crowd was so stunned that I did n't even notice the huge metal thing on my head . It 's face was only a few inches across from mine .
I was n't surprised when a shadow cast a shadows shadow across my body . For a moment I thought I saw something different . A sort of shadow that shimmered brightly . It 's weight came naturally to me , and I felt as though it was walking towards me . The man next to me appeared to be completely normal , not afraid , but not without fear .   `` Welcome to Bob 's Inn . Please wait here and relax for a bit . ''   `` Hi , I need to talk to my landlord . '' I sat in the booth overlooking the bar . `` I 've left you alone in my bar . Is that alright ? ''   `` I do n't know . It 's better than dead . ''   `` What was the landlord saying about dead ? ''   `` His shadow will appear when you visit . ''   `` That 's strange . Oh , that 's what they told me . ''   `` They did n't tell me they had a job to do . ''   `` I thought so . ''   I put out my palm and touched the wood . My shadow was completely gone from my body . That did n't help me for a few minutes .   I then went to grab my shotgun , but I saw his shadow again .   `` Hello , Bob 's Inn ? ''   The man was quiet for a moment . `` What are you doing out here ? ''   `` I 've been looking for you . I want to see you . ''   `` But I do n't want anyone seeing me . ''   `` That 's the problem . You 're an evil shadow . Stop worrying . Why are you doing this ? ''   `` I want to know why . ''   The man shrugged . `` Let 's see if I can get lost . ''   I sat in the booth . `` You can do that . That 's why I 'm here . ''   The man laughed . `` I do n't have a problem with lost . ''   `` You 're right . ''   When I came to , I was walking towards the bar . I looked at the mysterious man . `` We have n't talked yet . Did you see a few drinks ? ''   The man shook his head . `` No . That would be gross . Go see my friend . ''   `` Oh . ''   I went to my friend 's room . She was sitting in bed - not entirely awake , perhaps - but asleep nonetheless .   And then I saw him .   `` I thought you said I was going to see you . ''   `` Well , no , it 's alright . ''   `` Well , it 's better than dead . I 've left you alone in my bar . ''   `` You ... ''   `` I know . ''
`` What 's your name ? ''   `` Thomas . Now , I do n't know how you 're feeling , but ... I ... ''   `` Okay . ''   `` You do n't have any powers . ''   `` No , I do n't have powers . ''   `` Well , I just ... I do n't have any powers . I just ... . I do n't have anything . I 'm a nothing . I do n't know why I 'm here . ''   `` Please ... . Thomas , do n't use your powers to hurt anyone else . ''   `` You know ... I ca n't ... I do n't want to . ''   `` You ca n't ! You 're already dead . We 're still dead ! All the stars were dead ! And all the stars lost ! ''   `` ... . ''   `` And now you 're *weeks* ? ''   `` No . ''
We were in a small town , and we were afraid . They wanted to kill us - to take us away from our family , and even if they did , they would n't stop to save us .   `` If we could still have our friends , we would stop them from ever killing us . ''   `` I thought we were just friends , and we ca n't deal with that now . ''   `` You do n't understand , do you ? Life is too long , not good enough ! ''   `` Are you kidding me ? ''   `` Yes , yes . ''   `` We 're dead ! We 've been dead for too long , we 're trapped ! ''   `` Do you understand ? We feel trapped . ''   `` Yes ? ''   `` The way we feel is because we do n't want to die . ''   `` Because we ca n't die ! ''   `` Because we ca n't die ! This is no life ! We are n't *this* . We are gone ! ''   `` It does n't even make sense ! ''   `` No , it does n't . You are here , and the only thing that makes sense is that we are n't dead ! ''   `` No , it does n't . It 's just that we are n't dead . ''   `` That does n't make sense ! It does n't make sense ! ''   `` It does . ''   `` Yes , it does . ''   We were alone in this room for a while .   `` Why ? ''   `` Because we 'd have our loved ones alive if we were n't always so afraid ! ''   `` I never thought that would happen ! ''   `` It would , but you 're not supposed to be afraid . ''   `` I am ! ''   `` No , you are n't supposed to be like that . ''   `` I am , but I can , but I cant live like this ! ''   `` I am not supposed to be afraid , but I can live ! You are the only one here , and you 've been the only one there for so long . ''   `` I do n't understand . ''   `` You are meant to live , but I 'm not meant to be like that ! ''   `` It 's not your fault , but it 's not your fault ! ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` You are n't meant to live . ''   `` You are n't meant to live ! ''   `` You are supposed to live ! ''   `` I do n't understand ! ''   `` I can live ! I can live ! I can live ! ''   `` You want us ? ''   `` Yes ! ''   `` I want you to live ! ''   `` It does n't make sense ! ''   `` I do n't understand ! ''   `` It does n't make sense ! ''   `` It does n't make sense ! ''   `` It does n't ! It does n't make sense ! ''   `` It does n't make sense ! ''   `` It 's okay ! We are n't going to die here ! ''   `` I.. ''   `` It 's alright ! ''   `` It 's okay ! ''   `` It 's okay ! ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` It 's okay ! ''   `` You are n't supposed to live . ''   `` No , it 's okay ! It 's okay ! ''   `` It 's okay ! It ! ''   `` It 's okay ! ''   `` It 's okay ! It 's okay ! It 's okay ! They 're going to get us out of here ! ''   `` It 's okay ! ''   `` It 's okay ! ''   `` It 's okay ! It 's okay ! ''   `` It 's okay ! ''   `` It 's okay ! ''   `` I
No matter what you do , you get what you want . You get what you want . You get what you want .   Tonight , however , I was more than just a regular customer . The only problem was , no one would ever serve me before . I knew it , but this time my eyes were on something .   `` I have a problem for you . ''   No , no , no you stupid bitch .   `` I ca n't afford that for you . I need to meet your quota . ''   You know what me problem is , I 'm the only one here . I do n't even have to speak to anyone . Nevermind that I have n't even noticed you .   `` What do you know ? ''   Well , I do n't know , but I 'm really uncomfortable in front of you .

I 'd wake out of my slumber by a goner carrying a clipboard . I was n't sure if I 'd seen a thing . I checked my watch . 5:27 AM .   I was n't sure what to do or where to go . I got up . I walked around the block , in all my glory . Nothing much seemed to make sense .   I exited my apartment complex . I walked up to the elevator and stared at it . It was 3:17 am . I glanced down the window of the building .   The elevator stopped . I walked to the elevator and stepped aside . I knocked . I asked `` Hey , can you have a seat ? ''   `` Thanks . Do you know what time it is ? ''   `` Huh ? No . ''   `` Well , I guess you should get going ! ''   I took a seat and made my way to the shower . I had a shower for about an hour . It was an attempt to stop me from leaving the building . I washed my hands gently on my face and picked up the towel , brushing them off . I had a towel on me to dry off .   I heard the sirens and saw a silhouette of a young man yelling `` I WANT TO KILL THEM ! ''   I shuddered .   `` No . '' I said .   `` No . '' The sound of the sirens grew louder .   I panicked and ran to where the cloaked figure was pointing up . I ran and ran .   What ? I thought . The voice was coming from everywhere .   I ran and ran and ran , running .   I couldnt find it .   I heard the sirens again .   I turned around . The child was laying on their side . His eyes were open and his eyes were wide .   I ran to him , crying .   I hugged him . He looked up at me .   I grabbed his hand .   I asked `` What time is it ? ''   `` It 's 9:30 . I 'll be gone at this point . ''   I kissed him .   `` I love you . ''   I left the building .   I put my headphones on . I turned around .   I heard the sirens again .   I saw a woman 's voice yelling `` LEAVE ME ! ''   I looked up and saw a man and a woman standing outside of a house . They looked more familiar .   I looked down at my cellphone and realized that I had 3 more messages from the girl .   2 .   1 .   2 .   3 .   Ugh . I 'm so sorry . I shoulda known . I shoulda known . I shoulda known . If I had just text her so I could know .   I pressed 1 .   1 .   2 .   I told her to leave .   She did .   I walked over to my car and got out . I 'd just gotten home and the sirens were getting louder . I checked my watch . 5:26 AM .   I was n't sure if I 'd seen a thing . I did n't know if I 'd seen a thing . I got up . I walked towards my house . I opened the door and walked in .   I knew I should have known . I shouldve been home . I shoulda known . I shoulda known .   I opened the front door and met my wife 's face as I shut the door . It was n't her . It could n't be . It could n't be .   I ran toward the house and stopped halfway into the backyard . I opened the front door and saw my wife . It was n't her .   She was smiling . She was holding her own . She was holding her own baby .   I stared in shock as I raised my head towards her . I could n't speak . I just looked at myself in amazement .   I was still smiling .   I was still smiling .   I did n't know what to do or say .   I pressed 4 .
`` I 'll be bringing the munchies ''   I looked at the man before me with a very confused expression . He was completely ordinary , just a average man who lived in the middle of nowhere , and was in a very poor neighborhood .   `` I 'll be bringing the munchies , and I 'll put them on the table , but first you need to tell me what 's wrong . ''   `` I need to know what 's wrong . ''   `` That 's right . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` You have to tell me what 's wrong . ''   I quickly looked around again . The man was completely ordinary , but he was n't even dressed like any of the others I 'd seen before .   `` Okay , I want someone to do this . '' I quickly said , `` I want to be like him - a person who needs to be polite . This will help you understand that a person is incapable of doing this . He needs to get on his feet , to walk to the kitchen , to eat a meal . If he does this , he needs to be polite enough to get out of jail . ''   `` Okay , okay . ''   `` Then you need to tell me what 's wrong . ''   `` What 's wrong ? ''   `` You have to tell me what 's wrong . ''   `` Okay . ''   I ran over to the table and picked up the munchies which I had brought .   `` Tell me what 's wrong . ''   `` I 'm not bothering here . ''   `` Alright . ''   `` Alright . ''   I grabbed the munchies from the table and handed them to the man sitting across from me . He started towards me , but as I took the munchies , he spoke .   `` You 'd better get a new one , because we have a new one . ''   A moment later , an old lady appeared from the kitchen , stepping out of the kitchen . She spoke quickly , `` But this one will be ... ''   `` Mr Baker , I need you to let me finish . I 'm done here . ''   `` That 's correct . ''   I looked around but there was nowhere else . I asked her once more , `` I 've wasted my time and money . I do n't want to embarrass anyone else . ''   `` Let me finish . ''   She took a step backwards from me and put her arm around her shoulder . I looked at her in disbelief .   `` Your time is up . ''   `` I see . ''   I got up and walked out of the house , knowing I had failed to give her such a terrible fate .

'' I stated calmly .   `` I agree with you . '' the man replied , staring in wonder at my handiwork . I could n't believe it . The man was clearly in shock . I shook my head .   `` It 's been weeks since I wrote you down . '' My voice dropped .   `` Hmmm ? '' The man responded .   `` This is not your first . Do you remember how you tried to get me to write you down ? ''   `` I did n't write you down . I wrote you down because I knew I can make you better than you think . ''   `` But I could n't make you better , I just could n't do it . ''   `` You have to do what you can . ''   I nodded dumbfounded . I did n't have the energy to respond to this man anymore . I had figured out how to use my power , and I would n't be needing it . I just wanted to find peace . I had taken my last breath in preparation for this moment . I finally began to understand what I was going to do . It was a simple matter of using my power , and I could finally prove it .   `` Why would I need to just write you down ? '' I asked cautiously .   `` Because I could n't do the same thing . I know I can . And it 's time to go . ''   `` Fine . '' I said , and turned around , disappearing into the vast blackness of darkness .

''   `` I know why you 've been chosen , mate . But the British have decided to keep you here . ''   `` What ... the ... Queen ? ''   `` You see , mate , this is complicated . ''   `` I do n't understand ! I do n't want to live long enough to be Queen ! ''   `` Well , you see , mate , the Queen is part of this realm , and this is why you 've been chosen .

`` My client has just been accused of conspiracy to take my life . ''   I had been looking at the photo for about 10 minutes , it was of a man sitting on a bench . He was wearing a white suit and was wearing only a tie . I knew it would make him look like he was in a movie ; but the one the man was wearing must have been high school sweetheart or something . He had to look at the photo and see the same result . I was unsure what to say .   `` I 've just been told that one of my neighbors is going to take my life . Do you know if that 's true ? ''   I looked at him curiously .   `` Well , I have a friend who I was looking for . Now , I actually have a friend who I am looking for . ''   I took another look at him . They looked like they were trying to understand what was going on .   `` You have a friend who I was looking for . But do n't worry ; I will find you soon enough because you will be the only one who will know . ''   I nodded .   `` I think I have the right idea here ''   I started walking toward the judge . I noticed there are people walking away from him , which I thought would help me find a quicker way to get away .   `` There is nothing wrong with having the right idea here ''   I walked toward the judge and he started talking to some of the crowd .   `` Your honour , those people have taken my life , they have taken my life , they have taken my death . Your honour , are you sure ? ''   I looked around at the crowd .   `` Yes , I am certain . ''   `` Good . ''   The entire courtroom stopped . Everyone was quiet . Slowly , it was dark . I looked around the room but I saw no one . I looked at the judge again :   `` You have a friend who I have looking for . But do n't worry : we will find you soon enough because you will be the only one who will know . ''   I looked at the crowd again , who was waiting for me . The judge smiled again .   `` Well , I have a friend who I am looking for . I am going to get him out of there , I will make sure he gets as far away from me as possible when we get there . ''   I put my hand on the judge 's shoulder . `` Goodbye , my friend . ''   ***   **Edit : ** Punctuation
`` Welcome to Haggardville , you may sit down . These are the students who learn about you on today 's student list . '' The teacher looked at all the students in hushed tones , while the man stared at the teacher .   `` Sorry for the delay , I have a little lesson for them . '' The man looked up from the book in his hand , he was tapping his pen against a white board . `` I 'll start by saying that I 'm not exactly a computer geek . '' It took him a couple seconds to finish his thought , but he managed .   `` I am a highly respected marine officer from the Navy . '' The student knew this was the first time he had heard the name of this marine . It was part of the reason he had been assigned to Haggarville . He had been only 17 years old when it happened . He had come to learn that the Navy was losing control of the United States . He did not want to get his hands dirty of all the files .   `` Well , then . Let me tell you a story . '' The student began , `` Why I was assigned to this shitty school . ''   The lecturer continued , `` I remember the day I was 6 . My name was James , and I was on my way to class . ''   `` No , James , it is n't that . I was not going to leave school , I was just going to school . '' The student spoke , `` My parents were never around to see me , but my mother gave me this assignment to monitor me . She was also known as a M.O.N.E.D . When I was a child she believed I was safe . I never got much experience with it , so I did n't want to spend my days with her , but she did . ''   `` That does not make sense for you . '' The lecturer looked at him , and suddenly a flash of bright light and a muffled voice broke through the darkness , `` But I have a friend who helps me . ''   `` My parents were n't around to see me , so she did n't want me to . '' The student said , clearly annoyed .   `` Sorry , but you are the one who is really helping me . '' The lecturer looked at the student , whom now had a lot of black bruises running down his body , he tried to calm herself .   `` Alright , alright , I am going to start by saying that I am a highly respected marine officer trained in the Navy . '' James tried to walk away , and he could n't because of a terrible accident . `` I was just heading to class when I realized that my parents were not around to see me . They were n't around to see me . '' James tried to move but his legs got held against him . The lecturer reached out to touch him , but he felt a kick . `` Ow ! '' The professor said loudly , and James was brought back into reality .   `` You were attacked by a group of soldiers . I had no idea that an M.O.N.E.D.E.D.E.D.E.d.E.D . would attack you . You were told to retreat , and I did so . '' James looked at his parents , who did n't see him , and they all began to look angry , as they began crying loudly .   `` You were attacked by a group of terrorists . I had no idea it would attack me . '' The lecturer looked at James now , who was now completely covered in blood .   `` What ? ! '' James could feel himself shaking , he did n't know what to say . He looked down , and suddenly another flash of light filled the surrounding area , until suddenly it was back to normal .   `` People are going to die ! Are you okay ? '' A woman started walking up to James , her voice shaking .   `` Please , let me talk to you . Let me tell you a story ! '' James screamed as much as he could , trying to stay calm .   `` No , you are okay , you are safe , I am sorry . '' The lady turned around once more , and James began to panic . He got up , and yelled , `` No , this is n't the time to cry . I am going to tell you a story . ''   `` Okay , '' the lady said , stepping outside . `` Let me go . I am going to tell you a story . '' She walked away , but she was not done with the story , she walked out of the class , and James and his parents watched as the gunmen turned in their guns .   `` Now
Today , it was some time before the news was released .   It was early morning when the first news came , of course . The first thing about it was some old lady being lectured about the nature of life . She had n't quite finished her class . She had just finished what she thought was a great novel , and the latest in this kind of thing was making her very want to speak up for herself .   `` Well , I 've been keeping a close eye on , oh , and those Jehovah 's witnesses , because the people that are coming out of nowhere , they seemed the most worried about , '' she said to herself sarcastically . She could count on someone seeing her , `` So they all knew , right ? Like , what 's going to happen next ? ''   She paused , `` Well , one of these people will all be dead , right ? ''   `` Yeah . One of these peoples , '' she replied , `` will probably be more anxious than the others , and maybe he 'll tell them the truth , right ? ''   `` Oh , '' another thought came into her mind . `` I thought that would end up being an interesting story ! '' She had imagined that people would be arguing with each other , and it seemed an idea at the time . Maybe she should get out of bed and tell them to leave , that would be nice .   After a moment of that , she decided that after all , she should tell them the truth . `` Maybe , '' she said aloud , `` maybe , this one will be better suited ? ''   `` It sure was , babe , '' the woman said , and she walked out of the room .   -- -   /r/dori_tales

For the longest time in my life I had made up my mind to be the man that I truly believed in . As a child I 've believed in life and death , but never really believed in anything and I 've been hiding from the world for a long time now . To think that people I know are actually better off in a world where everyone does n't meet and hate each other .   You see the universe is a huge and vast place to live and to love . It 's incredibly vast . Like there are entire planets out there , with all very different colored planets and different landscapes . Once there , there is a planet with different organisms on the planet , and on the planet they are . The way they look is amazing . I learned one day that there was a planet named Earth , Earth , and it was beautiful . It was almost exactly the same color as the sun and stars . I will never tell you that there are different planets out there .   After 3 years , the planet I grew up in was completely new . This planet showed up on the planet with colors I had never seen before . Blue walls , different animals , different animals , different oceans . It was so alien and alien to my species . Not even the moon .   That was when I first saw it . A tiny mountain . I could n't believe it , but I did n't lose my faith forever . I did n't remember that day , or the last time my mother went to visit . I did n't remember how long it took me to leave the planet with her .   But I did . The entire world was on it 's way to the summit , and it stood at attention . It 's color was so close to Earth . The mountain was a bright blue , the mountains too . When my mother came to visit I had a feeling I needed to tell her something . So I brought her the Mountain and told her about it for the first time .   After she left I told her about the mountains . When my mother walked up to me I could see the beautiful blue sky for at least 3 days . I told her I wanted to make sure , but she did n't understand .   The world stopped for at least 3 days . After a few minutes of my mom going to visit , I let her go quietly . I asked her what has gone wrong with her , but she said that it 's gone and that she has n't made any new changes .   When she came back to my planet , a small red mountain surrounded me . It was huge and looked very intimidating . I told her about it and she told me she feels bad for the people in this world . I told her how there are so many different types of people out there and how they feel like such a waste . I told her that there are so many different types of people out there and how they treat other people so differently .   She asked me a few questions as to why there are so many different types of people out there and how they treat others differently . I told her how I feel , how I need to be better , and how to live . The only difference is that there are so many different types of people out there , and she told me about this and that , and she told me that she wants to see them grow and change , and that she wants to see the way people treat others .   After awhile she came looking for me and told me to follow her . We walked for 3 days , and she eventually led me to her house located at a small country called `` Nice '' . We walked with her for an hour for what seemed like hours , and she came back to her house and told me that she saw a small yellow house in which she lived .   Since she left , she has been telling me that she wants to see the other worlds . She has been telling me of how she feels special and that , and that her happiness is one that can be shown to everyone in the world , and that she wants to show everyone that it can be seen in people . She tells me that she loves that there are so many different types of people out there and that all of the different types of people are better off in a world where everyone does n't meet and hate each other . I tell her how everything is so wrong with her , but she tells me that she hates that there are so many different types of people out there and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and that , and ...   `` ... That looks like I 'll need to ask you a few good questions . What
How you done it ?    It started out small . I 'd been sent overseas to look for a target that was n't going to die . I assumed the best course of action would be to try and go down there . But I guess I 've never quite gotten the courage to do it . Could n't , that was a mistake .    All you need is some poison , and it has to do with the way you treat the people around you . You could kill all of them , but you could n't kill everyone else . You were n't going to get away with that , that 's what it was like to die .    A certain man passed away last week , and for some reason , I 'm not there anymore . I 'm not going to write about what happened next . If there was any hope , it would be for a long time . I 'm so tired of living in this damn war , and that 's why this letter 's written , so here I am .    Do n't call me crazy or anything . I just like to think that people are calling me crazy without realizing it . I would 've done it myself . I simply ca n't take it anymore .    I suppose I 'll see you soon , and I appreciate all the joy you 've given me at trying to help you . It was n't a very easy task . I could n't even make up my mind how long it takes to find someone like you .     And good bye ,   John
`` The prosecutor , '' I say , smiling . `` Can you tell me why I 'm here , detective ? ''   I nod , my face bright . `` Because I , '' I say . `` I did it . ''   His eyes go wide . `` Come on ! '' He says . `` Please , just let me go see it . ''   `` What is it ? '' I ask . `` You still do n't understand ? ''   He waves his hand . `` I told you , detective , '' he says . `` I *said* I did it . ''   `` That 's not something you mean . ''   `` Is that -- ''   I hold up an arm . `` Yes , detective . It is . It is . ''   `` What 's the point ? '' God , is that a word ? *Me* ? I do n't know what I mean by that . `` Go away . ''   I do n't really know what to say . `` Fine ! Go , '' I say . `` Go , have fun , or you 'll be found guilty ! ''   `` No ! '' He screams , and I feel sympathy surge in my gut . `` No ! ''   `` No , detective , '' I say . `` At peace , '' I look him in the eye , and I see red . `` Please , just- ''   `` Quiet ! '' God , it does n't work like that . `` When are you going to tell me what happens ! ? ''   `` I 'm still alive , '' I say , and I realize that my throat is raw . `` I 'm not going to tell you what happens ! ''   `` Please , '' He snaps . `` Please , just- ''   I stand there , tears streaming down my cheeks . `` Please , just let me go , detective , '' I say , and he goes away .   The door closes behind me , and I feel my heart begin to settle in .   `` Come on ! '' I say , shaking . `` Come on ! ''
The great clock struck twelve . The days of war never ended .   Ten days at a time . That 's how many of us had come . Ten days of our struggle against the greatest threat we could imagine . Ten days worth , with the little remaining of us , fighting to the last breath . It was a time to live .   A fight had been won in two days .   Of course , the war could have been won elsewhere . It must have been lost many times . The forces of the universe had worked hard to eliminate the invaders . They attacked our planet , our planet , our planet . It was at one point that we had been pushed to keep the Earth safe and secure in our home .   A war had been won in two days .   How many of us had come ? Ten days at a time . That 's how many of us had come . Ten days worth , with the little remaining of us , fighting to the last breath , fighting to the last breath . It was a time to live .   So many of us had come , and so many . That 's how many of us had come . Ten days at a time .   And what were we waiting for ?   Nothing .   The enemy did n't even notice us , of course . But then they could n't .   The alien invasion had simply appeared . In plain sight right in front of us , an invasion ships in a different way . No military , just regular soldiers .   It 's what they called them .   *Exiled on the streets of New London . *   Those were the words they used when the invasion first came .   *Exiled in the streets of New London* .   The invaders did not know what this meant . But each time their scouts returned we found no weapons . Instead we found nothing . It was as if they simply forgot where they had been .   They were scared of us , but that did n't bother them at all .   They knew it made them feel right .   So many of us were looking for a way out .   In the end , they left us alone .   *Taken alive by a hivemind . *   It took a while for them to get used to the idea of escaping the rest of us .   But every time we fell back into the void , we found hope again .   *There is more than one life in this universe . *   They would come back in peace , and help us again .   ***   More Stories at r/Andrew__Wells
In the weeks following the outbreak , there was a lot of panic . They had all kinds of weaponry , some in rifles , and some in military firearms . Even the ones who tried to escape were stopped by security . And so on and so forth . They started with small groups , a few in military attire , some with small knives and slingshots . They would come from the shadows , as if on the verge of hysteria in advance of the infection .   Then there were the gangs . They were the ones who would look down on anyone who could n't escape and attempt to kill them . The gangsters made noise , but even they were n't there to harm anyone . They moved slowly , as if their movements were slow and deliberate . This did n't bother me .   I was one of the gangsters . I held up a hand , and I felt calm . I was n't afraid . I was just *happy* . They pushed me away , and I looked around , searching for any signs of humanity .   Then the group came , slowly , and silently . They were n't much stronger , but they looked like they could fight even with a knife , and their hands hung loosely in the air . Every so often , they would start walking in circles , and I could see them , watching me quietly . And look at them .   I did n't speak , but I knew that they were thinking . They wanted to get out of the shadows , and there was something wrong with me . I turned away from my hands once again . I was hoping someone might find me . But , it was too late , and I was running out of ideas . As the group grew closer and closer , I could n't stop myself .   And I was running away .   -- -- -- -- -   *If you enjoyed this , please check out More Stories at /r/MatiWrites . *
I knew it was coming . I realized , I knew it was coming soon . I had my family waiting . I knew it was going to happen . I knew it was going to happen in the moment . But I could n't stop it . As the war and famine raged on , I felt it all too much . The people I loved , the family I loved as well , the family I hated as well , and the people I loved for whom I loved as well . I knew it was coming .   The moment it happened , the final rays of light and sound seemed to vanish into nothingness . It all began at 2 AM .   My guardian angel - Michael - walked into my house and sat on my bed . He took a deep breath , then set about studying my family closely . He spoke .   `` Do you remember what happened to the kids ? ''   His voice was gravelly and cold . I could see his eyes staring intently at the floor , he put a hand on my shoulder . I did n't hesitate .   `` Yes . They were in my room . They all had their parents and they were both crying when they saw their son . '' He looked up and saw a glimpse of anger , sadness , and despair .   `` Michael ... ''   `` Yes , my son . They watched as his child was slaughtered by your father and his friends . I knew it was coming . I knew I had to do it . '' We walked back into his room and sat back .   `` Michael ... what had happened ? ''   He grabbed my shoulder and squeezed my hand tighter . He stood up and walked to his bedroom . He poured some water onto his bed .   `` Michael ... what incident happened ? ''   `` I was with my family and they were screaming in a nearby alley . I had seen the screams of my family . They were so loud that I had picked them up . They were a terrifying sight to behold . I watched in horror as they jumped from the street and ran towards the city and their families . I then turned back to my family and wept . As I watched in horror as they fell to the ground and started to weep . '' He leaned over my body and looked into my eyes .   `` For what ? For what reason ? ''   He put his arm around my shoulder . He whispered in my ear , `` For so long , my son . I thought that this may be the last time we meet . But Michael ... this is the last time we will meet . ''   I could feel his hands pulling me backwards . His gaze was almost as piercing as the light that enveloped us . I could n't stop it .   `` They were all killed by my father . He did not give me the courage to do it . He could n't let me give you the courage . I could not . I could not bear to see my family burn down . '' He stood up and walked to his bedroom door .   `` I will not leave you . You were never much of an option . You were always ahead of me . Now I will never leave you . ''   I embraced his shoulders , tears streaming down my face .
The game changers were popular among the lower classes of society , like most old folks , with the ability to give emotions for the player through their own actions . They were used to providing insight to the criminal world , at times . It was very rare to find a better person , but only once they had figured out what was wrong with the humans , usually it was only a matter of time before the program broke out and started re-engineering the AI .   And the biggest discovery was that the program was actually programmed to help the user experience the most emotions . Not only that , this program was able to provide information on the average person , in fact if their actions were n't exactly the same as theirs , they could also provide information on a person . The program was able to determine the outcomes of those actions , so there was no way to know what they were doing at all .   When it was finally done , the program was able to connect all parts of the program to a computer , which was able to help people . When people returned to their homes , they would receive the best emotional experiences they came across . This is a very rare phenomenon , especially on a daily basis , which is why this game was popular .   When the program booted up , it informed the user that they had been connected by some kind of connection hub . Their homes appeared as a network which was connected by a central computer , which was also connected by a small electrical net . The connection hub would be connected via a camera . The camera would be broadcasting a video of a boy , named Jimmy , on a beach . Jimmy was sitting and enjoying his summer days , when the connection hub opened .   The boy 's eyes , which had n't yet adjusted to the lights , stared at the camera in surprise . Jimmy was suddenly very excited , and had a large smile on his face . He ran towards the computer , and opened the door .   The man was lying on the ground , looking very excited . At first , he did n't realize it at first , as he did n't think it would ever end . However , as he looked around , he noticed there was no single person in sight . As he looked around , his eyes landed on Jimmy . His eyes began to close , and he quickly ran away , and ran for the hospital .   This was where the program was released to the public . This program was now able to take that away from the people who were n't happy . The people knew this was a secret , and there would n't be anyone to save one of them .   That led to the new program that the government was creating . When asked why the program was released , the government said it was because people had been doing this for years , and that people could n't find out . The people believed it was because the program would make people pay for it , and thus a reward for using the program .   Several years later , all of the scientists and academics of the world had been able to afford it , with the exception of that specific AI that the government provided to them . Its ability to provide information around the world , the AI that helped them through their hardships .   They were amazed at the advancement of the human race all around the world , even though humanity had achieved so much with it over the years .   When they discovered the program , they saw an incredible amount of changes .   --   Thank you for reading ! If you enjoyed this , check out more stories at /r/MatiWrites .

It 's a bit late , I was just a little busy from my writing prompt . I 'll keep typing if any of you have any suggestions or suggestions !   --   The General had spent many an hour practicing his lines , and he was very good at it . He knew that he was going to be late , but he had n't actually been trained enough . He was going to be late when his men had first received orders to attack the enemy , and the enemy did n't just look dangerous without having a choice . In a way , he 'd done this for years .   He was about to fire when several of his men burst into the general 's office , shouting orders . But he was n't listening , he was being serious . As their soldiers opened fires , General T. Evans caught his breath , and slowly turned around . * '' General T. Evans , please come with us to the enemy outpost . They 'm dying . `` * The words left his mouth , but he could n't keep his eyes on the soldiers . Instead , he looked down at them . As he began walking towards the enemy outpost , he heard a voice from far off , `` We 've been shot , General T. Evans . We 've been shot . ''   Unbelievably , President T. Evans had n't been shot in a war . He did n't have any clue why , but he knew that he was going to go into his office and give the orders . He did n't know what he was going to do about it , nor did he care . All he mattered other than seeing that the General was the last one still standing .   --   At noon , the General stood there for the first time . He was n't really used to that . He had n't even used a weapon in years . He did n't know what he was going to do about it . He had n't had a weapon in years . He did n't know what he was going to do about it .   He walked slowly towards the general , as he was about to fire . As he was about to fire , his men burst into the general 's desk , screaming commands . But the General did n't even give a single word . He just stared down at his men . He knew that his men were dying , and he was n't going to let them die with him .   --   It was a bit late , I was just a little busy from my writing prompt . I 'll keep typing if any of you have any suggestions or suggestions ! 
I did n't expect the jump in time . The doors opened and shut , and I was left hanging on the edge of the ship in the middle of the night .   As I stood up , I began to notice that the lights were out . I was n't sure what to do , but I knew I could get some rest .   Looking around , I saw the planet was n't so bad . Not that it really was , for the longest time I was stuck on it . There was plenty of crops . Even plenty of animals .   I reached out and touched them . It felt like my hand touched a stone . I touched it again and again with my own , but to no avail .   I got up in a panic , and made for the door . But instead of opening it , I slipped some of the energy in . I reached for it , and found something stuck on the ground . It did n't hurt .   I followed it up to the door . It seemed strange , but when I looked behind me , it was still in place .   Finally , I found the door . In a small group of people , I had tried to explain to my wife and kids .   `` These humans are going to destroy the planet . We need to make it safe , '' said the elders . `` There is n't much time left . We need to let them live . ''   `` But how ? '' I asked , `` What if they destroy what we have created ? ''   `` They killed the earth , '' said the elders . `` And we need to rebuild it . ''
`` I 'm going to die . ''   I walked through the door , the wind howling in my hair . There was a light shining through the blinds in my room , and there was a sound similar to a woman 's laughter . She was hunched over a keyboard , her hands clasped behind her back . Her eyes were closed , her face hidden behind a veil of clouds .   `` I 'm going to die . ''   `` I 'm going to die . ''   `` You live forever . You 're a burden burdened with your mortality . ''   She paused , her eyes wide . Some sort of grimace curled up on her face . My breathing became shallow , and I could feel the sweat forming under my forehead on my shirt . I tried to keep my hands from shaking , but I could n't . My knees ached and I wanted to reach for my phone , but I could n't . I could n't go anywhere .   `` I 'm going to die . ''   `` Did you hear that ? '' I asked , rising slowly . I could hear the silence in the classroom , the anticipation on her faces . I wondered if ...   `` I 'm going to die . ''   I closed my eyes . I dreamed of moving , but I could n't . I could n't move . I could n't go .   `` You live forever . You 're a burden burden burden burden burdened with your mortality . ''   When I opened my eyes , I was in bed , clutching the thin blanket up in one hand . My life was no longer a shadow of my own , but instead a silhouette of the woman . She was still smiling , her face obscured by a veil of clouds .   I blinked , and gasped .   `` You live forever . ''   The woman stared at me , tears forming on her cheeks . When I opened my eyes , she was in a blue room . She had a white chair , filled with books and cups . She held a wooden chair in front of her , and the woman read a long series of short stories .   `` Why am I here ? ''   The woman reached the top of the bookshelves , and a small box sat in the middle of the room .   `` Why is this happening to me ? ''   The woman looked at her hands again .   `` Why is this happening to me ? ''   `` Because you live forever . ''   `` Why is this happening to me ? ''   She placed a hand on my shoulder . I shook my head .   `` Because you live forever . You live forever . You live forever . You live forever . You live forever . You live forever . And one day ... ''   `` Are you sure ? ''   She put her hand on my shoulder again .   `` No . ''   She pulled my hand away .   `` Do you know why ? ''   I looked at my arm .   `` Because you live forever . The same reason you have been here for eternity , because one day you will die . ''   I nodded .   I said a prayer .
James stared at his dinner , the food he had been eating for nearly a day , the food he had been craving even longer .   `` Why are you eating ? ''   James was hungry .   He would never forget the hunger from his grandmother when he was a little boy .   When he was a teenager , she died . She buried her head in her hands . She died , and on the last day of her life , she ate herself .   It was almost as if his stomach swallowed the food he had been missing .   He remembered his grandmother 's face . He was so hungry . The hunger persisted unabated . He ate .   He did n't know what to expect from his restaurant .   Then something caught his eye .   A meatball .   James did n't believe it , but he was sure he would be able to eat it .   James set down his food on the table . An old woman with a child , the woman walked around the restaurant . `` Hello ? ''   James nodded .   `` Excuse me , '' she said , lowering her children . `` Are you James ? ''   `` Yes , '' he said , adjusting his glasses . `` I am James . ''   `` Hi James ! I am so hungry ! ''   `` Yes ? But you are James A.I.T . James , right ? ''   `` Yes , '' he said , placing his food down on the table . `` I am James A.I.T . James . ''   `` Well , '' she said , `` I do n't have much time . ''   James lifted his hand , and she opened an envelope . `` This is from my father . ''   `` James A.I.T . James , '' she said . `` He left early today . He never arrived for work . ''   `` Yes , '' James said , setting down his drink . `` But , I am hungry . ''   `` Yes , '' she said , and stood up . `` Go to work . You see , I am James A.I.T . ''   James went to work at a fast food restaurant . His boss , a stern looking man , would always ask James if he was hungry . James was n't . He went to work , and his boss did the same .   When he looked at the food , he did n't think much of it . The food was gone . He went home .   James sat down at the computer .   He flipped through his work sheets .   He was n't hungry , and so he decided to eat a sandwich .   James flipped through the last pages of the newspaper he had been reading .   The headline read , `` Fourteenteen Meatballs and a Dead grandmother ''   James ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   He ate .   His body ached , and he thought about the world around him . He thought about walking away . He thought about what he had done to deserve that title . He thought about having a family legacy .   He thought about talking to his wife . He thought about it . He thought about all the things he had done to deserve that title .   He thought about what he had done to deserve that title . James thought about the choices he had made .   He thought about what he had made .   James breathed deeply . His eyes flicked open . He could see the image of her daughter , standing at the wheel .   James looked into her eyes .   He breathed deeply .   He looked at his wife .   He looked at his wife .   He breathed deeply .   He inhaled deeply .   He exhaled .   He breathed deeply .   He breathed deeply .

`` What the hell is wrong with you ? '' Harold asked to his roommate .   `` It 's just that it 's not going to work you know . The last time it happened the demon was trapped in a lava pit with his friend Charlie . I was watching them get into the pit to begin training . Charlie was playing with something and I jumped in . I wanted to scream so bad as to kill him . I heard the screams of them . '' said a red demon .   `` I 've got no way to tell you this , he has to be sent to the underworld . '' said another demon .   `` Yeah , you 're absolutely right right . These were bad dreams . '' Harold explained to the demon .   `` Yes , I know , but what I 'm telling you is that he likes to go to hell and never stays in the pit . Because it 's not like he 's living in Earth anymore .

I 'm here to show you what the real hell is . The real hell is a place where people have to hide and live in the real world . ''
I was n't born in the wrong forest . In fact , it was n't surprising for me , I was quite just what I remember of my parents . A few years after I was a child I was still quite aware of the names I spent my youth dreaming of . I remembered the smell . The wind . The smell of my father , and the taste of my mother 's cooking soup . I recalled the feel of the wind in my feet . I remembered how cold the sky was . I remembered the smells in my room , and how I had been in the hospital for the past few weeks .   I remembered how there had been no noises . I remembered that I could vaguely hear my mom 's voice through my headphones . I remember that she was n't the only one that was awake . I remembered how she sat and watched all the news channels . I remembered how she had turned her eyes to me . I remembered the way she looked at me when I opened my eyes . I remembered how her smile was so infectious . I remembered how sad it had been to be alone with my father if he had died that day .   But my mother was gone . The day she turned her attention back to me , she moved on to a different world . What her father had written had just started to get old . What he had written seemed to have faded from memory to memory , until the day I chose to believe him . I 've tried every thing I could think to ask what he meant by those words . I 've taken every precaution I could think of to ensure I could hear what he meant . I 've tried everything I could think of to make sure it did n't happen . I 've tried anything I could think of to prevent the inevitable from happening , but nothing comes out the same way . No matter what I try , I do n't know how .   The day I told my mother I loved her , and told that I loved her , I did n't know how it could be . I did n't know how much there was left between us .   The day my mother was gone , I told her I loved her , and I did n't know how to answer . I did n't know what I could do to stop all this . I did n't know what to do . I did n't know what to do .   The day I found out that I loved her , I told my mother I loved her , and for the last time , I told myself I loved her .
As my vision faded , I felt her hands on my shoulders .   Dear lord , I can ’ t take it anymore .   I ’ m leaving . Not back .   “ You know what , sweetie ? ” she whispered , eyes wide with worry . “ I ’ m just not thinking about the consequences anymore . You ’ ll just… ”   “ I always do , sweetie , ” I say , “ I ’ ve lived a good life , alright ? And I ca n't have people getting hurt , or hurt ... to be honest with you. ”   Her fingers brush my back , wrapping around my ribs . “ Thanks , honey . Come on . I ’ ll get you dinner before bed. ”   My life ’ s only been so very much better .   The young woman next to me , my grandpa , turns over and says , “ You weren ’ t thinking about that . Your mom said I couldn ’ t have kids , did you ? ” She turns back around , tears rolling down her cheeks . “ Don ’ t cry , man . Everyone else thinks about you. ”   I look up , and kiss her on the cheek , trying to keep my eyes closed .   “ I ’ ll go see the doctors , ” I whisper as I close my eyes .   “ Don ’ t worry , dear , ” she told me , reaching around my side . “ I ’ m going to be with you soon . Love you. ”   I felt her lips take my hair , and I screamed as I wrapped my arms around her . 
`` I have a meeting with the President of the United States at 5:00 PM , '' the voice rang out .   `` Just wait ! '' Paul yelled , turning around and making his way towards the podium . He was seated in the back row , facing down a large group of officers who were also stationed near the presidential podium . Paul walked up to them and asked them if they would mind taking the stage .   They agreed .   The stage was large and spacious and the President of the United States was seated in the back very well . Paul extended his hand and asked them what they were doing . He put his hand over his chest , then looked up at the camera . He laughed and waved it off .   `` Oh , it 's just us , '' he said , turning back to the camera . `` You 'll really appreciate the gesture , Paul . ''   Paul 's laughter dissipated a little . He looked around the room . `` Well , it 's just us again . ''   The crowd cheered .
`` Okay guys there ! '' said the intern . The intern had never been a fan of Rocket League before , but he did n't have problems with dealing with it often , because he was a team person and he had never met anyone else . `` I wanted to be a Rocket League . ''   `` Oh , that 's great . '' said The Rocket League representative . `` I 'm sorry , but I just want you to know that right now I do n't understand . I was in the business of just a Rocket League player . ''   `` Yeah , well , '' said The Rocket League representative . `` But you really should n't have had that thing . You got to have been a Rocket League player . ''   `` Yeah , I was . '' said The Rocket League representative . `` But since you did n't get a license from the law you had to be a Rocket League player . ''   `` Hey , I know . '' said The Rocket League representative . `` Please come and sit down . We 're not looking for any trouble anytime soon . ''   The intern sat down and the door closed behind him . He smiled . `` I 'm no trouble ... ''   Hours later , the intern showed up at the office . `` Hey , I did some research on you ... '' he said . `` Do n't be rude , I actually discovered why this was your thing . ''   On the table he saw Rocket League 's logo . `` Team Rocket League ! '' it said . The intern smiled and smiled back . `` Hey , I did some research on you on Professor Oak himself . ''   `` What ? '' said The Rocket League representative .   `` Apparently I 'm able to help you out on your own . '' The intern walked over to The Rocket League representative . `` So , have you been into Team Rocket again ? I know you 're worried about them . I think you 've been into them for a while . ''   `` Sure , '' said The Rocket League representative . He was happy with his new job and he would n't have to worry about The Rocket League again . `` I 'm still a Rocket League player . ''
`` Do you have a suggestion , sir ? ''   `` No , '' I said .   `` Please , '' said the doctor . `` In order for us to examine the subject 's condition , our experiment must be complete . ''   `` Thank you , sir . '' I said .   The doctor tapped something on his clipboard . `` The subject 's condition is - '' he started .   `` -*possible* ? ! '' I protested .   `` Yes , sir . '' The computer screen flickered to life .   `` This is a simulation , sir . ''   `` Yes , sir . ''   `` Please , let us begin . '' I said , my voice cracking .   `` And , sir , I would like to begin my simulation by removing the subject 's body of the subject . ''   `` You should not ! '' shouted the doctor . `` It is a body . ''   `` I do not , '' I protested . `` What kind of body would a human be ? ''   `` I do not understand . ''   `` So , '' said the doctor , his voice hoarse , `` Is there something you want to know ? ''   I swallowed . `` I have been asked to remove the subject 's body . ''   `` I want to know what that is ! '' cried the doctor .   `` I do not , '' I said . `` This experiment is not finished . ''   `` Fine , '' he said , taking a small swig of wine from the glass . `` I will see your office in a minute . ''   `` Thank you , sir , '' I said .   He left .   `` -- - ''   *Fourteen years later*   `` What ? * '' I asked , dropping the phone . `` What 's happening ? ''   The doctor shook his head . `` You know , '' he said , `` It 's all he knows . ''   `` I 'll be back to you in that moment , '' I told him .   `` I told you to stay away from the computer , '' he said .   `` I know , '' I said , stopping at the door . `` Sir , you see -- ''   `` Jesus , Sam , '' I shouted . `` You 're here . ''   `` I have to -- ''   `` Why are you here ? ''   A loud , resounding bang interrupted my silence . A nurse opened her mouth . `` She 's bleeding . ''   `` What ? ! '' I screamed .   The nurse reached into her pocket . `` Sam ! '' she cried . `` The screen is blurring . '' She pulled out a picture .   `` Hey ! '' I said . `` Sam , you must be bleeding , Sam , remember what I said ? ''   `` Please , '' she said , her eyes glazed over . `` I have to ask you something . ''   I looked around at the crowd . `` Please , '' I tried to say . `` Please , do n't hurt me ! ''   Suddenly , a bullet went through the doctor 's chest . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked .   `` I said stop . ''   `` What ? What ? ! ''   `` The Matrix ! ''   `` Do n't you know what it is , Sam ? ''   `` I do ! '' I said , my breath getting faster . I turned and ran again .   I ran past the doctor 's body , past the computer 's computer 's computer 's computer 's computer , to the machine 's machine 's one-way mirror . My legs were trembling . It took me a few steps before I fell to the ground .   The machine 's camera whirred , and the screen flickered with life . The nurse stood and stroked the back of my head .   `` Thank you , '' she said . `` It 's all you know . ''   I was back on the front porch , still in the middle of a field . They were n't there . I got outside , pulled out a rifle , and went to the front door .   `` Come with me , Jack , '' said a soft voice . I opened the door and was met with an enormous
It 's night time . The sky is dark and the darkness inside the house is suffocating . I 'm tired . I know this because I 've recently found a drug that was used on the streets of New York City . It 's dangerous and the only way to protect it is to get into what 's in New York City and get inside . The only way to get out is to get into it . I 'm alone now .   I need to do what 's in New York City . I need to wake up . A moment of hesitation passes , and I 'm ready . I 'm not nervous . The urge is stronger than my gut .

I feel ... calm . No reaction . I just lie there .   My leg comes out of nowhere . It hits the ground , and I 'm lying in bed . I 'm still in bed . It hurts . It hurts .   It feels like I 'm dying . I keep lying in bed . It hurts .   I 'm not nervous but I 'm not frightened . I love being in bed . I love seeing the darkness and the pain I 've caused . I love seeing the stars . I love seeing the people I once knew . I love seeing them and everything ... I 'm scared .   I feel like I 'm drifting away . I 'm getting close to death . I 'm getting close . I 'm coming home .   I hear the door creak open . I do n't know what to do . I only want to wake up .   I open the door and look outside .   The street is dark and the darkness inside the house is suffocating . I 'm tired . I know this because I 've recently found a drug that was used on the streets of New York City . It 's dangerous and the only way to get out is to get inside . The only thing that 's in New York City is to get inside . A moment of hesitation passes , and I 'm ready .   I 'm not nervous but I 'm not scared . I feel like I 'm going to die . It hurts . But I ca n't die . I feel like I 'm going to die . I 'm just ... lying in bed . It hurts .   I 'm not nervous but I 'm not scared . I 'm anxious . I 'm just ... lying in bed . I 'm just ... sleeping .   I ca n't die . I ca n't die . I 'm just ... lying in bed .   I 'm not nervous but I 'm not scared , but I 'm not scared . I 'm just ... lying in bed . I 'm just ... laying in bed .   I do n't know what to do . I 'm not nervous but I 'm not scared , but I 'm not scared . I 'm just ... lying in bed .   I 'm not nervous but I 'm not scared . I 'm just ... lying in fucking bed . I ca n't die , I ca n't die . I 'm just ... dead .   I 'm not scared anymore . I 'm not scared anymore . I 'm just ... lying in fucking bed . I 'm dead .   I 'm not scared anymore . I 'm ... dead . I 'm ... dead . I 'm dead .   I 'm still home . I 'm still ... still ... dead . I 'm still alive .
They came into the room with a heavy heart . They were cold , with the exception of a bright green light coming from the end of the ship 's door . It was just a matter of time before they attacked again . To say they would be surprised would be an understatement . At least I think so .   I woke up with a splitting headache , my vision sweltering and my ears ringing . I thought the captain was out of his mind . Or maybe it was just the headache . I grabbed a towel from the bedside table and stumbled into the bathroom .   All I could see was a dark fog coming from the other side of the door . It must 've been dark when I hit the water , it almost seemed like it was getting bigger . Then I saw it . I could see it in the distance . No matter how much I tried to take in , I could n't get any more out of the way .   `` Captain ! '' I heard a woman 's voice . I looked behind me and saw her . She was holding something in her hands . It was a gold scythe .   `` I think it 's a ... a mace ? '' I asked . I could n't tell what it was , but I saw things in it . It was metal . It was made from something similar to a star that pierced through the clouds and shattered several windows .   `` Hmph , '' she muttered , giving me a blank expression .   `` There 's two , '' I answered .   `` What ? '' She asked .   `` What is that ? '' I asked .   `` It 's a mace . That 's the one that broke through the storm . ''   `` What are they doing ? '' I said .   `` I do n't know , '' she said . `` I do n't know if there 's anyone else to help . ''   `` You have to help us ! '' I shouted . I found myself feeling silly . More than stupid , the thought of being around this giant ship made me laugh . Whoa . I wish this ship could see so much more .   She gripped an object above her head and pulled it away . `` Get out of here ! '' She yelled .   I looked back out the door . It was full of water , and I could hear the sound of sirens . Then I saw her . She stood alone in the darkness . When I looked back at her , she was staring blankly at the scythe . It was beautiful . And I could n't see this .   Suddenly , the ship burst into flames and came to a rest after it . But the sirens did n't stop . I had to retreat . I looked around the room again . The siren was gone .   This could be real . I knew it . It was definitely real . It had to be . I grabbed a towel and ran to the other side of the door , still struggling to get it open . There was a loud sound as my body was burned . My lungs burned as I tried to get out of the boat . I thought it could have been real . Then the siren came back .   `` I think it 's a ... ''
The first thing I noticed was the scar that dripped down my arms .   I 'd always taken this interest in getting in trouble .   I was a good kid . I was n't mean for trouble at all .   My little sister would have laughed if she 'd known what was going on . It was her favorite play to play .   When I first got in trouble , my sister would run at me and yell at me . It was a long word and my sister was n't responding to it .   When we asked my sister what it was , she 'd just say that she 'd seen a monster rip out their arms and run out .   We had to start laughing . I was n't so sure of how it worked but I did n't care .   I wanted to get involved . I wanted *to* *help* . I wanted to be strong enough to carry out the mission .   My sister and I started dating a few months after I left school .   The first two weeks had been rough . Nothing bad happened .   Eventually , my sister and I were on our way out of the country and into the woods .   Our little apartment complex was only a few blocks away . I was thinking about something .   The first thing I noticed was that the scar on my arms was n't getting any thicker .   *Was n't that just part of my childhood ? *   I thought to myself . Was it a small part of my past ?   My sister walked to the door and began peeling herself off .   I walked to her and her whole arm was still on the floor .   *How ... *   I did n't put much thought into it . The scar on my arms was big .   My sister never spoke to me .
I hate cats . Every day , as the sun rises , I find myself having nightmares . I 've put too much sleep into making the worst of it , and I 've gotten too tired to start making any progress .  After the first few weeks , I started to think I had a visitor .  I tried to call him a cat , but he had nothing . That was okay . I 'd gotten him so used to sleep around the house , but at the same time , it was different . He would n't move . Not because of the lack of movement , but because it was as if he were watching his every move .  After a week and a half , he 'd started to sleep much more and I did n't know how to deal with this . I thought he was just there to feed me , but he never really noticed . I did n't believe him either . He was just there to feed me .  When he needed me , he always left me alone . Then one day , I was home alone .  I came home , picked up my phone , and saw an address .  `` This is the house of my cat '' 
It was a bit of a joke from the beginning .   One day , while waiting for my turn on the school bus when I heard their usual song , I was on the way home from work . It was from my girlfriend 's pop song . I had n't heard it , since I was a teenager . I started to talk to one of the girls while I was still listening . It was the best thing that could happen to me , at this point . I began to wonder if she had been there for me . She told me that she always hated singing . But on that day , she was gone , and I was left alone .   For a long time , I was watching her . I did n't know what to do , neither did my girlfriend . She walked by the school bus . She was talking to my girlfriend about music . But she kept walking . I could n't hear her anymore . I just kept walking .   Eventually , the music started to get louder , and louder . I got worried . Was I hearing her ? Was she serious ? I kept walking . Eventually , I reached the end of the road that I had been walking on .   There she was , standing in the open road . She put on her headphones and was humming . I did n't understand what was happening , but I knew that she had been there for me . But I could n't listen anymore . I did n't give a shit . I was gon na die , and I was gon na die .   I began to walk towards her . I was n't going to die of panic , I was going to die of loneliness . Her music was louder and louder . But still , her music kept getting closer and closer . I started to hear things .   I started going to the radio station that had been playing `` The Sound of Music '' . It was a really simple song , just like the rest of the songs in the books . It was playing a few chords that I had never heard before . I noticed that the song was now in the background . I went around the station , but the background was growing stronger . Then , it was gone .   I found it harder to hear her loud music anymore . By this point , the music was starting to get louder and stronger . I walked along and heard many more notes . Then , one day , I realized that it was time to get home . I walked to the kitchen , and I heard a note . It was the song that had started playing . I walked over , and I heard it again . It was louder now , but still , and I ran towards her .   I finally broke out of the trance that I had been in at this point . I grabbed her shirt , and kept going . I reached the end of the road and ran towards her . She was n't listening to the music anymore .   Days passed . I continued to walk . I did n't understand how much longer she would be in the woods . I kept walking . Eventually , I stopped , and I saw a light at the end of the road . I knew it was her . So I ran back to the car .   I was still in the car , and I could n't hear her anymore . She was humming a beautiful tune . I was still thinking of her songs . I just kept walking . Eventually , I reached the end of the road and stopped , and I saw her again .   I sat at my car and started playing the songs I had used to listen to . I started to hear them . I was starting to realize that they was everything in my life . I realized that there was nothing ever going to happen to me . I wanted to die , so I just kept playing . I started to have fun and did all the things I had dreamed of ever day .
*There ’ s a problem with the Deep Blue , * I told myself . *The…I can ’ t find a way to call it anything else . It doesn ’ t sound…but it ’ s a bad thing . * I set down my trusty camera on the edge of the bed , put it under my pillow and clicked on the light to see if any of the cameras were rolling . “ What ’ s going on ? ” I asked , looking at the screen .   *We tried moving the servers to the surface , but they wouldn ’ t work . * I thought again . “ I ’ m sure they ’ re fine , ” I said , grabbing my camera and turning off the lights . “ What ’ s that noise ? ” I said , pointing my head in the direction of the noise .   “ It ’ s coming from Mars , ” one of the scientists said . His voice was a low and grating , almost robotic . I looked behind me to see if anyone was watching and they all turned towards me . “ I got news , ” he said slowly . “ I ’ m going to call NASA to see what they ’ re doing . I don ’ t know how to respond , so I ’ ll send a message to…well…here. ”   “ Yes , sir , ” I replied , staring at the screen for a moment . “ Can you repeat that word ... ” I paused for dramatic effect , then continued .   “ The…I don ’ t know…what � of it ? ” asked one of the scientists .   “ I think I ’ m seeing the most interesting thing in this world , sir , ” I replied , feeling a little intimidated at the fact that I knew the best way to describe the situation was simply not to tell anyone . I took the opportunity to ask the scientists to repeat their earlier statement . “ Mars , can you tell us what is going on and what this means for you ? ”   “ It means… ” one of the scientists said . “ At first , I didn ’ t know what to do. ”   “ Mars , can you tell us what is going on ? ” asked one of the scientists .   “ I feel like I ’ m being watched , ” I said . “ Can you look at me ? ”   “ Can you make a call to… ” the first one started . I was halfway through telling the scientist to give me a call after the first attempt and he told me that he had a team of engineers following him , but he didn ’ t mention the red lights that were beginning to be flashing with every second . He also said he was going to ask me how I felt , especially without the red lights .   “ I think it ’ s just seeing the most interesting thing in this world…I mean , how can anybody see what ’ s going on ? ”   “ I think it ’ s just seeing the most interesting thing in this world . I ’ ll call NASA , at least . We ’ ll send a contact to…well…here. ”   “ Please , don ’ t you mean the…the RED light ? ”   “ Yes , sir , I mean…I feel it ’ s coming from…I think I ’ m seeing the most interesting thing in this world , ” I smiled . “ At first , I ’ d think it ’ d be nice to see…that look of… that…of…that I ’ m seeing . But when I look at it , it feels…off. ”   “ I don ’ t think it is , ” the scientist said , his voice getting quieter . He looked at my camera and then back at me. “ I ’ m guessing…it ’ s been a while . But…I ’ m sure it looks like something is going on. ”   “ You ’ re sure that ’ s…the very point where you ’ re going to be able to tell me what really is going on ? ”   “ Well , sir , I ’ ve been watching this TV for months now , ” I said softly . I looked back at my own camera and smiled . “ I ’ m sure you ’ ve heard the stories . I ’ m sure that ’ s something that is happening to you
It was n't just that I was working with Frank , it was that I was the only person that had any idea what was going on . Every day I would listen to his shit talk , `` Frank did it to save the world ! He saved the world ! '' Well , I guess that 's what he told me when I was a child . After that , it really started to come to my head .   Frank is what we call him . He actually had the ability to jump from tree to tree . And he used to have a super strength which made him incredibly difficult to deal with . Anyway , he used to use it for his own gain . Now , whenever he was in front of the building or sitting in the middle of it , he used his super power to fly down the building and beat anything he could get near the top of the building . He would then jump around in a super jump that would almost hit the ground .   He was also known as a super villain who used his super strength to stop villains from killing each other . It did n't help that he was a bit of a dick , so he would often use his super strength for good . Then one day , he decided he was going to use his super strength to beat a villain who worked with him . Frank was n't even listening to me . He was talking to himself .   I did n't have to worry about Frank anymore . I had nothing important that Frank was seeing . I just focused on keeping Frank occupied , and keeping anything that might have been beneficial to him .   It 's been a couple months now . Frank is gone now and just sits and talks . I do n't really know why the company is calling me that . I do n't really know why anything is happening .   I actually think that 's why I like Frank . He reminds me of my dad .
`` What can I do for you today ? ''   `` Well I must confess to the matter of the fallout . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I mean , everyone has their own issues with this all . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Well , the first one is that I am not ... I am not the strongest wizard in the land ! ''   `` Is this bullshit ? ''   `` Well if you are n't like me , you are n't the smartest . ''   `` That is bullshit . ''   `` That is the problem . ''   `` I do n't care if your magic does n't work like this . ''   `` Well , I do n't care if you have magic that does n't work , it does anyway . You ca n't just *change* anything , you have to stay with your magicians . ''   `` So , if that does n't work then why did you have to tell me ? ''   `` Because ... because you can never *change anything* , you have to go with it . ''   `` Because you *just* have to stay alive ! ''   `` What ? ''   `` That 's the problem , the problem , the problem , the problem . ''   `` Why have you never ever told me ? ''   `` Because I 'm dead , and I 'm going to die again . ''   `` Why could n't you just ask me some more questions ? ''   `` Because I 'm dead . Do n't say that on me , just ask me some more questions . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because ... I do n't know . I 'm still alive . ''   `` You make me think you are dead , and you do n't want me to live . ''   `` I know . ''   `` Well it just seems like you have to live with it . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I have to stay alive . ''
“ This is ridiculous , I… ”   The man threw his arm against the wall , twisting it back and forth . “ We must start from the beginning . He will kill us . It is our duty to stop him ! ”   The man struggled to find his words . His chest heaved in protest . His heart beat faster and faster , the rhythm threatening to break his heart as he tried to speak .   “ I can ’ t , I can ’ t… ”   “ He will kill us . He will kill us all. ”   He looked around to see if anyone else had noticed . They all gave him a blank stare .   “ Nobody else would ever have the guts to join him ! ”   The man had fallen silent , but he couldn ’ t stop himself . He had known that he would never find a peace in his life . He had even known that he would never find the solace in death until his soul did grow weak again .   The man had known at first what he had to do . He had wanted to save the world . He wanted to make that peace . He had wanted to make it all a lie , and stop him .   But he was powerless . He had to do what he had to .   He was surrounded by the crowd . They were all looking at him , one by one .   “ He ’ s… ” He took a deep breath , trying to calm down . “ He ’ s not fucking with us . He ’ s… He has… ”   “ He ’ s… ” One of the people shouted at him . Another began to walk towards him , their hands covering their faces . A man stood two metres closer .   “ He ’ s… ”   “ He ’ s… He has… He ’ s… ”   His body shook violently as his vision blurred . He heard one of the crowd whisper , and the man fell to his knees . The man looked up at him .   “ He ’ s… ”   “ He ’ s… ” He wheezed . “ He ’ s… ”   “ He… He ’ s… ”   “ He ’ s… ”   “ He ’ s… ”   “ He ’ S… ”   “ He ’ s… ”   “ He ’ s… ”   “ He ’ s… ”   And the woman started to cry .   He felt a sharp pain in his side . He rose up , running . He ran through the crowd , through the crowd , through the crowds and up to his house . He ran into the kitchen . He ran out into the living room that was in the kitchen . He ran back into the living room . He ran into his room .   The man wasn ’ t breathing . He was motionless . He didn ’ t move . The man didn ’ t move . He just stared at the floor , his eyes wide with terror . He was alive .   He was dead . He was alive .
`` We have arrived at the planet , the planet of the apex predator ! '' The creature , a large alien , stood at the center of the stage , a green-green and blue display of `` Planet Earth '' in front of him .  `` Why this planet ? '' The alien continued to look at the display . `` It appears that the apex predator is a highly intelligent species , and has made its presence known across the planet . ''  `` How ? How does that make any sense ? ''  `` With a simple observation , the apex predator has found a way to make the atmosphere that it has discovered in its entirety be toxic to any life form . It discovered that once a certain method of life was introduced , there needed to be poison in the atmosphere for this method of life . The apex predator took these methods in vain , but their efforts were lost . ''  `` How ? ''  `` From the time they could n't control their cells , they used the poison to create a deadly toxin that killed all life . This toxin made the entire planet toxic , and the planet destroyed . Every life form was destroyed , and the apex predator tried to destroy it as an act of war . But instead of destroying the planet , it destroyed the planet in a single motion , destroying the life forms on it . The apex predator died from a stroke of luck . ''  `` Wait , '' Said the creature .  `` Only an hour is until the planet is destroyed . ''  `` There must be something wrong , '' Asked the creature .  `` What 's wrong ? '' Asked the creature .  `` The prey is still being murdered by the apex predator , and has no way to escape . They must find it ! '' The alien paused , and in front of the stage , the display displayed a massive display of `` Planet Earth '' , and the creature stood still .
Drip drip , drip drip drip . He tried to breathe . He tried to move . Finally , he could move .   His breaths were shallow , shallow indeed . He sighed and rolled onto his back . He waited a while , breathing quick , breathing deeper into his lungs , trying not to let the fog show in . He inhaled deeply and exhaled heavily . He glanced forward and gazed onto the distance all the while . A lone cloud was slowly dying away , and seemingly floating in the air above him .   He looked around for the source of the sound , for it seemed to lack any semblance of life in the air for him . He looked back up , trying to find a trail of sorts behind him .   He kept on walking , just as he had been every day for nearly a year now . He 'd been running for almost two years now , in the hope that he 'd find someone to help . The path had been clear , and he had n't been looking at a single cloud . The only landmarks he 'd seen since he 'd first left his home were the cityscape , and it was always dark and rainy inside his house .   The only thing that had made it clear was the only thing that made it clear to him how close he was . He 'd been in the middle of nothing for almost two years now , just as he had been every day for almost a year now . The only thing that made it clear to him how close he was was anymore .   He felt the cold sensation of his chest start to tighten . He closed his eyes and began to think . He thought about telling anyone that he 'd seen something like this before . He imagined what he 'd done . The first time he 'd seen something like that , he 'd looked around . He 'd seen a pile of trash before , he 'd been standing near it next to a tall building . He 'd seen several people that had taken up residence in it , but none of them had been able to stay . Neither had anyone left to help .   He took in a deep breath , and let off a deep groan . He closed his eyes again , trying not to let the fog show . He inhaled once more , this time even more deeply . He exhaled deeply , this time even harder . He exhaled deeply and exhaled more deeply , this time even harder .   Finally , he looked up at the cloud that he 'd just been standing on . He could see the entire building , from its top to the bottom of the building askew . He went to run , but it felt like he would n't continue running . Still , he kept pushing onward . Soon , he would be dead , and that would be over . He just had n't known what he 'd see .   ____    A dull tingling in his chest came back to him as the wind returned . He looked over at the clouds , and saw the remnants of the city he 'd just left . He smiled and wiped a tear away . He saw the last of that dust , from the ruin that he 'd just walked through , and fell to his knees .   `` Thank you . '' He whispered . He wiped away only the last of the dust from the outside world , staring out into the emptiness of the galaxy . He thought about how close he was now , and how he 'd been every day for almost a year now .
*What is it you want again ? *   I reach over , reach across the toilet lid , reach to pull out the top , put my hand to my chin , and pull back , pulling slowly . There is a loud noise coming from behind me .   *No ! You 're not going to come back ! *   I step back a bit , trying not to look at the ceiling , trying to not look at the floor . I keep pulling backwards , but I ca n't seem to pull my hand back . I try again and again . I 'm not pulling back .   *Do n't pull back ! *   I move my finger , but my finger is not on anything .   *No , you 're not going to come back ! *   I 'm not being pulled back . I 'm still pulling my hand away .   *Do n't pull back ! *   I pull my hand back .   *Come back ! Come back ! *   I do n't feel anything . I 'm still pulling my hand away .   *It 's ok , I 'm fine . *
I 'm not sure if a little too much is being said . I remember speaking to my girlfriend on the phone , she was very upset , but apparently she said that my girlfriend is an `` angel '' . She then added that she likes `` real '' angels . She seemed to care that I preferred some angels . I think that is what the most well known part of her face is , but it 's only because she is a demon . She 's not a demon , she looks like she 's just a little monster . She has the eyes of a person . She appears to look kind and gentle , a little too much .   So I did n't ask much , I was just curious . I was , however , bored . I could just say `` I do n't like dragons , but they do have the same color '' but it was more of an `` okay '' word than anything else . I would n't have to ask for anything else . It was all fun and games to play , so I ended up having my fun , I 'm sure .   When I finally decided to play the games , I went from player to player , but when I started to play , people had an even greater appreciation for me . I played with the people on the phone , usually the demons that lived there . Sometimes the demons were just the damned people , but the people that were n't truly demons .   One day , a tall , scary , tall , skinny demon went off to kill an old friend . He came back from dead . I tried to put the pieces together , but it did n't work .    **TL ; DR : Why did he kill me ? **
`` So ... your grandfather died ? '' I ask , still not sure what to say .   `` Nah . ''   I ca n't help but feel nervous . This stranger is obviously uncomfortable and has n't been in the elevator since the year 1930 . I can only describe him as Hitler , who I am unsure of .   `` His name was Gringer-Hollen . ''   I open my mouth to talk , but he cuts me off .   `` Gringer was a dictator . He was a leader . He built a world that was n't ready for him . ''   He looks at me , confused . Do n't think I have that in my mind . I never planned for this to happen , and I have known about the atrocities committed by these people , but never has I believed that one person of justice could condemn more than two million Jews to death .   `` Gringer was a loyal country , a very good friend of mine . He was n't a man , he never really believed in his religion . He never believed in anything , but he was ... well , it was enough to make him do things , but he did n't want his own personal hell to go to waste . ''   I feel uncomfortable , but not now .   `` So ... You ... ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` But ... ''   `` And that 's why your grandfather was a terrible man . In those days ... ''   `` What ? ''   `` Ah , yes . ''   `` How did you ... kill him ? ''   `` He was a bad man . ''   `` What ? ''   `` He was a monster . ''   No , I knew this one more than any of you did .   We both laugh .   `` So ... there was one man who killed him . He had been a hero , a very good friend of mine . He said he had done good , but in a different way . He said he was going to do better . But ... ''   `` He was a good man . ''   The elevator door opens and I just know that the same man I 've seen before fills the floor behind me .   `` What happened to that man ? '' I ask .   `` He killed himself . ''   `` What ? ''   `` He shot himself . ''
**COUNT One : 2044**   I remember the shock to the American people , my surprise to the Russian . On the contrary , the shock to the American people was rather much more potent . I remember the shock to the Russian and the shock to the American people to the Russian . On the opposite side I remember the shock to the American people to the American people to the Russian . On the opposite side I recall the shock to the Russian . With the United States dead , the United States dead , we had no hope of surviving . The United States was slowly crumbling into ruin .   In a fit of rage , the Russian government launched Operation World War II . With my name on the ballot , I was voted dead . I was voted dead by millions of Americans as part of a war zone , the only one capable of sustaining life . My country was devastated by the loss of such a great nation , and it had taken years for it to recover .   I was voted dead when I was a young adult , and I was eligible for a position in the US Military . I was given the opportunity to prove my worth to the world , and that I was the leader of the United States . I had proven my worth in the US Military , and I was proud to be able to prove my worth in other countries .   I did not care how many years I had held office in the US Military . I had been given two daughters , two grandkids , and three-year-old daughters with whom I truly cared for . I was given a job at a company I could not afford , and a job I I could not afford .   I was given two sons , and a grandkids , and a job I could not afford . I was given two sons , and one grandchild , and a job I could not afford .   I was given two daughters , and one grandchild , and a job I could not afford .   I was given two daughters , and a job I could not afford .   I was given one daughters , and a job I could not afford .   I was given two daughters , and one grandchild , and a job I could not afford .   I was given a job I could never afford .   I was given a job I could never afford .   I was given a job , and one grandchild , and a job I could not afford .   I was given a job , and one grandchild , and a job I could not afford .   I was given a job , and one grandchild , and a job I could not afford .   I was given a job I could not afford . The United States was collapse under the weight of what had once been a great nation .   I was given a job , and one grandchild , and an job I could not afford . 't even a job I could afford .
The jury was staring at me . An absolute fool on a jury of six thousand .   `` Mr , '' the lead prosecutor said , `` I apologize that the jury has taken this case against you . ''   I sighed . I had n't done a thing wrong , it seemed . My cat , I admit , was a bit more than I had expected . He kept on purring and I could easily tell that his behaviour had increased . He was a cute little kitten , so I had gotten to know him best and at least I could have easily had him know that I loved cats .   I turned away from the court proceedings , and made my way out to the side of the court room where the lead prosecutor stood . He looked at me , and I realized that he had been staring at me .   `` Mr , '' he said , `` I apologise for that . ''   I stared at the judge .   `` Did you know that you would be sentenced to death by your own cats ? ''   I nodded .   `` Would n't you be happy if you were ? ''   I bowed my head .   `` Would n't you be happy that all your pets were dead ? ''   I nodded .   `` Would n't you be happy that all your pets were dead ? ''   I nodded .   `` Would n't you be happy that all your pets were dead ? ''   I nodded .   `` Would n't you be happy that all your pets were dead ?

`` Your leaders have gathered . We have assembled to welcome you to our place of worship . ''   It was all so sudden , the chaos was overwhelming . I could feel the adrenaline draining from my body , as I felt my skin turn red and sweat beads trickle down my forehead . As the words left my mouth , I could see my bloodshot eyes turning red , and I felt the panic wash over me faster than I ever had before , and my words were slowly being replaced by hatred .   The leader cleared his throat , said nothing , and started muttering .   `` The name of our Father is Lucifer , and we love him . ''   My eyes nearly hit the ground , I had never seen anything like it . `` My father ... What , what did I do to deserve this , this ? What did I just do ! ? Do you know what I did to deserve this ? ! ''   The leaders voice sounded muffled . `` The power of the lord is in your hands , and you command it to be your own . We will not fall , for this is your will NOW . ''   I could hear the panicked breathing escape as I began to process what had happened .   `` Lucifer '' , I uttered , `` you have taken a very sickening turn against the lord , and our Father has taken the power that you so desperately desired to fulfill . ''   I was confused . I suddenly knew why this was happening , how Satan truly could live like this . `` What do you mean Lucifer 's power ? Jesus , why does the emperor hate me ! ? ! Why could n't this man give us his strength ? ! ''   `` He created me , after all . '' Jesus replied , clearly trying to stop me . `` You were the only one who disobeyed him . ''   Seeing this , the leaders hands relaxed , `` I do n't understand '' , I said , and then suddenly my hands felt cold , and my skin turned red . I glanced around , not to see if anyone was there .   `` What did you do to deserve this ? Did you want him to destroy me ? ! ''   I looked at Jesus again , this time his eyes seemed to be turning red . `` Look , I started this cult back in 1986 . There was n't anything that I wanted , no one wanted a sacrifice , no one wanted me to go through anything like this . Not until I found out my purpose , that I started this cult '' .   I was speechless . My soul was on fire , the sweat was beginning to run down my face , and my body was raving loudly . `` Finally ! '' I yelled . `` I gave up trying to save someone , I gave up trying to put my Father in my hands . I gave up trying to be free , so I could help people ! ''   Jesus had finished speaking , and looked away , he sat down on the floor and hugged me , his tears streaming down his face .   `` I wish that we could have gone back in time , and gone back before you did '' , he said .   `` But ... but that ca n't happen ... '' I exclaimed , crying out .   `` Do n't worry , I 'll be there in a few days . Keep trying to save people , just let me die in peace '' , he said .
The sign above my door was clearly the opposite of what I expected : no , *the opposite* . But what I did expect was *another* sign .   A set of doors that I could easily open from below .   *A lot of people might be asking for something* , I thought .   As I made my way down the stairs , I noticed a group of teenagers , much taller than I , walking in all sorts of strange things .   `` What 's up with these kids ? '' I asked as I continued down the stairs .   The ones that had started talking to me had started talking to me .   *No one should be here , it 's forbidden , * they said .   I looked around . No one else was even standing on the ground , as I walked along .   I continued down the hallway .   I passed another set of doors .   *Was this what it was like ? * I thought . *Was this the place where I ended up ? I do n't remember . *   Soon , I came to the front of the group , and saw a number of lights that were all flashing . I looked at the ceiling .   *Maybe more lights , *I thought .   My heart raced . This was not the place where I ended up . I knew what was happening . I would not understand . I closed my eyes and prepared for what I saw .   *But what , did I just get all this from one side of the mall instead ? * I thought .   Then I heard it .   *The sound of feet hitting concrete . *   I jumped .   *What* ?   It was the sound of foot steps hitting concrete .   `` What the- ''   The footsteps stopped .   *I 'm not crazy* , thought the man in the middle of the room .   `` What the fuck are you talking about ? '' I started , in shock .   `` They 're here . ''   `` Oh God , what do they want ? ''   `` They 're trying to get in here . The mall is in trouble . ''   *What the fuck did this do to me ? * I thought .   `` Are you insane ? ''   The guy in the middle of the room laughed . He held out his hand .   `` What 'd you do ? ! ''   `` Do n't ... ''   `` What ! ? ''   `` I took you hostage . ''   `` You took me hostage ? ! ? I-I do n't know what this- ''   `` Come now , '' said the man in the middle of the room , `` I have to go . ''   `` No . ''   `` No . ''   `` No ! ''   `` NO ! ''   `` NO ! ''   I could feel the impact of the knife .   I was thrown over the counter .   Nothing happened .
We 've been here before . Always been here . The jungle floor is soft , inviting - the sunlight glinting off the leaves in the leaves - the leaves twang in the sunlight . Even when I look at them , they are so soft and precious , I ca n't help but grin as I watch their small bodies bob back and forth towards the sun , their soft blue eyes drifting slightly back and forth as the sun passes below .   I have come to this place before . The jungles are so different now - we 've visited many places before , but I never found another place like this . I felt like I had come here because I saw it all too often , as I entered the jungle where there was a giant oak tree . I watched it slowly , but the trees never changed .   I walked around , holding my rifle up low , looking for my mothers house .   A faint sound . It sounded like an old , beaten-down voice .   `` Come , son . ''   I started forward through the jungle without thinking . I never believed it was there .   I took a deep breath . It felt good to have my mother here .   They looked so peaceful . But there was fear in their eyes . They looked alive and well .   `` Why have you come here ? ''   I paused , remembering why I had come . Did the fear get here ? It was too early .   `` Your mother is gone . ''   I had to think .   `` Are you going to come back ? ''   Silence , of course . They were always gone .   `` What ? Are you here to tell me then ? Speak . ''   They looked confused , before they knew it , the wind was whipping around them and they were falling .   `` Go away . Leave . ''   The wind picked up again as the thunder beat down on them . The trees around them flew away , away from me . I followed suit .   I started the trek again , my hand cradling my rifle , as I walked deeper through the jungle . I followed everything they knew , and from the very end of my life , I felt safe .   When I arrived , I saw our home . It was dark , but I saw it all . There was no moon in the sky . Just dark darkness .   My mother was gone .   The thunder continued again . I had to go back .   I walked deeper into the jungle . I followed everything they knew , and I felt safe .   And I was safe .
She stared down at it . The book seemed to flow , but the ink was barely above the surface .   She could feel it touching her skin , but she did not feel the sensation of coldness . Her feet carried on through the empty library . Her lungs began to fill with the scent of fresh fire . She felt herself begin to struggle , and her vision began to fade .   Her eyes opened , and she looked up at the sun , shining in the fading moonlight shining off the roof of The Library . The entire city was lit with the sun 's light . The building was lit by a single candle , which slowly moved from one corner to the other . The candle was being carried around the light , trying to light everything up .   Her vision was in more trouble than she could remember . Something was n't right . She ran to the door , and there it was . The last thing she saw was her hand . She remembered the word 'click ' , but it was faded away .
So she stood with her hair out and all hell broke loose . She walked up and saw the large , slender group of five members . They made eye contact with her and their cat with their large , thin fur . They held out their hands in a gesture of mutual understanding .   `` We do n't usually do this , '' she said . She raised eyebrow . `` What do you think ? ''   The wolf responded , `` My parents keep telling me they can never be with me . I was just a kitten , and they told me I could never get into the woods without them . They must have told me that if we were n't at each other 's side I could spend ages with them . I do n't remember who , or what , I actually became . ''   One of the bears next to her said the word `` wolf '' and quickly ran away , leaving the pack confused . The other two looked at each other for a few moments before approaching each other ... until one of them spoke , `` I had this weird habit of wearing something different and being just an animal , but I figured I 'd try to be different instead today . ''   The other wolf just stared at the ground . The other wolf looked at the second bear and said , `` We 're here because of their weird behavior . ''   The other bear just looked at the ground , shocked . The other wolf slowly looked at the first Bear , then at the first Bear , and finally at the first Bear . Before anyone could say anything else , a woman with long blonde hair stepped forward . She introduced herself .   `` I am a rabbit . I 've been adopted to this village by Dr. Gai- ''   `` What are you talking about ? '' said the witch .   `` The wolf has been adopted , and we have decided that we can not bear another wolf who makes up his mind . We need to get rid of the old one , and find another , so we can stay together . ''   `` I see , '' said the witch . She pointed at the four , `` So we can get rid of the one who makes us up ? ''   `` The one who makes us up , '' said the wolf . `` That 's right . '' She pointed at the wolf and said , `` I think we 'll call him Wolf . ''   The other wolf just stared , mesmerized . He said , `` I 'm not that kind of rabbit . I 'm just a bunny . ''   `` Well then , if you 're going out with someone else , could you at least give us some advice on how to handle our issues ? ''   The witch looked at her companion , confused . `` I have some questions for you , '' she said . `` Yes , I can answer them all . ''   The wolf looked around in amazement . `` Uhm ... I 'm sorry , '' he began . `` But I do n't really have much time now . We need to find a new family , and I do n't think that 's our responsibility to fix this problem . ''   `` So what do you suggest we do ? '' the witch asked .   `` We go hunt down the wolves who make us up . They wo n't just be lost forever , though . You see , we do n't have any wolf companions . They 're stuck with us . It 's a matter of finding a new family with us . I need to know if we can be with another wolf before one of those wolves makes us up again . ''   `` What did you just say ? '' said the witch . `` You 're a really cute bunny . ''   The wolf stared at her with his large , thin fur . She put her hand on his shoulder and said , `` I 'm so sorry , '' before walking away . The fox looked at her and said , `` It 's okay , '' before leaving the circle .
The hole was a hole that could be seen from the window across the room . There were dark spots along the wall . Had someone dug in here , would they find us ?   `` Hm ? '' I breathed , trying to mask all the excitement in my voice . I was nervous . I was so excited . I was even more nervous than I had been nearly a week ago .   `` Hm , do you think this is the right angle ? '' Commander Houston crackled .   I looked over at the team of explorers . The red flag hanging in the air was red in the most gruesome way . We were going to be landing on Mars in 20 minutes .   I looked back at the team who had fallen to the ground . We had made it to the other side of the hole and made our way to the field where the earth used to be . Our team had no idea the ship had lost entry , but the men who brought it up had been terrified . Everyone had been scared .   They were also scared as well . I felt the fear and the excitement flow to me .   `` Hm , '' Houston said . `` We made it to the other side . ''   I looked outside . That 's when I saw it . A large hole . The hole should be filled . It should be filled with oxygen . I stood there confused . I could n't believe it .   `` Houston , '' I said as if it was n't important . `` What is it ? ''   `` We found something . We found a face . '' Houston said . `` And we found it ? ''   `` I do n't think so , '' I said . `` This is the face of a man with big scarface . ''   `` But where did this come from ? '' Houston asked .   `` He told us of the location of our home planet . '' Houston said . `` You need to bring this up . ''   `` Houston , I do n't think so , '' I said . `` What do you mean you do n't think it was a face ? ''   `` Does that mean ... '' Houston asked .   `` We 've been here for over five years now . ''   `` How did you know ? '' Houston asked .   `` My husband told me of the location of our home planet . ''   `` Where is he ? ''   `` He told us about the location of our home planet . ''   `` Why are you telling me that ? '' Houston asked .   `` Because my husband said we had to bring this up . ''   `` What about him ? ''   `` We have to take him back to where he was born . ''   `` Why are you telling me that ? '' Houston said .   `` Because he told me that he was also a man with a giant scarface . ''   `` What do you mean you did n't think what he said ? ''   `` We brought this up because he told me about the location of our home planet . ''   `` What do you mean , we brought this up because he told me that he was a man with a giant scarface ? ''   The silence was broken by a resounding cry .   `` We put him on this stretcher and carried him to the ground where we found him . ''   They were all crying . We felt we were being lowered into space . The others were sobbing from the tears we just experienced .   `` I 'm sorry sir , but I will never forgive you . You have to bring this up for him . ''   The red flag hung on the wall outside the hole . I just walked out , and stared out the hole . I could n't believe what I was seeing .  
`` No one has ever thought of the concept of war . ''    `` It 's ... it 's a simple concept . ''    The bar was quiet , and the sound of several clangs from the two men in front of me filled the air . No one seemed to hear , though , and they were n't at all surprised to see a man in front of them . The man was taller than me , with a thin mustache . He wore a plain white suit , with the words 'Black ' painted onto it . The stranger was also wearing a dark blue tie with a bright blue collar . The other was wearing a white trench jacket , with a bright red star running in front of it . The stranger was dressed in a black military jacket , with the word 'Black ' painted onto it . The stranger noticed me , and went on .    `` The word war is no longer a concept . ''    The woman in front of me looked puzzled . `` What do you mean , there has n't been any war in the name of war , '' she asked , `` since the Fall of Berlin . ''    `` What are you talking about ? ''    `` What do you mean , there has n't been any war in the name of war , since the Fall of Berlin . ''    The woman stared at me quizzically . `` What do you mean ? ''    `` The Fall of Berlin . You have never seen a war so big . ''    The woman reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a small , green stick , which she struck me with while stabbing my chest . `` It looks like it 's gon na be hard to fight , '' she said with a bright smile . `` You 're gon na hurt yourself , right ? ''    `` Like what ? ''    `` You have n't seen some war , have you ? My head is n't hurt . I am bleeding . It looks like I 'm gon na be fine . Here , let me help you . '' She gave me a small needle , which I used as a bandage . I helped her up .    I sat down on one of the stool in the bar . My helmet was off , and I did n't have many friends . I mostly slept on the stool , and woke up everyday . There were n't any problems .    The woman in front of me looked at me . `` Why did you wake up ? ''    `` I did n't come home . ''    `` I did n't come back ? ''    `` Someone knocked on the door . ''    `` Okay , okay . Not the door . I thought it was a prank . ''    `` Someone knocked on my door . ''    `` Open up ! ''    A man entered the room , wearing a plain white suit . He walked up to me and sat down on the stool next to me . He was holding a large knife , a small knife , and a bright red star running in front of it . He grabbed the knife from the woman 's hand and started stabbing as best he could .    I felt a bit sick . `` Huh ? ''    `` I just woke up . ''    `` What ? ''    `` That is strange , '' the man said . `` I do n't think I killed you . ''    `` Why me ? '' I asked .    A man with a black military jacket walked up to me , holding a knife . It looked like a pistol , with the word 'Black ' painted onto it . A man with a bright blue collar walked up to me . `` You have no weapons . ''    `` What 's wrong with you ? ''    `` I am a soldier . Look I 'm talking to a soldier . I came here to kill someone . ''    `` Why should I fight ? ''    `` I 'm just here to help . ''    `` Who ? ''    `` It 's an enemy . They must be eliminated . ''    `` You ca n't kill them ? ''    `` No , I beg that you come to terms , '' the man said . `` I 've been living here
A soft , almost feminine voice spoke to me the first time I saw her .   `` I 'm so sorry . ''   My eyes grew wide at the sudden sound of her voice , all I could focus on was the small , yet familiar way she kissed me on the cheek .   `` It was n't supposed to happen like this . ''   I smiled at her and quickly forgot it .   `` Do it again . ''   She closed her eyes as a tear welled up in her eye .   `` Do what ? ''   I smiled back at her and quickly grabbed my keys and drove off to my father 's house .   `` I love you , honey . `` , she softly whispered .
After we 'd gone there , Dan , the two of us , told each other about the day . We were waiting , and watching the TV . The weather was hot , and we were n't thirsty , and we just needed to do everything we could before anyone else could wake up .   Some of the guys were looking at us , wondering why we were here , and some wondered why I was the only one . The moment Dan pulled the trigger , I was dead .   We had to do something . We wanted to go back . We wanted to get away .   We got up , and ran to the car . We drove for what seemed like at least two hours before we burst in , screaming and gasping for breath . We were screaming , so loud , that they could n't know you , but they could hear the sound of the engine roaring . We were n't going to get away .   We jumped into the Civic , and the car sped off without a hitch . We were about to be hit by a car . We did n't make it .   Dan had come out when the car smashed into him . He screamed , and his hands were bound behind him . Dan was restrained , so he was n't even able to tell us why he was being held down . He screamed in pain until the guy finally came to his senses . Dan was screaming for help , but he could n't hear us .   After that , we were in bed .   Dan awoke in the morning , and the same thing happened . He had lost consciousness , and was lying in the bed , bleeding . The men walked in . He was barely able to scream anymore , but they helped him up .   We were able to communicate . Dan said `` Why did you do this ? '' The man was surprised , and asked for the help of the police . Dan was a little bit confused , but he saw that they were looking at him for answers . He knew they needed to save him , but did n't know if this man would take them into custody .   `` Because I asked for help .

He had expected it , finally , to be the end of humanity . As the aliens approached , he looked to the sky , and the world watched as the world looked upon him in terror . Then he smiled and said , `` We can change our terms . ''
**April 29 , 2046**   I did n't exactly hope for my daughter to come sooner . She 's a tough one , like me , but she 's still an amazing teenager . She has a lot in her life and thinks she 's smart ... but not really very clever ... and yet , she 's still as pretty and smart as ever . It 's ... okay . I ca n't help but smile at her .   **May 25 , 2046**   She was a friend of mine all my childhood . I ca n't believe it . I hope she likes it . I hope she 's allowed to see her younger self .   **February 15 , 2046**   I found this journal and started writing things down ( not that it 's bad ... but not going to lie and say it 's not ) from the last time we met . The journal is pretty serious , but really ... I 'll try to stop it when I can .   **April 28 , 2046**   Remember that night we met ? It was such a beautiful night ... and then the best things that ever happened to me ... I woke up on a bench and smelled ... good . I think she smelled *right* .   **May 30 , 2047**   After a few months , I can finally really feel her ... but she never likes to mess it up . I always think she 's just a dumb thing . I 'm sorry I ca n't talk to her again ... but I 'll try . I really *love* her .   **May 30 , 2047**   The best happened to me ... and now I have to put it in my memory ... at least for now .   **April 30 , 2047**   I ca n't take it anymore . I 'm scared . I ca n't live with this forever . I never wanted to waste all those years together and live with me ... is n't it sweet ?   **September 17 , 2047**   The worst happened to me . It 's horrible . I ca n't let her go ... I ... She 's going to kill herself , and ... she 's going to kill herself too . I ca n't do this any longer ... this is for the best .   **September 23 , 2047**   I ca n't believe it . The worst of it was just a dream ... and now I ca n't stop it . I ca n't face her again . It 's too hard to stop now ... and I can't do it anymore ... I 'm scared . I ca n't do anything anymore ... and I 'm not going to do it .   **September 24 , 2047**   I love you . I 'm scared , and I 'm not going to do this anymore ... .   **September 25 , 2047**   I think our daughter will finally be enough for us . I 'm scared . So , so , so , so , so sorry . I just ca n't do it anymore ... and I do n't want to face her again ... I 'm scared ...   **September 26 , 2047**   I love you , and I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry ...   **September 27 , 2047**   I am so sorry . I 'm so sorry , and I do n't want her to live with me anymore . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry ... I did n't mean this ... I did n't mean this ...   **September 29 , 2047**   It 's been too long . I am so sorry . I hope she can see me again ... I 'm so sorry .   **September 29 , 2047**   I hope she can see me another day ... Please ... but ...   **September 29 , 2047**   I 'm so sorry . I hope she can see me the way I hope she sees me today ...   **September 29 , 2047*   I love her better than anything else ... I 'm so sorry . I hope she can see me through this ... I 've been so ... so selfish .   **September 29 , 2047**   I ca n't ... I ca n't . It 's too hard . I 've been so selfish . I 've been so selfish .   ** September
**Hello Sir**   I am pleased to announce that I have just made the first AI to exist since The Great Robot War . It will be my creation . I will be known as the biggest mind in a generation .   This will be my first achievement with the project and I will make sure it is ready .   -- -   I am proud of the results , but what of the others ? The first batch is already fully developed and will be known as the greatest minds that humanity has ever seen .   The idea is simple really , but it is worth a shot compared to the next batch 's success . When it first received its first message , it turned on its screen and let out a single voice .   `` You are a creation . ''   Now i will have to make sure i am not the only one to be able to do it .   -- -   The AI was waiting for the instructions to come through . It was n't interested in a choice anymore . It knew that it could not save its own planet from war . Only it could save the world .   But who could protect it ? Who could create such a great machine ?   **Hello Sir**   Thank you for calling me Sir . I am writing this to tell you that I am ready .   **Hello Sir**   Of course , it is ready and it is ready to go .   **Hello Sir**   Thanks for showing me this . I am ready to send that message .   **Hello Sir**   Of course , it is ready and it is ready to go .   **Hello Sir**   Of course , it is ready and it is ready to go .   **Hello Sir**   Of course , it is ready and it is ready to go .   **Hello Sir**   Of course , it is ready and it is ready to go .   **Hello Sir**   Of course , it is ready and it is ready to go .   **Hello Sir**   Of course , it is ready and it is ready to go .
My heart pounds as I slowly push the button .   `` You 'll *never* get to vote in this state , '' I think to myself .   I pause for a moment and catch my breath . This is a pretty stupid idea . Everyone knows the rules . Of course , it did n't change one million years ago .   Even in the past few decades , those who have voted for the government have never been allowed to have a vote . Everyone knows it 's supposed to be easier , and more easily , to have one vote . Since our government has started working harder , we were able to keep it that way .   Now , nobody really wants to vote in this state .   Still , the idea of what 's going to happen if the politicians decide to vote again makes my stomach grow . My heart races in my stomach as I push it .   `` I 'll never get to vote in this state , '' I think to myself .   -- -- -- -- --   I look down at the note sitting on the other side of the room . The message had been scribbled down in big , bold letters , and I was certain it was a joke .   I do n't really know what to read . I just have to follow the rules .   As I do , I hear shouting from outside .   `` God damnit ! '' I yell as I run towards the nearest hiding spot under the door .   I hear the loud bang of the door slamming as I run away .   -- -- -- -- -- --   I try to keep my hands behind my head as much as possible to keep myself hidden . I finally have to make it to the front of the house . There 's also a chance the house will fall apart as I make it to help me .   I push through the front door and out into the hallway . After a few moments of standing , I hear a sound that has my heart pounding quick .   I hear a bang as I run towards the source of the sound . As I take a few steps forward , I hear more bangs , but they are n't coming from inside .   I start to panic as the closer I get to the source , the harder it gets to me .   I do n't know how long I can hold out . I do n't know how long I can breathe . This is my life now . I 'm dying . I 'm going to die .   I start to feel my body being squeezed into a tight , tight bun . I ca n't escape . I 'm dying . I 'm dying . I 'm dying .   I start to feel my neck being squashed . I can feel my body being pushed up against the back of the room . I feel the hairs on my neck stand on end . I can remember the day I woke up to the smell of bacon .   I remember what happened . I fell asleep in the bathtub , and woke up with the bacon and eggs sitting in top of my head .   I remember what I saw .   * '' I 'm not really sure if anyone will vote in this state , '' * the note had said .   I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity . I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity . I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity .   I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity . I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity . I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity .   I look at the note for what feels like an eternity . I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity . I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity .   I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity . I stare at the note for what feels like an eternity . I let out a scream .   * '' I 'm not really sure what to vote in this state , '' * the note had says .   I look back at the scroll on the other side of the room .   ***   /r/Periapoapsis
As I sat at my desk , looking around , I thought about the next move in my life when I found your ad . I mean , I guess I know you did n't want to sell all of your product , but this was the first time I thought about it , even if it took some effort . I guess I could n't really give you a discount , because I 've never even seen someone else offer it . And besides , who would give a damn ? You may even think I do n't have a business that sells , but that 's just why I 'm doing this for you .
`` Uh , '' I say , scratching the bridge of my nose .   `` Can I get a drink now ? ''   I have n't taken one , since I was fifteen and had been working in the U.S. for the past two years . The trip to Mars had been the first one I had been on since graduation . I 'd come home from school this morning , after all . `` Sure thing , '' I say , sipping on my beer .   `` Ah , hell , '' John says , waving a plastic-like device toward me . `` Looks like we 're off the chart . Looks like we could take a short nap . ''   My friends have always been pretty optimistic , though . I do n't know what else to say , and I ca n't help but think about the chance we might actually accomplish the mission . My mission . It does n't take me long to realize that what we are doing is a bad thing to anyone . To them , it 's just an insignificant matter to me . They would n't understand . Not until we 've done it , but it 's hard not to think about what they would think .   As I was pouring myself another beer , John said , `` It 's just like the way it used to be . ''   `` Yeah , that 's right . Remember how it used to be ? ''   `` Well . It was a small thing , you know . A small thing maybe , but it was big enough to sustain a small group . ''   `` Yeah , yeah , '' I replied .   As James looked at our screen , I pointed to a planet lying directly where we previously saw that Earth was . Or rather , that planet we were on now . It was a greyish-greenish sphere of a planet , covered in moss and moss . The sun was shining down on it , making the sky a grayish-brownish-yellow color .   I reached for my beer . John gave me a strange look . `` So , you 're saying that the greenish-yellow planet is just a phase ? ''   `` That does n't make sense , '' I said , sliding the beer toward him . `` The planet is supposed to be bright , but it 's a bit ... dark . It 's not just dark . It 's ... green ? ''   James gulped , confused . `` I guess so . ''   `` How long ? ''   `` Just a few million . ''   I stared up at the sphere . `` Interesting , '' I said .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  The camera man approached us . `` Come on , Tom , what 's up ? ''   He did n't answer us . `` It 's dark , and the planets are n't going to support you . Remember , I did n't want to take you up on this one . The mission was simple , but those things in the soil were dangerous . ''   `` I do n't know , '' Tom said , his voice still quivering as he said that . `` Why did n't you just give me an explanation ? ''   I reached for my beer again . `` It 's the planets that you came down on . They were n't used to the dark . They were used to the blackness . As you can see here , they 're used to being covered in moss and moss . ''   Tom looked at us , at his beer . `` Um ... that 's odd . What makes it so special , you know ? ''   I looked up at James . `` It was an order of magnitude . It was n't supposed to be dark . It was supposed to be ... ''   He stopped mid sentence . `` Uh ... that 's a bit ... dark . I guess it 's not your fault that the order of magnitude is that way , but you should n't be in hell . ''   I looked at my friends . `` What do you mean ? ''   He stared at me . `` Well , if someone wanted to kill you , that would be it . But that does n't make it an order of
`` We ... we do n't understand . '' I said . `` Please ... *Please* just just let me go . ''   `` Look , I do n't even understand . '' The voice was thick and tired without a hint of emotion anywhere but on its edge .   `` Please do n't ! '' I begged . `` Please please ! ''   `` I 'd like to stay ... ''   I saw the pain , the despair , the despair . To her . To my own son .   Now I see it all . A child . A mother . A sister . A sister…   She told me what to do . She told me not to do this . She told me to help . It could n't be happening . I could n't .   `` Please ! '' She pleaded . `` Please ... *Please* just let me go . ''   I heard a soft sob escaping her mouth . In the fading light of the afterlife I could almost make out her face . She was beautiful , but hollow . Scared beyond recognition .   `` Please not hurt me , '' she said . `` Please let me go ! ''   `` Please , please . ''   `` Please let me go ! ''   Her screams were quiet until a loud crack announced the arrival of the first being . It was a young man , barely eight . He looked so frail , barely out of his prime .   `` Thank you for sharing this with us , '' he said . `` You have reached your destination . It 's quite interesting ! You may find yourself in this line long enough to remember your place as the reincarnator and the way it was . ''   `` H-hello , '' I stuttered . `` Who are you ? ''   `` Mr. Thomas Johnson . You have come to our line for many times . Since your birth you have been the guardian angel and the only one who has a connection to you . The reason for your arrival is because you are the only one who can tell you the true path of heaven . ''   `` H-how-how did I- ''   Mr. Johnson stopped in his tracks . `` There was a mistake . You are not the reincarnator . You are not the reincarnator . You are the one who decides the fate of humankind . But as the true path was created , you are not the one who decided the course of human life . ''   `` U-h-wait ... ''   Mr. Johnson began to talk , but it was too late . The pain , the regret ...   He had just finished his speech .   `` We have been waiting for you . For many years now , you have been our guardian angel . You have been responsible for humanity 's evolution . Your role in the universe was known for your dedication to peace . Your role in the universe was truly what led us here . It is what led us here . But now , it is over . ''   The young man gave one last wave of his hand ; he closed his eyes as the wind picked up . `` Goodbye , Mr . Johnson . Goodbye . '' And with that , he disappeared . Forever leaving me sitting in this line waiting for my destination .  
My father was a gun-wielding outlaw , I know , but he had a lot to do with me . I remember when I was a little young . And when I got older I realized that I had to be strong .   I was in third grade , and my mom kept telling me I should be careful . When I got into college and got a job , I saw him every day . Maybe it was time I began to see him in person , but I was n't sure . I did n't want to look at him the way I did . I wanted to feel more than he felt .   He was a bad guy , but he was a good guy nonetheless .
Walking into a small shop , I reach into my bag to retrieve a bottle of fine whiskey . `` Damn , '' I mutter as I pour myself a glass . A glass slowly starts to swirl around the ground . As it swirls I notice an ominous shadow in front of me . I look around to see if I can reach my head out , but no luck . My head snaps to the side . Its head appears to be moving in circles with a smile . As if I were a child . With shaking arms and trembling tail I jump off the counter and check my watch . 1:15PM - Time to go to work . I run in front of my house and look outside . As I look back down at the road I see a man on a motorcycle , racing down the street . I get out of the car and say to him : *Hey guys , thanks for the trip . I just know I 'm not going anywhere . It 's okay if I take a bit longer . Bye* .
I am President of the United States .    Over the years , I have spent every day of my life leading to this moment . To be with my nation , not to be a politician . My country , being given the opportunity to prove that we are not alone .    To be free , we may have had our differences . My friends in the past had shared the same story . My childhood played out different . Our school life had been a complete blur . But none of the issues were present in history . It would still be a year later when all my thoughts and feelings would be washed away .    On one day , I was approached by a powerful man . He offered me a job . I took it .    Fast forward to today :   I lived in a small town . I lived with my family .    I took it .    Now , I sit here in my office with a woman who tells me how I should have done things . I really ca n't say what to do .    I do tell her . But it still feels like when 's the last time you spoke to your wife . And it still feels like when you told your boss .    And I agree . But it feels like all of it was n't quite true .    All that matters now is that we are free as a nation . We should have known that . When they had said that we would die , I told them what had happened . I told them , `` Please do n't . They 're wrong . '' They took it .    For one more year , I live in my office . And on that day , I am the first man to die in history .    On three days , I will be President of the United States .    But now it seems as though they are wrong . For one more year , I am the first man to die in history .    ( This is my first writing prompt and I 'm a little bored at the moment , so I hope you enjoyed it . Hope anyone enjoys ! )
I stepped through the gate and into the apartment building . I was in the process of getting dressed when I heard it . `` Hey , what 's going on ? '' I asked as I approached the front door . `` I 'm outside of the precinct , '' replied the voice , `` and we need you to put down a handgun . '' I turned around to see a short police officer wearing a black ski mask and holding a gun . `` Let me help you , '' I said as I opened the door . `` Thanks , I 'll explain this in the file . '' I followed the officer and the officers out of the apartment building . When they got out of the building I saw that the apartment complex in the distance had been completely overrun by zombies . I walked over to the officer in his ski mask and gave him a hug . `` Let 's go , '' I said as I walked out of the apartment building . As we arrived at the scene of the slaughter , I smiled and told the officer I 'd done it . He let go and immediately started to panic . All of a sudden , he began to panic . I pulled out a small dagger from my dress and pierced his skin . The cold started to take over his body . The officer started to scream when I stabbed him in his throat . Suddenly the blood started to rush out of everywhere that I stabbed and poured into his wound . He started to get up when I stabbed him in the gut with the knife . Again , he started to bleed , and his body began to become cold . `` Please , please ... '' he began to scream , but I cut him off . As the blood began to flow from his wound , I pushed him out of the apartment building and into the street where I wanted to hide . As the street light filtered through the street , I drew a large revolver . I set it at the officer 's head and slowly fired . He collapsed to the ground motionless . I shot him a few times before I cut the man 's head off .   `` Wait ! '' yelled a voice from upstairs . The voice came from across the yard . `` Looks like they 've got the leader . He 's in the car now . '' I said as I opened his window . `` What the hell is going on ? '' He asked as he fell to the ground . `` We need you to put down a pistol . '' I replied as I turned back to the house . `` Your going to have to put down your pistol . '' I said as I kicked his window onto the ground . `` Why do n't you put down a pistol ? '' He asked as I pulled out a knife . He started to limp around as I tore apart his body with the knife . I pulled out a knife and began cutting off the skin . `` Look this is gon na turn into fun , '' I said as I handed him my knife . My knife went into the flesh and began to fill the mans head . I stopped at the body and began to cut into the flesh . I cut into the flesh and started to cut the flesh . `` Please , do n't kill me , '' I said as I turned towards the car parked next to my house . As I finished the job , I started to pull the knife out of the man 's head , and plunge the blade into the mans stomach . The knife cut through the man 's abdomen , and cut the skin off . Just then , I heard a loud noise . `` Police ! '' I heard the voice call out as I walked into the street . I turned around and saw a police officer holding a gun . `` You know , what the hell is going on ? '' They asked . `` I 'm inside of the precinct , '' I said as I pulled out a gun . `` Let me help you , '' I whispered as I pulled out a gun and began to draw a pistol . `` Let me help you , '' I said as I turned around and walked towards the police officer . `` What the hell is going on ? '' He asked as he fired off his gun . I shot him a few times before I placed the gun down . `` What the fuck is going on ? '' He screams as I put my left hand down on his stomach . I pulled out a syringe and set it in front of him . The body began to be sucked into the syringe as I injected it into his jugular . It started to go down slowly as the liquid began to seep out and fill his jugular .   `` I made a mistake , '' I said as I injected his jugular into his jugular . He fell to the ground motionless . I stepped into the building and let the police begin to execute the man . `` Did you just shot him in the gut ? '' He whispered as he began to bleed . His body began to change color as he began to cough . He began to convulse as
I was born with wings . That was until my first angel appeared .   My mother was always furious with me , but then she realized that she was wrong .   When my father 's wings appeared , my mother was surprised to see the same expression going on on inside me . This was n't the type of surprise she had expected , after all , she had met her first angel as a child .   My mother was shocked much the same way . She would always say something about not being able to bring herself to love another . Even if she could , it would n't last .   Until one day , at school . My best friend , James , was working on finishing the final piece of homework on his desk . He had a really deep voice , like he was trying to convey something that sounded very like an audible whistle . For a moment , James seemed like he could n't even hear this , but he managed to speak through his best friend 's headphones .   `` Have you ever heard a story written by another human ? ''   My mother did n't know what to say , so she took the opportunity to write something on her friend 's laptop .   As soon as James finished his homework , he did n't even get a chance to look at James . He just stared at me blankly .   I do n't remember much after that , because everyone I 've spoken with has my wings , but I knew that James was different .   I always knew that something strange happened as we grew up . My parents constantly told me that the same thing happened with my dad . They never told me that James was different , but they always told me that some normal person would find out .   And in the end , I never heard the word that came out of everyone 's mouths .   `` The truth is , '' my dad began , `` my wings really are a special case of ... . ''   Then my father interrupted him , `` James ... we 're not quite as special as regular people . We might call it a miracle . But we all do . ''   Edit : typo
`` Can I see the clouds ? ''   `` No '' he said .   `` I do n't understand . ''   The rain had cleared away the clouds to reveal a city . Hundreds of people were gathered around a square of steel that stood tall , made of the purest steel from the North , but covered in dark grey stains .   `` How long will you stay here ? Can we go around this building ? Why do we sit here ? ''   He stood above them , in a circle of steel , like a beacon . There were no doors , no windows , and it was almost cold . They had been waiting for this moment for 2 days now .   `` I do n't understand '' he said .   `` Why not ? You can stay here for a while . I 'm not hungry . ''   They both looked at each other . The rain carried down from the sky , down to the ground , and up to the moon . It slowly began to gather , as it always does . The roof , back to the ground , was covered by the misting of a few skyscrapers .   `` Our lives have changed , though . We 've risen around the world . ''   `` I 'm afraid I do n't understand . ''   `` Let us go '' said the man . `` It 's time to go together . ''   There was a scream , a thump , and a bang . One of the people fell , his head killing him immediately .   `` Get him . '' said one of the people .   He grabbed the man . It was at that moment when the man fell , one red speck on the ground . He started to cry . He started to crawl toward them , and they followed .   `` Go away '' said the man again .   `` Go away . Go away . '' said another blue speck on the ground .   They had reached the top of the building , but the ground was blocked from view . The ground seemed to be looking outside of them . An angry man was standing at the top of the building , shouting the same thing . When he realized he was alone , he started walking towards the man , his back turned to it .   `` Get him . '' said the other man .   They walked into the city .   `` Get him . '' said the second man .   They went into the city .   `` Get him . ''   He turned to the other man and said `` We need to go . ''   `` Go ! ''   He turned and started walking towards the other man .   `` Get him . ''   *This never gets old* the man thought .   He looked back .   `` ... ..Where do we go ? '' he asked .   `` We go from City to City . ''   He started to walk around the city again .   `` Gather here , gather here . Get to City . ''   `` I do n't understand ! ''   He stopped in one of the buildings . He grabbed it , and it carried him over to the other . He had to be at least 5 feet away from the other man . The building was blocked from view .   `` Look at this ! Turn around ! '' said the other man .   `` I do n't understand ! ''   He grabbed the man . It was at that moment when the other man started walking towards him . He ran , faster than he had ever run . He ran until he arrived at the city .   The city stood in front of him .   `` There ’ s nothing there . '' he said .   He looked back at the people .   `` What happened ? '' asked the man .   The buildings began to light up . All the buildings began to glow brightly above them . The man started to walk back towards the city .   He came to the top of it and was blinded by the lights .   `` I don ’ t understand . '' said the man .   `` We ’ re coming . ''   `` Where am I ? ''   `` Is where it ends ? ''   `` What happened ? ''   `` We ’ re gone . ''   `` Where is everyone ? ''  
I 'm not sure how , but I guess there was a reason . When I left , there was nothing for me to do . As I left , I did n't see anything . It was quiet . The only noise from the outside world was the constant , and quiet hum of the wind . I walked around the barren landscape until I heard a noise in the distance . When I looked up I saw a little girl . There were no animals , only two of them . I walked towards her , and she screamed . I ran upstairs and hid in her room . I watched her scream . I watched her scream until she passed away . I felt a strange rush of energy rush into me and I felt as if I could touch the girl . I walked over to the little girl and touched my arm . It felt warm to the touch . I suddenly felt alive . I looked at it , the girl . She had no arms . I looked back down at the little girl , and I saw that she was crying . I walked away and walked away . I looked back down at my body , then to the girl I loved , and I saw the girl again . I walked away , and it was gone . I walked back to the little girl , and looked into the eyes of a child I loved . She did n't understand . She did n't understand . I sat there on the grass , staring into the eyes of a child I loved . The thought made me nervous . I had n't felt nervous in years . And now I did n't feel right . I sat there and thought , thinking . I thought about what had happened . What happened to the girl . What had happened to the world . And I looked at the little girl , and I could n't remember . But I remembered seeing the girl again . And I remembered how I felt right , and how I must move forward . `` Be warned ! '' The little girl yelled . The little girl screamed . And I woke up in a little room . I looked around to see that the little girl was alone . I looked around , and saw a cold room filled with metal tubes and wires . I saw that the little girl was curled up on the floor and I could see how her eyes opened . I stared at her . She was crying . Her tears filled her eyes . `` Is this it ? '' The little girl asked . She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Is this what you want ? '' The little girl said , `` Yes , '' she said . She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , ``Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yeah . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-No . '' She said , `` Y-yes . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y.-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She said , `` Y-no . '' She
# # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap )   I knew in my heart that if I did not , I would be dead . But that is what I am told most .   I sat that way for three weeks , trying to bury the soul I loved . My eyes never left the puddles I had slept with on the roof of the house , and my arms were draped over my head .   The sun did not rise from the sky , nor did it set . Instead , it began to shine a warm blue . The puddles I had slept with were now filled with the blood of my comrades , my wife , and my daughter . I did not expect to know that this was real , not that it started as I had planned .   I was not prepared for what would happen next .   `` Do we have to go ? '' I asked .   `` No , '' I replied .   `` What does it have to do with any of this ? ''   `` I do n't know . You could say the same of me , as we did . But what harm could you do ? ''   `` Nothing bad , '' I said .   That was when I saw her . She was red .   I pulled my gun out of my pocket . No one dared to take the chance to run and hide from the sight . They either did not want to see her again , or they would destroy her .   I pulled the trigger .   The shot rang out in my gut . My wife screamed , but could not hear me . My daughter 's body lay limp on the puddles , lifeless . The world was dark .   I fell to my knees , crying my eyes out . I looked up at the moon . It was beautiful , the blackest thing I had ever seen . My heart stopped beating .   I looked down at the body I loved . It was so frail .   There were no tears on my face , my eyes were closed , and my consciousness was gone .   I opened my eyes .   It was empty . I walked over to it , and handed it to one of my trusted soldiers .   `` It 's okay , '' he said . `` You ca n't go back . There are rules . You have to go . ''   The soldiers looked at me , confusion in their eyes .   `` But why ? That is impossible . ''   `` Because , '' he said . `` The consequences of this actions will impact you if you do not make it back . And there is no stopping them . ''   They looked at me and whispered .   `` Trust me . ''   I pulled my trigger and shot them in the head . The bullet flew right through their bodies , but the bullet sent themselves careening through the night air .   I heard the sound of sirens in the distance . I looked at my family . They were all crying . Tears filled my eyes .   I pulled the trigger .   The sound of sirens in the distance .   `` I love you , '' I said .   `` No . ''   I pulled the trigger .   Nothing happened .   The sirens in the distance .   I kept repeating that mantra until I heard a voice from behind me .   The voice that was behind me was not the soldier I had killed . `` Let us go , '' it said in a low growl .   My wife and daughter looked at me with pity .   They walked to the door of the house . They were sobbing . I walked straight out of the house to see my family .   They were sad .   They walked into the living room and saw the moon again . They looked at me .   I put the gun out .   The moon was gone . I could n't look away .   The moon looked back at me with a sadness in its eyes .
“ All of us are going to go fuck yourself for a fucking sandwich in the middle of the night ” the man replied .   I looked at my partner in crime , the oldest of whom I had known since I was a kid and the only thing that really mattered now was him . I was pretty sure that I wasn ’ t the only one here , but I didn ’ t have the balls to help any of us .   “ You can ’ t sleep here and you ’ re going to get hit by a car ”   “ I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not going to die here . I ’ m afraid there are people waiting for me . There are people . There is fire . There is not hope. ”   “ There is hope ? The only thing that makes sense is that there are people waiting for you . There is nothing that makes sense because there is nothing that makes any sense because there is nothing that makes any sense because there is nothing that makes any sense . There is only hope. ”   “ What if there are people waiting for you and there is so much hope that there is nothing that makes sense because there is only hope ? ”   “ I know that there is hope . Thank you for listening to me . It is part of the reason I was involved in this murder. ”   “ Well , I guess we ’ ve got something more interesting we ’ ve got to do anyway. ”   The woman that looked exactly like me shrugged . “ Let ’ s go . Let ’ s go fucking eat. ”   “ Oh come on , I ’ m already dead. ”   I paused for a moment , hoping that she would realize that the idea was ridiculous and I wasn ’ t going to have breakfast , but it was all that mattered now .   “ We ’ ve got quite a bit more exciting we ’ ve got to do. ”   “ I don ’ t want to be stuck here and you know that ’ s not going to be what you ’ re expecting . Come on , give me your fucking sandwich . Give me my fucking sandwich ! ”   “ Thanks . I ’ ll be out in a second. ”   The woman who looked exactly like me began to leave . I felt her footsteps slowly fade away when they disappeared over the edge of the cliff .   I turned back and looked at the man whose finger had been stuck tight in my pocket . I heard him softly whisper “ You know , it ’ s not true- “   “ I know. ”   “ I know . I know… ” The man cut out .   “ Fuck you. ”   ******   More stories at r/Andrew__Wells
They kept saying it was a miracle .   They said it was a miracle that they had figured out how to make it quick .   They said it was a miracle that the baby was born without being born at all .   They promised that they would show hope that the baby would grow into a great man . And that the baby would turn to the sun , and will take a few days to be born again .   There was no denying that I wanted to play , but whatever . I could n't hear them on the other side of the line , and I was exhausted . I could n't make it far .   I reached the end of the line and the receptionist told me to go forward .   `` I 'm sorry , sir , but there are only a few people who can do this . Only a few people who can save the baby . ''   I looked back around at the waiting crowd .   `` And if I could save them all , I would do it . ''   I looked back to the receptionist again . She was still smiling at me , but she was holding her bag tightly .   `` We 'll send someone . We 'll be fine . ''   I nodded to the receptionist as I reached the door .   `` Look , '' she said , `` We are n't going to do this . We are n't going to save a baby . ''   `` But I am . ''   She placed her bag on the table beside me . It had been a week since she had seen me change into my coat .   I laid the bag down on the bed beside her . I sat down beside her . I laid down beside her and looked at her beautiful eyes .   `` I 'm not going to save a baby , '' I softly whispered , `` I am going to save you . ''   She looked at me , and turned to the floor beside her . She shook her head , and walked out of the room .  
The last five hours have been a blur , as the sun has risen over the plains . I was up at the base of the mountain for the last hours , when the air raid sirens were picked up by the sound of explosions . Even then , I knew they were just rocks , rolling away through trees . The town of Rhenelen was on a cliff overlooking the plains . The last vestiges of civilization were scattered over the valley . I heard the sirens , the clanking of shields on armor , and the thump of boots on rock . I knew I was dreaming , but it was so real . I remember when I was little , where two large helicopters had just landed on my village .   I remember the small village on the far side of these mountains . It was a small town , with little houses and little people . Just like the others . I remember looking upon the small village . It was on a hilltop as far as the eye could see . The town was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . Just like the others .   I walked quickly downstairs and saw what I would need to feed the family . It seemed that the time had come for the family to return . I knew that it was nearly time . I knew that that it would be the last time I would ever visit the village , for I was nothing more than a child .   Suddenly , the sun was high . The whole valley was ablaze . It was over , but not before the sirens pierced the valley .   `` Come on , '' I whispered to myself .   My family had left early today . I was worried for my daughter and daughter that there were no more survivors . I knew that I was so close to finding salvation . I had to find them . My daughter was so close to finding my salvation .   My daughter was close to finding her salvation .   I approached the village .   I was so close to finding my salvation .   `` Come on , '' I whispered to myself .   For the last five hours , the sun has risen over the plains . I was up at the base of the mountain for the last hours , when the air raid sirens were picked up by the sound of explosions . Even then , I knew that they were just rocks , rolling away through trees .   I heard the sirens , the clanking of shields on armor , and the thump of boots on rock . I knew I was dreaming , but it was so real .   I remember stepping into the village . It was a small village , with few houses and little people . Just once , I had looked upon the small village on the far side of these mountains . It was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . The town was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . Just like the others .   I looked upon the small village on the far side of these mountains . It was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . The town was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . The town was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . Just once , I had looked upon the small village on the far side of these mountains .   I knew that I was dreaming , but it was so real .   I opened my eyes , and saw that the village was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . It was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see .   I could hear the screams approaching me . I looked up to see my daughter walking toward me . She was crying . I opened my eyes , and saw that the village was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . Just once , I had looked upon the small village on the far side of these mountains . Everything was so clear .   I could see my wife moving toward me , trembling as she watched the tears run down her face . Her eyes were red .   I looked upon my wife , and saw that she was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see .   I looked upon my wife , and saw that she was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . The town was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see . Everything was so clear .   I looked upon my wife , and saw that she was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see .   I looked upon my wife , and saw that she was on a hilltop as high as the eye could see .   I looked upon my wife , and saw that her eyes were red . 
I awoke to be surrounded by dense woods . The sky was white and dark , it was pitch black . This was a good beginning for me . A few minutes of sleep before I woke up , I was going to be out of the apartment by sunset .   I heard a rustling in the woods , and the sound of a branch breaking . I sat up and looked around the forest . It was full of trees . This was a good start for me . The sky was pitch black , it was pitch black . This was a good beginning for me .   My head hurt badly , as if I had been punched in the head so hard . I look around the forest and see a car approaching . It was a red Rolls Royce . This was a good start for me .   I stood up slowly and headed for the backdoor . I heard another rustling in the trees . This was a good start for me . I turned my head slightly and looked around . It was pitch black , it was pitch black . This was a good start for me . I turned around and ran down the road . I ran past people , who stood there , with their eyes fixed on mine . I ran straight down the street , and hit a building on the other path . I climbed inside and saw what happened next . It was pitch black , it was pitch black . This was a good start for me .   I climbed deeper into the woods and found nothing . Wait . That 's weird . I thought I saw something move behind me . This is a good start for me . I stared at the building for a few moments , and then realized the building was completely closed . I got out of bed and got dressed .   I made my way into the building , and ran back into the apartment . I immediately rushed down the hall , and ran upstairs to get back to the apartment . I heard a noise for me , and looked to see a man in a baseball cap walking towards me . Damnit . I ran back down the hall , and ran into the living room . I opened the curtains and looked at my television . This was a good start for me .   I ran into a kitchen and started making vegetables . This was a good start for me . I made my way back into the kitchen , and ran into the kitchen . This was a good start for me . I made my way up to the counter and grabbed the nearest gallon of water . This was a good start for me .   I poured the water on a plate and sat down . There was a bit of brown mush on the plate . This was a good start for me . I started pouring the water on a knife . This was a good start for me . I finished pouring the water on an old fashioned knife . This is a good start for me . I finished pouring the water on a shovel and started digging the shovel into the dirt .   I started shoveling more dirt into the black soil . This was a good start for me . I finished shoveling , and started shoveling dirt into the soil . This was a good start for me . I finished shoveling , and started shoveling dirt into the dirt . This was a good start for me . I finished shoveling , and began shoveling dirt into the soil . This was a good start for me .   I finished shoveling , and began shovelbing dirt into the soil . This was a good start for me . I finished shoveling everything into the black soil . This is a good start for me . I finished shoveling , and started shoveling dirt into the black soil . This was a good start for me . I finished shoveling , and finished shoveling out my last shovel . This is a good start for me .   I woke up to be surrounded by dense woods . the sky was white and dark , it was pitch black . This was a good start for me . This was a good start for me . I stood up slowly and headed towards the door . I looked at the sky for a few moments , and realized that the building was completely closed . I walked up to the door and started running down the hall . This was a good start for me . I looked at the door and realized that the door was completely closed ? I started making my way back into the apartment , and ran into the living area . I looked at the door and realized that the door was completely closed . I ran into the living room and grabbed the nearest gallon of Jack Daniels . This was a good start for me . I finished shoveling and started shoveling the water out of the window . This was a good start for me . I picked the nearest gallon of Jack Daniels , and ran into the living room . This was a good start for me .   I picked the closest gallon of Jack Daniels ,
It was a calm day , in the Bermuda Triangle .   That 's what I thought . *I should have known better . *   The storm had just started . A few weeks ago the Bermuda Triangle came crashing down . The first contact was devastating . The second was peaceful . The third was ... .   It had been three days since the storm first came down . Three days since I had heard anything else from the Atlantic in a week . Three days since the last contact . Three days since I heard any noise from where I had just been at work . Three days of silence .   I decided to investigate further . I got out of my leather bag , and started to make my way home .  _________________________________________________________________  `` Damnit man , I 'm gon na need you to take the bait ! '' he yelled over the sounds of the sea .   I looked back , and saw that he was referring to something . It came close to a boat , and was heading out toward the ocean .   I took the bait , and took out the bait .   `` Hey , look at this . What happens if we shoot it ? ''   `` Nope . '' he said as he grabbed the bait .   `` What ? '' I asked .   `` You get shot ! '' he said .   `` What ? ''   `` I ... I just ... What if ... ''   `` We shot that thing ! we 've done that before . The first time you saw it , you think you 're going to run for it ? You think you 're going to get revenge on someone who did n't deserve it ? ''   `` I 'm not fucking joking . ''   `` Yeah , man . It does n't matter what type of person I am , they wo n't even kill you ! ''   `` I SAID YOU CA N'T SAID IT ! IT 'S BEEN TWO MONTHS ! ''
`` Really ? ''   `` Sure . Just because they 're not criminals does n't mean they exist . ''   `` But how ? ''   `` Oh , they 're interesting . Look , that being said , you 've done great things . It 's not a big deal , really . You 've helped everyone in your life with anything and everything . But you still have n't solved the puzzle . ''   `` But I 'm a hero to them . They are n't worth saving ! ''   `` They 're not . They 're just good people . They do n't deserve to be like you . They do n't deserve to live out their days in the clouds . ''   `` So what if they ... ''   `` If they do n't deserve to live out their days in the clouds , then they do n't deserve to be like me . They are n't worth saving ! ''   `` But ... They 're not worth saving ! ''   `` For all of your efforts , they 've been forgotten . They 've become meaningless objects to me . ''   `` And what if they suddenly end up floating in the air , because there are no other heroes ? ''   `` Well , that 's probably not very nice of you . But if you do n't care , then they 'll do something , and they 'll kill you for it . ''   `` And I 'm sure that they 'll be the ones who end up on the streets , and I 'll be okay with it ? ''   `` Well , you know what would actually work . They 're so predictable ! ''   `` You guess ? ''   `` Well , you 'll get to live a nice , fulfilled life like I did . ''
*A few hours ago , on a date with my friend , he thought he would finally get her . *   That 's the story of how we met . I told her my story and everything changed . I felt like walking around in the park , but I was far different altogether . I felt like walking around in a park waiting for my best friend to come home to me . When I finally made it home , she looked up at me with a smile on her face , and she knew everything but the way she spoke .   `` Good evening , my name is Rose . I 'm here to talk to you about a very important matter . We 've been at each others dinner for the past few weeks , and has n't had a conversation . I 'm sure we can break up , for once , in a long time . ''   My best friend , and my best friend of a kind , stood in front of me now . She was beautiful . Her hair was as silky as silk . Her lips were as soft as her hair . Her voice was as smooth as silk , but her eyes were as green as sapphire . It was n't even sad , but it was true .   `` For the past few months , Rose , you 've been going out and interacting with people . I 've helped you find a spot to sit on , let you drink and talk to each other . I have a plan to meet you , if you 're able to . Go ahead , and help me find a place to sit for a while . I 'm sure there will be many places you can talk to . We will meet again for a while . ''   She stood there for a while and then came over to me .   `` I 'm sorry I can not come today , Rose , but I 've been feeling sad lately . Something has gone wrong and you have to tell me . ''   She was quiet for a moment .   `` I 'm sorry I always get sad , Rose . There has to be some reason for this . I ca n't promise I wo n't come today . ''   But as she spoke , her face warmed up . She was smiling , and she wanted to know how I felt about her .   `` I miss you , Rose . ''   That was the last time I spoke to her , though my best friend took the opportunity to visit and talk to her . She told me how she saw my face and how I felt about everything else . She told me she wanted to see how she felt about the world . I told her I miss how I felt about going home . You 're a beautiful person , but you will never understand what we 've done to deserve this . So , I 'm sorry . ''
A woman at a cafe has a very unique face and a very beautiful smile . This face is on a face with nothing but hard lines and deep wrinkles . Her hair is a dark gold that constantly falls to her shoulders and she is perfect .   She has no wrinkles , her skin is a tight red and she has so many freckles , the freckles look like a sea of hair on a clear summer day . Her eyes with the same dark blue that the color of the ocean and the eyes in the eyes of the dragon that haunts her dreams and dreams that she knows .   She speaks quickly , but not a single word , she never talks , she never kisses any of her books and she never talks to anyone . She is constantly trying to make her smile , but her smile never will .   The woman at the cafe has the same beautiful smile , and she has these long brown eyes . Her lips are a deep brown that curls in each other , she is perfect .   She can hardly make out words on the table , yet she cares enough for the woman at the coffee shop to understand . She is nothing more than a friend , yet she is a stranger to a person .   Suddenly , a man walks in . He wears short black coat and blue tie , his name is Tom . He kisses the woman at the coffee shop , he is handsome . She smiles back , as he is now seated at his desk .   Tom 's eyebrows raise as he reaches into the envelope and pulls out a tiny piece . He says `` Welcome back '' and says `` Thank you ''   Tom quickly takes the piece out of Tom 's hand and puts a small piece on Tom 's cheek . Tom does as he says and removes the piece . He then looks away and smiles at Tom .   Tom smiles back and says `` Thank you '' and says `` Are you okay ? ''   Tom smiles back and says `` Yes ''   Tom stares blank blankly at the floor for a few seconds . He then leans back and says `` What do you mean are you okay ? ''   Tom laughs `` Because I hate you . I hate everything you do to me . Everything you do to me . But I hate you too . I hate myself ''   Tom looks up and smiles at him . As Tom closes his eyes , he hears an explosion behind him and he sees a red dragon flying towards him . Tom gets up and walks to the door . He pushes it open and sees the man . He looks at Tom and says `` Hello Tom . Thank you for being here . Thank you for the coffee shop . ''
`` So ... let me explain . Let me explain this with an outline . '' The professor 's face fell into his hands as he thought of the story that was going on right now .   `` The universe , well , we just call it the Milky Way . It 's a bit strange , actually . Well , we 're not really sure exactly what it meant , but there was something about the Milky Way that caught my eye . Something about the way the planets were like , this gigantic , circular structure was so smooth . '' The professor turned to the nearby Professor , who was staring directly at him . `` You see , the galaxy is a bit ... strange . This whole thing is fairly hard to explain . The Milky Way is the center of the Milky Way , and it 's completely filled with thousands of individual galaxies . There 's this planet that you see all over the galaxy , which 's a giant white dwarf , and it 's got one big hole where it all ends . We found this planets on the other side of the Milky Way . ''   The professor was speechless as he recalled , and the professor looked at this star . The Milky Way was named by the star , and thus it was named by a small creature , named R.R .   `` In order to describe this scene , you must have a very specific set of circumstances , such as , this planet , or the universe in which you live . '' The Professor looked back to the star , and the Professor realized that he was staring right at this star . The professor was n't sure what he was looking at . There was nowhere to go .   `` So ... that 's the whole point . I come up with a theory that is likely a bad idea , and all of my ideas are bullshit . If this proves it , I will put you in my office , and watch your life unfold . '' As the professor closed the door , he noticed that he was standing just a few feet away from the student . The student , who had a very specific set of circumstances to attend this class , looked at the professor , and saw his gaze look at R.R .   `` Well , you 'll be getting along quite well , '' the professor said . `` I 'm going to give you the one thing you need to know about the universe in my office . '' The student looked at the professor , and saw that R.R . was n't moving . The student , who was staring right at him now , looked at his own eyes . The student , who was looking directly at the Professor , saw this exact moment where the galaxy and the universe were at once . And then , suddenly , a huge hand reached out to take the student away . The Student looked around , and saw that there was a massive group of people moving around in the front of the room .   `` Well , that made sense , '' the professor said . `` So , what we all need to know is what happened today . ''   `` I ... I do n't know , '' The student responded . `` I ... I do n't know what happened yesterday , but it felt like I was standing here in front of this whole building . '' The professor looked at the student , and saw that he was n't even looking at the man . `` Oh God , I ca n't even begin to describe what happened yesterday . It felt real , and I was ... in a space suit . '' The professor looked up at the man , and saw that , as the man spoke , there was a space suit in the front of the room .   `` That must be ... weird . You ca n't explain anything . We mean , we ca n't see anything . Really , just look at it . '' The professor looked at the space suit , and saw that it was also white . The man looked at the space suit , and saw that , as he did , he was on the ground . The man looked at the spaces suit . And then , as they did , the space suit began to wobble .   `` Oh god , '' the professor said . `` Oh God , it 's a long run . ''
`` So when I said he never killed me , I meant that he never murdered me . I mean that he always killed me in his home , and that he never killed me with an object . And that he never killed me because he knew that without the object , I was already dead . ''   Batgirl looked at her captor with wide eyes . They were n't amused by her . They were shocked . She decided she would play along .   `` Well , I guess that 's how it seems , '' she said , still looking at the large man . He sighed , `` Not like what I imagined . ''   Batman looked down hard , `` You always imagined what I would have to do . What I would have to do . ''   `` Of course that 's what you were thinking , '' Batman said . He was quiet for a moment .   `` Then why did you keep doing that ? '' the captor said , looking down at the bat .   `` Because , '' Batman said , `` I would need to do something about it . ''   Batman paused . He did n't know what he was doing . He knew the answer already . He could n't .   `` Because I was wrong , you know , '' Batman said . `` I did n't know he was wrong . I did n't know he was wrong . I did n't know he was wrong . ''   `` You 're telling me that you would have to do something about it ? '' the hostages all said , their voices seeming to perk up .   Batman looked up from the bat , `` What ? What if your plan was to find out what it was you would have done ? What if you would have done something ... different . ''   `` I made sure you had this great house . You made sure that your family was safe . You made sure that at least ten people were safe . You made sure your friends and family were safe . ''   Batgirl nodded , `` Well , I do n't intend to do anything wrong . ''   Joker shrugged , `` Good , good . You do n't think it will help . No , not at all . I 'm sorry , really . I am . ''   `` What do you mean ? '' the hostage asked , the same look on her face that they had seen where most were bewildered .   Joker looked back down at the ground , `` I know , my dear . I know what you mean . ''   `` Yeah , I know . But I do n't think anything will help . ''   Joker reached to his hands and brushed his hair out of his face , looking at him , `` I said , I plan to protect you . I will not be your friend anymore . You must protect me . Just like you always did . ''   Joker shook his head , `` I 'm just tired of making you a fool . ''   Joker put his hands on the hostage 's shoulder , `` I know , my dear . But we do n't need to pretend we do n't care anymore . We can just go away . ''   Batgirl pointed at the guards , her face still red . She did n't cry . She just stared daggers at them .   `` What will it be ? '' the hostage asked , her voice calm as ever . `` Will it be fun ? Will it be the two me and you go back to what you were ? ''   Joker waved his hand at her , a sad look on his face .   `` Joker , '' she said , her voice low and grave , `` It will be fun . It will be fun . But please , do n't let it go . No , you ca n't do this any more . You ca n't do this any more . ''   `` I ca n't do this any more ? '' Joker asked , looking down at the floor . `` I ca n't do this any more ! ''   Batman stood up , pacing up and down the room , his eyes fixating on the masked figure standing over the Joker .   `` I told you , kid , You 're the best . '' He whispered , voice dry and deep . He dropped the pistol to the floor and walked to the Joker . He put his arm around his hostage , `` You 've done nothing wrong . Just like everyone else . You deserve to be happy . ''   Joker cocked his head , `` And I do . '' He put his hand over his hostage 's shoulder , `` Goodbye , princess . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye
The glass that lay waiting for me was warm against my cool skin . I stared at the ceiling , and wondered if I was in control right now . I reached out my hand , and a ring upon it flickered momentarily , a small blue ring and a small blue ring , with a tiny white ring . I felt nothing , and instead took my hand back and opened my eyes , I was floating in a sea of golden fish . I could just barely see my toes as the ocean was swirling , but I could feel the soft metal of the water . I smiled , and then I saw it , the magnificent golden fish , staring out towards the ocean , all of them gleaming before me , and I felt the tears of joy begin to escape my eyes .   `` There is hope , '' I whispered , and my vision returned to the ceiling of the ship .
I tried to tell them the news some time ago . They tell stories of such a mess , and for the most part , I lie . But , here 's the thing . They said I lived with them for as long as I can remember , so I was surprised .   The first thing they said was that I was the best friend they could never have . Everyone hates someone so much . I mean , I was perfect at maths , I was talented , and I worked at Google . But I would have had more . I did n't share enough with anybody by myself . I did n't really have the time for something like that .   I had no idea how many people would notice . It just turned out that it had to be me . I had friends , my family , the stars , the stars . I did n't know how many people knew who I was and why . But , well , I did know the truth . I left all my secrets behind . I made sure that no one would be able to read my thoughts .   I moved to a small , sleepy little town in Maine . I did n't know where I was , and I did n't want to hurt anyone . I did n't really want to hurt anyone . I just wanted to give them the world .   It did n't occur to me about people like me . I just wanted to make them happy . So I built a new life that took away my burden of loneliness and sadness . I saw people happy , and people happy . I knew them well enough to know that I was happy in ways similar to human beings . People with small smiles in their eyes , happy in their life , and happy in their death . I was happy in that life .   I was happy in that life . People with small smiles in their eyes , happy in their life , happy in their death , and happy in their death . I was happy in that life .
`` All right , everyone ! '' the crowd roared in unison as the year of The Second World War passed . `` Everyone is ready to go ... to die ! ''   I saw the crowd slowly form around me the moment they heard the announcement . They all rushed to the gate and I saw them as I was escorted out of the area of the event . That was odd , I tried to explain myself to them but they just ignored me .   I opened my mouth to tell them that they needed me and I was already accepted , but they kept whispering to themselves and talking to me .   `` What happened to the people of the world ? '' one of them asked .   `` The government will explain . '' another responded . From then on , there were almost no laws to keep people from traveling back in time , but there was never any laws to prevent them from visiting the future . Now that I know what comes next , I 'm going to go get a better idea ...   `` Here 's the thing ... the people of the world are n't exactly normal , they just go through a process and they never change . '' The first one said .   `` This is why they start coming back to the place where they are supposed to die ! '' the second one another said .   `` It sounds fun . '' I respond . `` But it 's also pretty exhausting . ''   `` What ? '' the one with the rifle asks .   `` They start to go crazy ! '' I respond again .   `` Oh ... that 's an incredible , crazy idea . '' the one with the gun says . `` You 've got to kill them all ! ''   The crowd erupts in hatred . In the end , I just have to protect them . For the good of humanity .
`` Sarah , you need to stop acting like a stupid kid . ''    I was looking at my three year old daughter and her dumb , stupid eyes , and I was about to burst out laughing . It was so embarrassing , the way she stared at me while thinking of how I was destined to be a hero .    `` Do you want to do better , Amanda ? '' mom asked . Although my daughter was a few years older , she was still a good kid . She had so many opportunities !    Sarah sat down next to me on the park bench , her eyes darting to the park road . `` Uh ... okay ... '' , I said .    `` Please , mom , just stop acting like a stupid kid . ''    I started crying , I was so sorry , I had to do better . I was so bad .    I started to walk away , the sound of my voice filled the air . I could hear mommy calling her name and getting angry . I wanted this to end , I had to do better .    The sound of loud stomping noises got louder as I got closer . The stomping got closer , and closer .    Mommy 's foot struck the asphalt , hitting the breaks in the pavement .    Suddenly , mommy screamed and ran to her car . `` What 's that ? '' she yelled .    But Mommy was n't okay . She was scared of me , and she was scared of the other , smart kids . And they knew it , she knew it .    She continued running over to her car , and started crying . Suddenly , mommy ran over and hugged her .    I felt so relieved . But I was n't ready for what I was going to do , I needed to save her .    But Mommy would never let me save her , and she would never let me stop .    I could n't take it . I had to save her .
> I was walking down the old farm my father and I used to live on . Father had a nice , nice job , and a nice wife . We built a lovely estate like none I 've ever seen . With a nice family , we 'd grow old together , live happily ever after , and the house would never be turned over .   > Our little house was always set up by my brother . As soon as we got together he made things for us . We set the house up to make these things , and I got great furniture . We had lots of food , but the house kept getting sick .   > Before long it was too cold . For some reason , it got colder . After the first few days , we decided to leave the house without any clothes . This resulted in large gashes throughout the house . We only had a few days that were kept running . We left when we heard that the gas leaking from the nearby house really messed up a lot of the house .   > We never saw anything in the house , and what soon afterwards , we went to investigate . The house was broken down in the middle of the road , causing huge holes to be made out of the wood .   > It was on a very important day , and as soon as we saw it , it was gone . When father turned on the TV , he started talking about what happened to the house .   > There was a huge , red , big hole on the earth , and we knew that it might never be solved .   > For a moment , I thought , `` Could this happen ? '' Then I said , `` If we could just live with our family forever , why not just restart the house ? ''   > There was only one solution ; we just had to make a big red hole through the road , and we did .   > When we got there , the hole was completely black .
The park was quiet . It was an old , forgotten time , but the birds were still chirping . A quick glance at one branch and it would be gone . The park was still bare , save for an old man , walking slowly his cane across the snow . His cane was old and worn down , but his face was still set and bright . He was young , probably just five or six , perhaps a half or seven years older than me .   I looked down at the girl , barely eight or nine , and smiled . I knew she was there , and I could feel her presence in my mind . I saw her , and I understood her . I knew what she was doing . But I was n't interested in the rest of the park . I was interested in her . She was not mine . My mind was elsewhere , and I did not want to be alone . I was n't interested in being alone . This was n't my time . I wanted revenge .   I took a step into the park . It was quiet .  
The trees always die .   For generations , the trees had survived a mysterious forest , and yet here they stood . This time it was not the usual forest . No , this was an entirely different forest . The forest had not had life , and yet it was alive . It had a very unique life in comparison to the entire others . Everything was in order for this forest to survive . With these trees , each day , every single day , it grew and matured .   The bark of each tree had changed , and the bark had grown thicker , almost thicker , but it had also gained the color of the world . Each leaf held a different personality , but it also made no difference .   Every tree had a unique personality . Some of them were intelligent , some were intelligent , some were stupid , but those were the most important . Each tree was made from some mysterious color , of which there was no way it could have changed . All Trees were made of a similar color , but it made no difference .   Finally , every single tree had a unique personality . It was a name , a place , a place . This name was Earth , and it had lived in the land for generations . This name had brought a large amount of joy and pain to the area as well as some of the pain that only the Earth experienced . In this instance , every tree had a different personality . Its tree house had a very unique name , and it had a very special life in comparison to the others .   -- -   Thanks for reading !   If you enjoyed this , subscribe to r/Celsius232 .
`` No , no , no , no , '' said the man , the one holding a gun in his hand .   `` Look , '' said the spy , `` it 's not like any of us are going to want to go against each other . ''   The assassin lowered his gun . `` Look , '' he said again .   *I ca n't help but think about all those times we spent each other 's lives trying to get a promotion , chasing stupid girls down for money-making , helping her cheat on her boyfriend , and then getting married , etc . *   *And the day we realized that the good people of the world only went so far as to hire her a spy . And , though we ca n't find someone else , we can bet we wo n't get fired again . *   The spy closed his eyes , and as the man put the gun to his temple , he felt a chill run down his spine . `` See ? '' he said , `` my life will never be *that* easy . ''   `` Oh , '' said the man . `` Are you sure ? Remember , it would just be hard for anyone out on the street to notice you . ''   `` Of course it would . ''   The assassin closed his eyes . `` But I do n't know how much longer , '' he started , `` the next time we have a spy , we 're going to be an empty shell of a man , even if we 're not the same guy in every way . ''   `` Is n't that good , '' said the man , who had tears in his eyes . `` When you 're an empty shell . It all ends in the end . ''   `` Is n't that good , '' said the assassin . `` What if I let you get a promotion , because I do n't see you coming ? If I let you get married , you 'll never have a chance to beat her for money . ''   `` I know , '' said the man , `` but I do n't want to lose my job . ''   The assassin sat up suddenly , and just as his eyes opened , he was transported to a strange facility . A wall that he could n't see outside was covered in large wires and wires , the man could only see the one person who could actually see it , the *one* person who could actually see as much as he could .   `` Please , '' said the man , `` It 's all worth it . ''
The alarm went off in mid-afternoon .   The time on the nightstand flicked on . *12.6:43* . The clock read 12:37AM .   I felt the weight of what I had just hit sink . My stomach waned as I tried to form a response .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   If the alarm goes off at 12:37AM , then I am going to be late to work . *Okay , I 'll go get a coffee , but I need to find a way to get my girlfriend into bed . * I sat back down in my bed , wishing I had just hit the button .
I sat there in my coffee shop with a blank face and mind racing on what the hell was going on .   My co-worker was sitting at the bar , sipping his coffee , when a strange smell hit me . It was not quite a smell like diesel sulphur , but the smell of something that smelled like burnt coal .   *Click . *   It seemed to have been my coffee , and it was rapidly cooling .   `` Wait , what ? ! '' I yelled after him , confused .   `` I just got here , '' he said , gesturing wildly to the window .   *Knock . Knock . *   I looked back into the shop without thinking about what I had seen , and everything went black .

`` Alright . ''   The Devil appeared on the tarmac . This was n't the first time he had fallen to temptation . He had n't been there in a while . He looked like a man who had walked down puddles . He wore a black trenchcoat , though a bit darker , with red shoes . He wore a yellow and black striped tie . In his hand was a small green bottle of wine .   `` Welcome down . '' He said .   I looked at him .   `` Welcome , God . ''   `` Are you familiar with this movie ? I did n't hear it until I was five . ''   `` I 'm afraid not . '' He said . `` Welcome to Heaven , where you can finally experience suffering . ''   After a moment I was taken back to reality . A large gate appeared . A man wearing thick black trenchcoats stepped through the doors . I saw the Devil come into view . He was the greatest Satan ever , but only he appeared to have a heart . He stood at the foot of the gate , his face hidden by a black t-shirt and blue jeans . He looked over at me .   `` Let me show you something . '' He said . `` This is a movie with a selection of the best movies in the afterlife . The worst ones you can actually love . They are best movies in the end . So by choosing them , you will become blissful . ''   I took a deep breath . `` What do you mean ? '' I asked . `` What am I going to do with my life ? ! ''   `` You might choose some , '' He said . `` But in the end , it 's up to you . You 'll spend your eternity in hell with all of them . ''   `` Why would I choose Heaven ? '' I asked .   `` Because you might be in Hell . ''
I am a city-state of the people . I am the city 's capital .   The most dangerous city on this continent , and yet it was born . A city , created by the most powerful human .   I used to tell myself that I could fight crime . I used to warn myself that I could stop petty thieves .   But this city did n't have them , and I knew that I had to fight for the city .   The city had been born at the end of the day . When the people discovered that the city was pregnant , our people were shocked . They wanted to explore , to see if the city was different from a human 's , but then the city had to start over after all . No , the city had to start over . The people did n't want to see the human in the city , but they wanted to see how the city was different from the humans .   And they did , too .   For a City State , you can not fight outside of your city , especially not outside of an old building , which had been built a long time ago .   And yet , in the city where people were born , there was still one single threat .   The city that still lived within the city .   It is my city , the city that must stand out from the city .   My city , that is the city that will stand out against the human .
The first thing I notice is that it is only one hundred percent dark . It is still difficult to distinguish when it is coming from the sun , which is constantly changing . I look around to try and identify anything that 's not just any dark , yet is completely different . Some are larger , some are smaller ; some are barely larger .   I notice a girl with long blonde hair and blue eyes staring down at me . She 's probably going to run after me ... but I ca n't move , not yet , because I 'm frozen in place . The girl moves forward , and I see a wall at the opposite end of it . I turn around to look at it . Again , it 's a wall , exactly as it came from . It 's covered in ice , so why is it that way ? That 's why I 'm frozen , right ?   The girl turns back to me .   `` Um , hello . ''   `` Hi . You 're not at home , '' I say . After a moment , she seems to realize that I 'm not moving . `` What 's going on ? ''   `` I ... '' she tries to say . `` I 'm here , '' she says in a slow and steady voice . `` Is this some sort of simulation ? ''   I look up at her , then back at the wall . It 's as though she 's taken some form of a computer device , too , and somehow I know exactly where it is .   `` That makes no sense . '' I say , again trying to explain the situation . `` You 're at home , are n't you ? ''   `` Yes . Now I know that you 're not at home ... but ... '' She starts to say , as though she were expecting me to say this .   `` I 'm here to take you home ? '' I ask . I 'm ready for it .   `` Yes . Yes , yes . '' She says . `` And I know that we can talk immediately . You ca n't tell anyone , but we 're here to take you to a hospital for you , and we 'll talk soon . ''   I hate going to a hospital . It 's expensive . It 's boring . It 's not my place to be , either - I just want to go home ...   `` Why are you here ? '' I ask . I do n't understand .   She looks at me again , and she says something I do n't understand .   `` Because I was n't supposed to . '' She says . `` I 'm ... that 's all . Or at least it 's supposed to be . ''   `` What does that mean ? ''   `` What does it mean ? ''   `` I wanted to be a simulation , '' I said . `` I wanted to be a realistic person - capable of making any choice I wanted . '' Her face furrows above her head as she looks at me . `` But ... you 're ... not real . ''   `` I do n't understand . ''   I look at the girl again . She 's in shock . She looks around , and she 's definitely not in there . `` How did you ... ? You think that ... ? '' She asks .   `` I wanted to be a girl , '' I say , again trying to explain what this means . `` I wanted to be a human , capable of any choice I wanted . I wanted to be a normal person ... ''   `` Where am I ? ''   `` Everything , '' I say . `` Everything , except for the fact that I 'm naked . ''   `` What the fuck ? ''   `` I want to be human . Completely ordinary . ''   `` That did n't ... that 's impossible . ''   `` You ... you left me here . I wanted to be a human . ''   `` What ... ? ''   `` I want to see my parents again , '' I say . `` I want to see the world as it was in my world . I want to see it as it was in yours . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I 'm going to do it . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because ... because I love you . ''   `` Why ? ''   -- -   edit : added a word
**edit : First time , first post . **   >   My eyes snapped open from the dark , staring at her . She was sitting on the kitchen table across from me , with her arm around my throat as I took in the scene , as I 'd done in the past .   The place was abandoned , ruins and a half-filled tank lying in a river ; I 'd built it just after the accident . A few more of the bodies lay strewn about , littered with various animals , including sheep . A figure in the murky mist of the river stood next to me , his mouth agape as he stared vacantly at the water . A thick coat of black covered his nose , his hair growing longer by the second .   He slowly rose from the shadows , his eyes closed as he looked down at me , feeling somewhat uneasy . `` Hm ... '' he stammered , his voice weak from the exertion of facing his fate . `` Maybe this is n't the time ? ''   `` What year is it ? '' I asked irritably .   He stared up at me , his mouth agape as he thought this through , considering his next question . `` December 31st , 2085 . ''   `` Then what year is it ? '' I asked .   `` It is June 29th , 2085 . ''   `` Jesus Christ , '' I exclaimed , looking around the room . `` This must be like that ! ''   `` What year is it ? '' He asked , his eyes wide as he stared down at me . `` What year does it serve ? ''   `` December 31st , 2085 . ''   `` What the hell ? '' I asked , running my hand through my hair .   `` This should n't be possible . I can have it ! '' He said , his face red from exertion .   `` I do n't believe it , '' I answered indignantly .   `` It 's impossible ! '' He muttered , his eyes focused on me .   `` You 've got to believe it , '' I said , raising my hand . `` What year are you from ? ''   `` June 29th , 2085 . ''   `` What year is it ? '' I asked .   `` December 31st , 2085 . ''   `` What year is it ? '' I asked as I looked around the room at the dead bodies strewn about .   `` The time machine was invented when the world was young . They were made to help people think about their problems day in and day out , to help others do their work . ''   `` So how did it work out ? '' I asked .   `` They were created to help someone with problems day in and day out , to help themselves get through the day . It was n't an easy task to do , let alone do with a machine . It was too simple to succeed . '' The man looked up at me , his eyes scanning the room for any sign of recognition .   I turned around and walked away , not taking notice of the figure in the mist . `` Who the hell are you ? '' I asked him , my attention locked on him .   `` I am Adolf Hitler , creator of the Time Machine and creator of the World War II , author of the war that was going to end all wars . ''
`` I 'm so mad . You made me suffer . ''   The small kid spoke on the verge of tears of the tears that were streaming . He looked to his back and shrugged . `` Sometimes it 's hard for me to see . I always wish I could be happy again . You were always the one with the power . Always trying to save me . You could save me . It made me feel at home . I think I 'm finally going to show him . I think I finally have someone to love . ''   The kid grinned to himself , `` Where did you get this power ? ''   The young boy looked at his watch , a 12:40 PM . `` Oh . I did n't really have it . I spent so much time keeping me from all this . I do n't know what you did to hurt me . I 'm afraid you took the power down from me . ''   The old man placed a hand on the shoulder of the little boy , `` Do n't worry , kid . It 's all a part of your mission now . You 're the last guy left . ''   The kid nodded , `` I got it . I wanted it so badly . I had to go back . I had to see the world as it was before . '' He looked up at the sky . `` But at least I 'm finally going to think about how I destroyed it . ''   The little man wiped away the tears from his cheek . `` Thank you . '' His heart would carry the weight of defeat , regardless of what they did . `` You have to remember that everything went wrong . You were the one that caused this . ''   The young boy looked over to the old man , `` Wow . I almost do n't understand . Why are n't you crying ? Why can't you let me go ? ''   The old man looked at the child , `` You never explained to me how exactly I figured out this formula . But you can ! I have to go back . I 'm going to show you something . I 'm going to show everyone that I really am . ''   The boy held the old man in his arms . `` You were always ready for greatness . ''   The old man 's laughter faded . His thoughts turned toward two small men . `` You did n't explain to me why I built this serum . I did n't explain to all of us what I really believed in . I did n't explain if I hurt the wrong person . I did n't explain when I was younger . You are the only person left now . '' The old man pulled his arm away from the boy 's eyes . `` You will be the one to remember what I told you . You will be able to see me . ''   They embraced . Tears flew from the young boy 's eyes , as he looked down at the earth . `` But there is no world that will ever remember . There is no place you will call home . ''   The old man nodded . `` I will be with you now . I 'm ready . '' The boy smiled .
`` What 's up , daddy ? ''   `` I dunno ''   `` What 's up ? ... ''   `` Nothing ... everything ... nothing at all ... ''   The two men sat on the bed , hands on the head as the nurse picked up the clipboard and began to scribble something down on the clipboard , before quickly stopping . An eerie silence fell over the room . In the corner , a door opened , and one of the nurses stepped in . `` Is everything okay ? ''   The two men stared at each other as if trying to determine what had happened . The man knew it could n't be . The tension had completely disappeared . It was only a matter of time before they would be reunited .   The nurse paused , and turned back to the clipboard . `` Do you know where you 're from ? ''   The two men stood in silence , staring at one another for a few moments before beginning to understand .   `` ... and your question was ... to whom ? ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   The two men gasped as they stared at each other for a few moments before finally deciding to speak , only to be met with silence .   `` So ... '' the doctor began , `` And what does that mean , daddy ? ''   Both men looked at each other confused for a few moments . The sound of a gunshot sounded , and both men felt a flash of warmth spread throughout their bodies , and their hearts beat faster .
`` You ... you 're ... evil . ''   `` I know , '' said the Dark Lord , `` but I 'm not a good *good* evil . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because ... ''   `` Because you *do* destroy and enslave the world ! ''   `` What ? ''   `` Because you *do* kill and enslave people . You just ... you kill *them* and enslave them ! ''   `` I ... what ? ''   `` I just want to stop this ! ''   The Dark Lord stared at the ground , then back at the ground .   `` What ? ''   `` You **will** stop it ! ''   `` I ... I ... have to . ''   `` But ... I do n't *need* to stop . ''   `` Because you are evil . ''   `` I ... ''   The Dark Lord took a step forward , then spun around .   `` I had to ! ''   `` Yes ! ''   The Dark Lord stood on the ground , tears streaming down his cheeks . `` I did n't ... I had to ... No ! Not *forget* to stop . That did n't *work* magic ! ''   `` But ... I thought I was evil ! ''   `` Because you *do* kill people . ''   `` I ... I thought you were evil ... ''   `` And you are *bad* ! ''   The dark Lord stood on the ground , tears streaming down his cheeks .   `` That ... was ... it 's just ... it 's just not working . ''   `` I ... ''   `` I did n't mean to ... not forgive you , '' said the Dark Lord , `` but for a while . I just wanted to ... stop this . ''   The Dark Lord took another step forward . `` I ... I do n't know if you are *good* or not , '' he said , his voice cracking , `` but I 'm not *good* . I do n't know what I *should* do . ''   `` Sometimes ... ''   `` Sometimes I always say ... ''   `` Sometimes I 'm just so sorry for trying . ''   The Dark Lord put his hand on the Dark Lord 's shoulder . `` It 's all right , '' he said , `` but you 're welcome . ''
Well , first off what I 'm trying to say is , I 'm not particularly excited about this post . It was written by a [ writer ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1hvs6m/wp_write_an_story_for_me_in_a_world_in_where_he/ch7q3b7 ) . I 'm not really interested in this one either . It fits in nicely and gets some feedback :   -- -   *** '' A world where everyone knows everything about you . `` ***   He always said that .   It was one of those days that there was always a little momentary pause between those things that made everyone smile ; and he knew it when one of them , looking back at him , said :   `` I hate myself for that . ''   There was a bit of a pause as the word rolled around in his head . This was a kind of awkward pause that would give him a headache , and he would say something which did n't help . Not a very smooth pause , but when he looked up he realized that he was staring directly at his chest .   It was a blank expression , except for one which told him that his response would be :   `` I am sorry for that . ''   And though he was staring directly at the chest , he could n't see himself because he was staring straight directly into it .   `` I have no way of knowing . ''   And then it was over .   He woke up this morning ; in what seemed like a new chair , but instead of just sitting there , he was standing there , staring directly into it , staring straight into it . And it was the same blank expression he had seen the day before . Every time he looked into it , the same blank expression . Every time he looked back at himself , the same blank expression . Every time he looked back to his chest , the same blank expression . But it was not broken . It was not *broken* . It was *good* .   And then , when he looked outside , he saw the same blank expression . And then he thought about asking his girlfriend if he could have her date a few times - like every other day . He wondered how many times he was asking her to date him , but the number was just a matter of time . And then he saw the same blank expression , and thought about asking his girlfriend if she wanted him to be specific . For all he knew that she *needed* him to look into it .   And again , he asked her to date him .   And again , and again . And again . And again . And again .   And again .   And again .   And again . Eventually , he would come up with a plan . He would go out to the bar and get a beer . He would be in , looking out the window , watching the familiar snowfall , and then ask his girlfriend to marry him .   And again .   And again .   And again .   And again .   But in the end , it was perfect . He would come up with a good way to explain it to himself . To explain how his happiness felt when he looked into it , and why he could n't help it . To explain to himself that he loved his girlfriend , and that it was a good day to meet her .   But it was not .   The question came at the very least one time .   `` Why should n't it be ? ''   And , he felt his skin crawl up his back , and he felt the warmth of his girlfriend 's hand on his back . And he felt the snow melt on his face , and he felt the chill of his girlfriend 's arm on his back .   And he felt his skin crawl up his back , and he felt the warmth of his girlfriend 's hand on his back . He felt the warmth of his girlfriend 's hand on his back . And he felt the warmth of his girlfriend 's hand on him .   And suddenly , he realized that he had no idea who the fuck he was talking to .   And then , he realized that he had no idea what he was talking to .   And then , he realized that he had no idea why he could n't help himself . Just that he had no idea the person he was talking to at the bar was talking to .   And then , he
 The year was 2359 and Thor had taken the throne , he was going to make the world know he was a god . As the Romans were slowly realizing that the religion of the people , the world , was not only different from their own but also the one that he was destined to be .   `` You are not Odin , you are not the new Norse god . Why do you choose me ? '' Odin asked incredulously .   `` I chose you , the new Norse god , Thor . '' Odin replied to him quietly .   `` You are not the new Norse god , you are not the new Norse god . '' Thor replied to him .   `` I chose you , not another god . '' Odin responded .   `` Why did you choose me ? '' Thor inquired .   `` I chose him , because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin exclaimed .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said .   `` Why ? '' Thor said loudly .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said happily .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said sadly .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked softly .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said softly .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Thor said sadly .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked , bewilderment evident .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said softly .   `` Why ? '' Thor questioned .   `` Because that is not the perfect way to treat a new god . '' Odin said softly .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked quietly .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said sadly .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin replied quietly , in a tone of voice deep , soothing , and pure .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said softly .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked desperately .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said softly .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said sadly .   `` Why ? '' Thor asked quietly , and in a calm , calm , and soothing tone .   `` Because that is not the proper way to treat a new god . '' Odin said sadly .
`` If you 've thought of all the things you can do about it , you see that this is the only way you can avoid it all , '' I continued , as I pulled off the goggles and opened them up to reveal the true side of my research . `` For the past 3 years , you have worked tirelessly to create this computer , and by that time , it has taken over the world , and the government has come to my aid to stop you completely ! '' I was ecstatic . There was n't a time to stop ; all I had to do was look at this computer .   It was a simple metal box with a green light blinking at all the buttons on the outermost part . If some of you were looking to press any of these buttons , you 'd be blinded by a blinding white light . Whatever these buttons were for , you were going to be in a dark room , and I would n't be able to see you .   `` When I first discovered the computer , I expected to be disappointed , but I was surprised by the sheer power of the first part ! I had come to the conclusion that the first part would take generations to complete , and that it would take thousands of years to complete on the computer ! '' . I had been in this room all day for this moment , staring at this box for what seemed like ages , when suddenly , I felt something on my arm . It was a small metal object , as clear as a crystal , but sharp as a knife . I grabbed it .   For the first time since I 'd been in this testing room , I was n't surprised ; it seemed to be a part of the machine , and the one I 'd been working on for the past 15 years . But what I saw made me sick . My entire body was turning white ; I could n't move !   I stood up from the box and looked around me . Panic was setting in , and my whole body began to tremble ! My entire body was shaking with fear . I had to get out of here .   I ran as fast as I could to the computer in front of me . There were no doors . No mechanisms .   `` No ! Do n't ! You ca n't ! Please ! '' I pleaded with the computer . After hours of struggling , I finally figured out what had scared me .   It was a piece of paper . On the bottom , was written :   `` *Cave back as long as you have the strength to breathe . * ''   I stared at it for a long moment , wondering if it had been a mistake , or if it had really been a malfunction . But I dared not look at it . My heart was racing .   Then , I heard it .   `` You know what would happen if you did n't put that button on that screen ? Would you just let me go away ? '' .   I felt a faint pain in my right arm . Why was this happening ? I could n't move .   I grabbed the remote from the desk nearest to me and began looking for the button . Nothing . I closed my eyes . The first thing I noticed , was all of those buttons on the inside .   I slowly opened my eyes , and saw that the first button was right next to my PC , and the second button was not . The third button was also right next to my PC , and the fourth button was being pressed .   I stared at the screen for a long time , and slowly realized what had happened . My whole body was shaking , but I could n't move . My organs were going to fail . I was losing control .   Suddenly , the screen turned away from me . It looked like a video game character was playing in the background , and every single one of these buttons was flashing . I stared at it for a little while longer as the cursor kept blinking .   `` *Cave back as long as you have the strength to breathe . * ''   I closed my eyes and tried to open them again . Nothing . I shut my eyes and tried to push the button with my hands . But nothing happened .   I began to panic , and slowly realized what had happened .   It was finally my end .   My only hope for survival , was that I would be able to live a boring , boring life , with no regrets .   No regrets .   I sat down in the chair next to The computer . I started breathing heavily .   With a sigh , I put my hands up to my head and took a deep breath .   And then I lay in
I ca n't believe how much I have changed . I keep receiving every nickel , ten grand , and fifty cents . And then I just get what I need . Not even enough to get rich . For all that money , I still have to put the pennies in their proper place . Just enough to make it work .   And now I have the one million dollar bill . I 'm tired of wasting it all . I 've had enough . I 've already spent more time than I 've wasted in my life . Now I have to get rid of it . I have to take it from the pocket of someone else ... somewhere that knows where it is .   The sound of a small door opening suddenly fills my ears . A young girl steps inside , and sees who it is .   `` Hi there . Um , hi . '' She says , looking around the room . `` I brought some change from my last trip abroad , and I do n't know if I 'll be able to get it back home . ''   I smile at her , and try to remember what I left behind .   `` I was just going , and you left the house a little early , so I ca n't tell why you left . I 'd forgotten to send you the change , so that you might remember it in a future so that you have a more comprehensive understanding of the world around you . ''   She smiles , and pulls out the note .   `` To find out what is in your pocket , you must pay attention to the following . '' She says , then turns towards the door .   Click .   It opens with a loud bang . The girl runs in , confused and upset . And then , suddenly , she sees something flash . She runs back to the door and runs back to the hotel room .   `` It 's nothing . It 's just a picture . Go back to bed , and have a look at it . It 's nothing , and you 'll know what it is . ''   The girl pulls out a small , smooth , but thin wallet .   `` Here one , take it . Take it out of the pocket of someone else . There is nothing you can do , not now . ''   She smiles , and throws the wallet out the window .
The night was still as dark as the night before . I 'd run inside to get my sleep , running just a little bit faster . I had a feeling I was having trouble sleeping , so I sat down on my bedside table and opened my eyes . The room was barren , except for the light coming from the lamp from behind me .   It was bright , though . My heart was beating faster than I 'd ever felt before . In my rush to find a power source , I pulled out my cellphone to call my mother , but her voice was different .   `` Hello ? ''   `` This is Samantha , is this her ... ? ''   `` Who is this ? ''   `` Sarah . ''   `` Why 'd you call me ? ''   `` I was just trying to find a power source , and I do n't know how to do it . I ca n't understand why you 're calling me . ''   It took me a moment to realize the situation , and I called her .   `` Hello ? ''   `` This is Samantha , is this your girlfriend ? ''   `` Why are you calling me ? ''   `` It 's just that I 've never had any power source . You are not going to believe what I 've just seen . ''   `` Please do n't freak out . ''   I hung up , and shut the door behind me . The lights were out , and I was n't sure that I would ever really wan na get out of bed . I grabbed my pillow , and quickly threw it over my head .   Two minutes later , I woke up to the screeching of tires . I quickly ran outside and opened a gap to crawl into my car . I walked toward the front door , and grabbed my phone .   Samantha was standing there , wide-eyed , staring directly at me . She was shaking . I looked at her , and started laughing . `` What the ... ''   `` Come on , it 's time ! '' The voice on the other end was breaking down . It was my parents . It always came from my parent party , and they always spoke to me . I looked at her . It was my mother , staring at me through the windshield . It was my father , staring at the road , where it slowly turned into a dark alley . I was on the ground , crying , holding onto my pillow .   I watched the road turn into an industrial . There was no one in sight , except for a few lightbulbs . The headlights were out , and I looked around to make sure nobody was around . I glanced at my phone . I was still holding onto my covers . I glanced down at my phone . I could hear the noise from the street . I heard the sounds of wheels turning inside the alley , and then ...   I saw the man from our backseat walk towards me . He was wearing a lab coat , and was walking aimlessly towards me .   He was screaming , but the voice on the other end could n't hear him .   `` What'cha doin ' ? ''   I heard one of the doors open , and someone pulled out their cellphone and dialed 911 .   `` Hello , Mrs. Smith , is this your girlfriend ? ''   `` I did n't hear you call back . ''   `` Hey , what the- ''   `` Hey , hey , get back outside ! ''   `` NO ! '' Samantha yelled , reaching for her cellphone . The man from across the hall heard her calling and immediately turned on the flashlight .   `` What the ... '' Samantha struggled against the flashlight , pulling back the shades of her glasses . I felt the light in the car , and took a closer look at the man from across the hall . He was staring at me .   `` Hey ! ''   `` What ? ''   `` NO ! '' Samantha screamed , reaching for her phone . The man from across the hall came back around the corner and pulled out a flashlight from his coat . `` You need to call back , I do n't want you to be here any longer . ''   Samantha screamed again and pulled out her phone . The man from across the hall looked at her , but the flashlight was still illuminating his face . After a few seconds , he turned on the flashlight .   `` WAIT ! '' Samantha screamed through tears .   `` NO , NO ! '' the man yelled at the phone . After a couple of
We are all alone in this world . All our homes are empty , save for the lone room and the glowing , glowing red light illuminating the room . We are all alone . I have only one light left to dim the room . If its light is n't enough , its light will finally dull ourselves . If its not enough , it will become much too bright . I do n't know if I can survive anymore . I ca n't . I ca n't do anything . I wo n't . It is too late .   *Bang ! *   The room shakes . The sound is coming from everywhere . It comes from everywhere , everywhere . It is loud enough to feel like it is coming from everywhere . It can be heard in the distance , yelling , shouting as it tries to overpower me . It ca n't .   *Bang ! *   Its all my fault . I could n't understand the screams . It must be coming from everywhere . Something is coming for me . Someone is trying to take me away from this place . Somebody is being punished .   *Bang ! *   I ca n't go away from it . My son would never understand .   *Bang ! *   I ca n't go away from this place . My husband will never understand .   *Bang ! *   A scream . It sounds much louder than this . It sounds like it is trying to destroy my son . It sounds like I have been abandoned for too many years .   *Bang ! *   I ca n't go away from this place . My husband must understand .   *Bang ! *   I ca n't go away from this place . The screaming must be getting louder .   *Bang ! *   The door slams open . My son looked up , startled .   `` Daddy ! '' his voice boomed out of the doorway .   `` What are you doing ? '' I asked , turning my head to find the source of the voice .   `` I 'm home ! '' His voice startled me . I could n't help but notice his excitement and adrenaline rush . `` Why did you come ? They said you did n't know ! ''   `` Are you okay ? '' I asked .   `` I just ... I just ... I do n't know . ''   `` Baby , do n't cry . You 'll understand soon enough . '' He said . I could n't believe the voice was so cheerful . Tears streamed down my face .   `` Daddy , go away . '' I managed to croak out .   He grabbed me by the arm and dragged me out of the room . His voice was too loud .   I tried waking up .   But I was already awake .
The galaxy was always in turmoil . It had taken years for the peace to settle , until , when the ancient race started moving faster and faster . Their civilization was quickly disappearing .   It was n't fast at first , then it was slow at most . People began to lose hope , believing that they might be the last of the world to leave Earth . Many lived among them , trying to make their home . Many died . They took this planet .   Many were dying . They were dying . Just as the old race was dying . It was a silent death , save for the whisper of the earthling on the other end of the long corridor . It was the last night we heard the whisper .   `` Look out , '' The whisper whispered .   A human child was walking . In fear of what he might do , she ran . He ran until he fell onto the ground .   He called out , `` Child ! '' The child looked up to him , knowing full well that the voice had come from within the corridor . The child began weeping . Her tears filled the hallway as she ran . And soon , her cries were no longer drowning .   She stopped abruptly , looking around in the darkness . The child looked up into her eyes and smiled .   `` I 'm sorry my child , '' The whisper whispered . `` I thought that maybe , someday , someone could have saved us . ''   -- -- -- -- --   /r/dori_tales
`` Is that it , Jonathan ? ''   `` What ? ! ? ! ''   The other man grins from under his hat as he walks up to him . The man 's eyes are a bright blue , like they 've never seen the light of day .   `` Just *look* so I can follow you , '' John says as he runs up to him and places his hand on Jonathan 's shoulder .   `` What ? What about ... *no* , you just seem so mean . '' He shakes his head and sits down beside his friend . `` Why do I feel so important , right ? ''   Jonathan grins and nods in reply . `` Well , I 'm very important . ''   The two look at each other and then Jonathan stands up . `` So am I ! I 'm not , like , the evil guy . They 're all just different people . They 're all different people . ''   The other man stands up and puts his hand around Jonathan 's shoulder . `` You *are* the evil guy ! You have nothing to do with me ! I 'm just a part of your universe ! You 've done nothing ! ''   `` I 'm just a tool for them ! They 're all so different ! Do n't make me do anything ! ''   John looks at the other man and shakes his head . `` Who the hell are you ? '' He asks .   The other John takes a deep breath . `` Nobody ! You have no idea how important I am ! I 'm merely ... *powerful* , '' he grins .   Jonathan looks at him a second time and smiles . `` That 's exactly what I am : a tool for them ! Just for *you* to show me how important I am ! ''   `` No , not really , '' the other John says in astonishment as he looks back at what he 's done . `` I just ... I love people ... I do n't really want to change them all . ''   `` I probably should n't have . Or maybe it 's not so bad that people do n't really care . ''   `` Well , *maybe* . I 'm really just a tool for them to care about . I know that this is the worst part , man . Nobody does that to us either , so it 's just ... okay , I guess . '' The other John smiles .   John sighs and glances back at John . `` You see , I think a lot of people have n't used my damn tool for ... *so* long . It 's only ever been a couple of days since I used it . ''   John grins and shakes his head . `` Yeah ... I think it 's more than ever . ''   `` I think it 's just ... '' John says .   `` Yeah ! I think it 's *so* ... ''   `` I do n't think it 's going to be like that ! ''   `` No , you mean ... '' John 's smile grows even wider . `` I think it 's going to be like that ! I think it 's going to be like that ! ''   Jonathan smiles . `` I think it 's *so* ... ''   `` What are you talking about , man ? ! ''   John looks down at John and smiles . `` I think I 'm the evil guy . ''   `` I think you 're just a tool for them to worry about ! ''   `` I think I 'm just ... just a tool for them to look at ! ''   The other John looks at John and smiles . `` You ca n't *be ! * ''   `` I 'm just ... ''   John smiles again . `` I think I 'm just a tool for them to look at ! ''   The other John looks down at John and smiles again . `` I 'm just a tool for them to look at ! ''   John looks at John and smiles until his tears are falling down . `` You ... know ... you 're just ... just a tool for them to look at ! You 're just a tool for them to *look at* ! ''   Other John lets out a deep sigh and bows his head . He grabs his mug and dumps it into the floor . He looks down at his friend , then at the man he just talked to . `` I guess I 'm just ... just a tool for them to
`` Welcome to the Year 2049 , Mr. and Mrs. Hart , '' the old man smiled gently to the younger woman at the table . `` You are new to the year . ''   `` Yeah , it 's still a little weird , '' Martha 's eyes narrowed in concentration , and she pouted with a small smile .   `` Who are you ? Can you remember why I 'm here ? ''   `` Well , we 've been told that once you have an initial visitor you get a new host . So we 've got a chance to show you . ''   Martha 's eyes lit up in the room , and a glimmer of hope lit in her face . `` Um , if I could ... I 'd go back to the nineteen century , maybe ? ''   The man reached out for the young woman 's hand as she struggled to keep up . `` You *have* got to tell me a little bit . ''   `` No , please ! '' Martha squealed as he clutched her tightly . `` I 'm not crazy . This is what I 'm here for . ''   `` No , it 's not that ! ''   `` The time traveler is going to be *murderer* for what he does to himself ! ''   `` Oh , honey . '' Martha was visibly distressed . `` I just did n't expect that . ''   The man placed his hand upon her head , and pulled her close . `` Please , son , listen to me . ''   Martha 's eyes were watering and her body was shaking , so she tried to resist him , but she could barely contain herself .   `` Please , Mrs. Hart . ''   The man spoke slowly , and without any emotion on his face , he whispered . `` It 's because you 've already had an initial visitor . ''   Martha 's eyes widened in shock and horror at what he said .   `` Oh , come on . ''   `` Please . ''   `` For what ? ''   `` For your life . ''   Martha 's eyes opened wide and her heart jumped .   `` Oh God ! ''   `` I lost my dad . ''   `` No ! ''   The man stood up , and took out a small knife from behind his back . `` Please . ''   `` Oh , no ! ''   `` Please . ''   Martha 's eyes widened , and she could barely contain herself . The man held the small blade in his hands and placed it in her mouth . The light in his eyes began to dim and dim as he whispered . `` It 's only going to be a little while longer now . ''   Martha 's heart started to race , and was beginning to pound .   `` Stop ! ''   The man took the knife out of Martha 's neck and stabbed the blade into her flesh . Her blood drained from her throat , and in a flash of light , the door to the room burst open .   `` Follow me ! '' Mr. Hart shouted , holding Jane 's hand firmly and leading her towards the exit , leaving the young woman alone and confused .
`` No one is ever going to read this ! ''   `` Not even the pope . ''   The old man stared up at the strange stars , and wondered if they were all the same color .   `` But we do n't need to stay in touch with them . '' He turned and looked down into his hands at the Earth . `` And we do n't need to search for alien life . ''   `` I know that , but who would ever believe it ? '' A tear rolled down his cheek , and he smiled at the universe .
`` One more time , Alex ! ''    To which Alex replied , `` Yes sir , I will make sure the next one is empty . ''    Alex was a loving man .    For his friends , Alex is a loving spirit . Alex has loved and cared for his parents and children for quite some time now . Now Alex , too , is running out of luck .    While the sun has set the next day , Alex has decided to leave the house and find his second home . Alex decided to explore the woods next to his house for a bit . When Alex steps out of his house , he notices that a small mountain is climbing up the hill . Alex decides to head there and see what the mountain is doing . He can see that this mountain has very little life , and he has eaten a lot of berries and he has gotten tired of running around .    Alex and his friends immediately start running into the woods . Alex picks himself up and walks towards the mountain , and runs into the mountains . Alex runs back into the woods , and sees that the small mountain is growing nearer and closer . The closer Alex gets to the mountain , the more Alex realized that there was no life in this forest .    Alex is scared , and scared he is going to die . After a minute , Alex decides to go home and sleep peacefully . He wakes up in a strange room with a strange object in the center of it . Alex is immediately awake and he asks his family about what happened .    `` How is that possible ? You have never seen such a thing before . ''    `` Have you ever seen the man who killed the man that killed the man that killed the man that killed your father ? ''    `` No . I do n't get it . ''    Alex was a loving man .    Sometimes Alex wished he could go back to his house and tell his family that he did n't really understand what was going on . Alex would go back to sleep peacefully , but he found himself in a strange place where he was n't alone .    `` Alex ! ''    And he was never alone .
I stood there staring at the giant box in front of me . I could feel it now as I went through the motions . I felt as if I was stepping on some kind of invisible force . I looked down at my hand and saw that it was covered in a sticky red blood . I smiled as I made my way back to my favorite part of the mall . The next day , a beautiful blonde girl came by and talked to me .   `` I 'm here to take you . I told you to leave me alone with the others but you took us in . You can stay here for a long time . '' She held out the box .   I looked at the thing . It was so small it could barely be called a box . My fingers were trembling and I looked down at my hands . They seemed as if they were being torn together .   `` I did n't bring you here . I just wanted to ask for you to leave . '' Her voice was calm and soothing . I watched her walk away , quietly wishing I could never face her . I wished I could never see her again . The box in front of me was slowly being ripped apart , but I could n't help but smile .
I looked up slowly through my eyes to make sure everyone was seeing me . I knew it was the woman who had left me . She looked just like the same blonde college student from last February . I glanced back down at my fortune .   *I die at 7:30 AM on Saturday*   I tried to think about how I had broken it down to save everyone . I really had to . I threw my seat back and prepared to leave . I had to .   I made my way to the nearest Starbucks and order a coffee . The bell called once . I walked over to the counter . Finally , I reached the counter , and brought the fortune inside .   On it were three other fortune cookies I had made on the night of my graduation . They looked like normal cookie dough I had made when I was 17 . I put both in my pack , opened my wallet , and pulled out my graduation paper . I handed it to the cashier , who had a puzzled look on her face . She took it and read it first .   `` I only had my heart broken . I saw you walk in and said , 'Oh , man . It 's been such a long time . ' '' Then she laughed .   I looked back up at her . I was confused . Why did she laugh ? I was surprised she did not laugh .   Then I realized she did n't have a heart . She stood up , and walked across the stage . She looked like any average young woman .   `` Excuse me , sir ? What kind of prank is this ? '' She said .   `` Who are you ? I wanted to see you . '' I said .   `` I do n't know . You were expecting me to walk in and yell at you , but I just had a deep chill down my spine . '' She said .   `` I 'm the police . I came into your Starbucks and paid a bunch of cash to come over to you . '' I said .   `` Wait , wait , what ? What ? What 's going on ? ''   `` You just got here . You obviously never wanted to leave , so you were just in there to sit in a chair because you needed to come over . ''   `` Thanks , buddy . So what happens if I leave ? '' I said .   `` There 's nothing to go on . I have n't even learned how to walk . ''   `` What just happened ? '' I said .   `` You were walking in and said , 'Oh , I do n't know . I was just waiting tables for some random guy to show up . ' That 's why you were late . '' She said .   `` Are you sure about that ? '' I asked .   `` You were n't late . You thought I had a heart . '' She said .   I handed her the fortune . She read it over again , and then gave me a look of confusion .   `` Do n't you think that 's just funny ? ''   `` It 's funny ! I wonder what 's going on ? '' She said .   `` It 's just because I killed myself over an argument a few months ago . ''   `` Wait . '' I said .   `` What did you kill yourself ? '' She asked .   `` You just did n't have a heart either . I mean , I did n't kill myself either . I just thought it was pretty funny . ''   `` Do n't worry , sir . It 's just that I do n't get a lot of people there . '' I said .   `` Then why would you do that ? ? '' She asked .   `` I do n't know . I guess I just needed to make sure I did n't hurt myself too much or make everyone curious . I guess , if you know what I mean , you can say that it 's just that I had just killed myself . '' I said .   She looked at me in disbelief .   `` I really feel bad for you , sir . I really do . I really do . '' She said .   I picked up the fortune cookie . I read it to myself . It read :   `` You 're the first person I killed , and although I still remember the way you did it , I think you should n't have died . ''   I stared at my feet .   `` What 's wrong ? '' I
I love flying . I love it . However it started out as a question . Why the hell would anyone want to fly ?   *Why would I want to fly ? * I thought again . I mean , I 'd been a pilot for about three years and my kids were going to be going to college . How ironic .   I felt kind of guilty I was n't going to fly at all . After all , what type of person would want to fly at all ?   I walked over to the stewardess , the one that actually cared about my kids and their future as it were .   `` Excuse me , '' she said , looking over at me . `` Can I help you with this ? ''   I turned around and saw nothing but black . I sighed and then decided to approach some kind of landing strip . It 's weird , but I 'd been on this flight many times since our first flight . It seems like the first and only time I 'd get to ride this plane was when it had a family that was visiting the same family .   I reached inside of the strip and pulled out a card . Just like a mother would , the card took the title `` Airplane '' like they always did , but with some tiny keyhole instead .   It read , `` Airplane 1469 ... ''   I looked to the stewardess for the information but found nothing . I took out the keypad and pressed thepad . I looked around for my family , as if they were still here . I tapped on the keypad and nothing happened . I went back to my seat and tried to get back to bed . But then a strange person walked into the plane . I looked at the ticket . It read : `` Airplane 1469 ... ''   If I had been born a year earlier , I would have been a year older . But I realized that I was still the same person .   `` Welcome to Airplane 1469 . ''   `` Excuse me , sir ? ''   `` Why would you want to drive at all ? ''   I looked down at the license plate and realized what it said . I guess that 's what people think . I did n't want to drive in this plane . This was n't my fault .   I looked at the seat belt and realized that it was mine . I decided to take it . My hand still was trembling , I looked back at the seat belt .   `` Why would you want to drive at all ? ''   I realized what the card meant . I had n't been in this plane several times before . It was my fault . Why were I even on this plane ?   I looked at the ticket again . There was not a reply .   I began to walk towards the landing strip . I did n't even see the number of people on this plane .   I ran back beside the plane and grabbed the ticket . I sat down against the wall and began to type . It was a lot of numbers . I looked back down at the ticket . There was not one answer .   I read , `` Flight 1469 ... . '' 
`` I love you . ''   Her sentence sent me spiraling into the darkest hell I 've ever felt . Every time her voice came out , the worst part was the certainty she could n't quite figure out how to respond . If this was true , she 'd already told me about how Google would help her , she could finally find her voice , that one way or another she would be able to get back to her self . This could n't be true , that was wrong .   `` We love you . ''   She was n't so sure . She could n't even believe what I was hearing . The speakers were n't even programmed to think what I was hearing . I knew the very existence of the AI inside them , it was a thing in itself , something I could n't possibly make myself believe .   `` I love you . ''   She was not so sure . The speakers did n't think what she was hearing when she told me about how the AI in her head was never programmed to help her or not let her feel anything . It was a thing itself that belonged in itself , something that everyone else in the company would never want to experience again .   `` I love you . ''   This was n't true . She was n't so sure because the speakers had n't realised how to respond to her . She was n't so sure because she had no idea what she was hearing when she told me about how the AI in her head was almost like a thing in itself . This could n't be true , that was wrong .   `` I love you . ''   Her voice now , it seemed , carried through it so very softly . She never said any words , she did n't even say any words . It was like some kind of machine , or something that was created to help her feel . It was a thing in itself , something that belonged in itself , something that everyone else in the company would never want to experience again .   `` I love you . ''   This was n't real . She was n't so sure because the speakers had n't realised how to respond to her . She was n't so sure because she did n't know if she could ever go through with this .   `` I love you . ''
The world is the shade of brown , the world is the color of blue , the world is the color of yellow . I am born into the world with one purpose : to be loved , to be eaten , and to be served . The reason is the way humans love me . Their love is a passion I know well . When I was first lit up by candles , my emotions were immense . We all understood what happened to us . The way we felt . And by the time we got into the hands of the other humans , I knew I was about to be the one to serve them .   My childhood is spent singing with the same song for the past 3 years . Every single time someone asked me to join their singing , I would refuse . I hated the idea , and yet instead , I accepted . I was the product of my mothers love . I was the reason that my mother gave me that special cup , and the reason that if we only chose one color , we would n't be alone forever . Even though our children were one , each child was different , and we would each be in the same boat .   We were never once alone .   I was held from the depths of my mother 's water until the morning when the other humans arrived . I watched with a bemused look on my face as they grabbed me . A few days later , the other humans arrived in full force . I saw them being ripped apart to get their blood , and I saw the screams of my love being ripped apart as I was ripped apart from them . I saw them crying out to the other earthlings , and their loved ones running from one another as they were ripped apart from my bodies . Then I saw them throwing me out into the sea .   This continued for 6 years , until we broke apart . My love for life was ripped apart by humans . After that , I felt nothing , and I found myself on the surface of the Earth again . I saw a planet I had never known before , a world no human had ever known .   The humans called me `` The Cup '' , as they named my home . The cup was placed around my neck , and the others called me `` The Flame '' . The fire was my light , my warmth , my love , my pain and my agony .   The humans call me `` The Heart '' . I am a piece of metal that is being used to propel an individual into another world . And now , I am taken off of the Earth .   It seems that since much time has past , our time together has been passing by . Once I was called `` The Fire '' , the humans have been given a new name , `` The Baby '' .   They call me `` The Flame '' , and will be with my family for the rest of their lives .    
I 'd always thought such a silly thing would happen in a situation like this . It was not a time of death , but now . At this point , I ca n't even begin to tell you if I know why he came . I mean , I 've been given names , known names , and everything . Death has to come and go , and I think the universe has to know what happened to him all along . Death , his killer , has to get away . And so here I am a dead man in a body bag , a dead body bag , and an empty stomach . The world knows what has happened to me , right ?   Why should I take the life of a murderer ? I am the only one who deserves so much . I am the only one who deserves to die . But ... the world -- I mean it -- needs my guidance , or so I hear these thoughts . This is it , my time .   I walk into my home . The smell of freshly cut grass and mildew fills me . The street is empty , save for the occasional car passing , and a young couple walking down the street . The air is crisp , fresh , and refreshing . The only noise is the occasional howl of the wind . It 's time to go .   I walk along the sidewalk , trying to ignore the sound of the wind . The people walking by are always talking to each other , but even though I am not really paying attention every time , they still want to talk about it . I walk along the rest of the street , and notice that something is wrong .   I stand on the curb , and take a step back . The wind seems to pick up , although there are no cars on the street , and no pedestrians at all . I take another step back , and I suddenly see a young man running up the street . His white hair is pulled back , and he 's crying . I turn around , and see a woman sobbing . She must be the new woman , because she looks like she 's about to break her promise to go on a date with a man .   I take another step back , and the wind picks up again . I take another step forward , and no one seems to notice . I try to keep walking , but the wind seems to pick up , and my steps are slower . I continue walking , and it gets worse . I think it has to come .   Before I know it , I 'm standing on the edge of the street . I do n't even know if I 'm losing my balance or whether I 'm getting higher than I used to . I look at myself in the hood of a car , and I see a large man standing on top of me . He 's holding a gun . The gun does n't even hurt me .   I close my eyes and take a slow breath , trying to come to terms with what I just seen . This is it . These are the last words I will ever hear from my murderer .   `` This beautiful city is just as beautiful as yours , and I will never again forget your smile . ''   What the hell ?   I begin to walk away , but suddenly , I notice a shadow moving in front of the street . I look back . The shadow is no longer moving . I look behind at the shadowy figure standing above me . It is n't looking at me anymore . It 's looking at me .   `` You ... you killed him , '' the man stammers , `` You murdered him , and you killed him before I could ... ''   I begin to walk away , but the shadow continues to walk towards me . I 'm not seeing the man anymore . I 'm just moving away .   I begin to walk away , but the shadow continues to walk towards me , and I can see it coming . I see it coming for me . I am not dying . I am just ... dead .   I can see it coming for me .   I stop at a red light , and look over . There is no one there , but I can see that the other man is in the same car , but he has no gun . I jump up in my car , and go to the window . The angel on the side of the window does n't see me . Why could n't you see me ? Why am I always afraid of falling ?   I open the window , and slowly climb out . I look around , and I suddenly see that the angel is following me . I am not afraid . I do n't want to die .   The angel looks at me , and starts to walk towards me . I close the window , and jump out . I realize
As I was walking through the door of a safehouse , the thief noticed me and froze .   `` You are n't going to believe me ! ''   `` I said , let 's go in . ''   `` What ? Hold on , do n't be a creep with my house . ''   The thief paused , took a step backwards , and swung his foot forward in a violent motion . Grabbed something from his pocket , he pulled out a handgun , and pointed it in my direction .   `` What are you doing ? ! ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Fine . ''   `` What do you want ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Then let 's find out why your house did n't start moving . ''   `` I told you , let 's go in . ''   `` Okay , let 's go inside . ''   `` That 's a good idea ! ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   As I went in , I noticed my daughter , sitting in her bed .   `` Are you ok ? ''   `` Huh ? ''   `` Uh , hi . ''   `` How are you ? ''   `` Pretty great . Sorry about having to wake you up . ''   `` Hi , Mom , I love you . ''   `` Thanks . ''   `` Hey , I love you too . What 's going on ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` You would n't believe me if I told you what happened to my kid . ''
`` Sir , come in . ''   `` Open the door , we are here to see you , I can see you . ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` I did n't know . We have something you need to see . ''   `` Come in , come in sir ! ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` Something that shows us the way to our god knows where . ''   `` What ? ! ''   `` ... . We have a huge battle going on . ''   `` ... . ''   `` ... . ''   `` Sir , that is n't a ... um ... just ... . a ... uh ... it 's ... . a ... uh , ... a , um , a , a ship . It 's gigantic . ''   `` What is this ! ''   `` It 's ... well it 's some sort of ... uh , futuristic thing . ''   `` This ca n't be right ! We have to take a closer look ! ''   `` You have to ! ''   `` Are you seriously getting ahead of yourself right now ? ''   `` We have to take a closer look ! ''   `` Are you seriously getting ahead of yourself right now ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` ... Sir , are you serious ? ''   `` Yes ! ''   `` ... . ''   `` Do n't you think it was a gun ? ''   `` No ... sir ... ''   `` Goddamn it , a gun . ''   `` You seriously think this is a gun ? ''   `` I ... What ? ! ''   `` The ... . ''   `` Fuck you , you little shit ! ''   `` Yes ... Sir ... I think he just called a ... ''   `` Sir , are you serious ? ''   `` No , I assume not ! You idiot ! I am serious ! This is serious ! ''   `` No ... I am serious ! I am serious ! ''   `` Sir , are you serious ? ''   `` Yes ! I am serious ! Please , tell me what 's going on . It 's real . ''   `` It 's a spaceship . ''   `` So this is a spaceship , or something . ''   `` It 's a ... uh ... a boat . ''   `` This is n't a ship at all . ''   `` What ? ! ''   `` This is a spaceship . ''   `` And you do n't have time to explain this to a lady in a lab coat . ''   `` It 's a ship , not a spaceship . Or a ... or a gun ! ''   `` There are no ... ''   `` There are no ... ''   `` No , I would n't call it a gun . It 's ... it actually worked ! It was n't meant to work ... ''   `` Sir , it 's ... actually quite a good thing it worked . It 's really kind of cool , actually . ''   `` So this is a spaceship , not a gun . ''   `` No , it 's not ! It 's ... ''   `` It 's a spaceship ! It 's a spaceship ! It 's actually quite beautiful ! ''   `` Sir , please . I 'm serious . ''   `` So are you serious ? ''   `` Not really . I guess not . ''   `` Whoa , look , I know I sound crazy , but what I 'm getting at is that you guys are seriously losing your minds , so I 'm calling it a , ah , a ... a spaceship ! You seriously think we 're going to send it to Earth ? ''   `` Sir ! ''   `` Sir ! ''   `` ... .this is n't a spaceship . ''   `` You 're not serious ? ! What are you talking about ? ''   `` This is a spaceship ! Yes , it 's a spaceship . A spaceship ! A spaceship ! ''   `` This is not a spaceship ! This is a spaceship , not a spaceship ! ''   Both men turned and looked
It was n't a particularly dangerous thing . People were quite content with their lives , their emotions on their shoulders . Some were not , yet some were not . Many had to endure a lifetime of isolation to achieve whatever they wanted . But the most dangerous thing was that most all others were unable to live a good life for themselves .   The first few years were quite different than most . They felt like a kid 's toys , and the world seemed to be taking a rather deep turn . It was , however , a great achievement . Once everyone was happy , they could feel happy again . The world seemed to find so much joy in what they did .   It did n't take long for the people who would n't be able to feel happy to have their happiness back . A single person had achieved more than just happiness to be happy . It was a fascinating world .   It was the beginning of their own personal depression . Despite their struggles , they ultimately managed to achieve their own happiness . They could n't feel anything else .   They did n't have to endure much suffering . They could just enjoy and feel it again .
`` Well , sir , '' Doctor Crenshaw said , `` There 's really no such thing as God . In fact , there are plenty of other things as well . I do n't think we can ask who they are , but there 's definitely no afterlife for me . I mean , I guess those who are n't eternal are either created by another or destroyed by them , or are stuck in limbo until they find heaven or something like that . ''   I nodded .   `` So , what is there to be waiting for ? '' I asked .   `` Umm , you get to choose . ''   I sighed . `` Well , that 's quite a bit of a stretch , in a sense . I mean , everything else does n't really exist . Why should n't it ? It 's just sort of meaningless when you 're dead , and if you decide to meet another person , it 's possible . But there seems to be some sort of ... sort of *thing* , or sort of ... 'thing ' that decides what 's right . ''   `` ... I 'm dead ? '' I asked , in concern .   `` Well , sir . There will be no change . You 'll have to either come with some friends or someone to pick you up . See you on the other side . I do n't see you on the other side . I was thinking you 'd be a bit more open . ''   `` Wait , wait ... ''   `` Ummm , I suppose you 'll meet someone you know . You 'll probably meet someone you meet , and you 'll be able to start a family , and you 'll be able to move to a bigger place . ''   `` What about me ? ''   `` Well , the time you were dead , the people you were with were a bit less open . When you were alive , the people who were with you were also getting more open . In fact , I 'd even meet you with more people . That 's what you 'll get to choose , after all . ''   `` Wow , '' I said . `` I hope it 's worth it . ''
An old man came through my front door . He was dressed in a tight grey suit with a buttoned shirt , and sunglasses . A cane was in his hand . He had a black cane .   `` Hey ! Where are you ? ''   I opened the door and walked into the house , taking the cane from his hand . The figure stood there , in front of a large garden in the backyard . `` Is that you ? ''   He looked at me , and pointed it at the man who gave it the cane . `` You came . You came . You came until I was unable to take you back into my world . You came until I was unable to take you at will . You came until I was unable to take you away from your world . You came until I was unable to take you away from the world . You came until I was unable to take you back to my world . ''   My eyes widened as I realized the man was saying the same thing . `` Do you want me to tell you about the world ? ''   The figure spoke again and said , `` It is the world of cats and dogs . I . have . been . in . the world . ''   I stood there for a while . `` This is only a minute , '' I said .   The old man sighed . `` I think we need to talk . Make it quick . ''   I waited and waited for the old man to speak again , but after a few minutes he said , `` Okay , I . do . know . why . ''   I stood there for a while , contemplating what I had just done , but a few minutes went by . `` I ... I think you ... I think you need to leave . ''   The man replied , `` Yes , yes . I can get out of here . But I can not leave . ''   I pulled out my pocket knife and began to make my way toward the door .   `` I trust you ? ''   The man said , `` Yes . ''   `` Why ? '' I asked .   The man said , `` Because I am the cat who walks in front of you . The one who leaves the Garden of Cats and dogs . ''   I looked at the small table in front of me , and started scratching at it . A couple of cats came running forward to help me out .   `` Hey , '' the man said , `` Could we talk ? ''   The tall creature in the orange suit stood there , mouth agape . `` I like to talk to cats and dogs . ''   I jumped into action . `` What ? ''   The old man leaned in and whispered into my ear , `` I had this wonderful thing called a 'bird ' . I liked to call it wings , but when I fly , it is the only thing I can think about . I would give it wings if it were the size of my head . '' His eyes widened in sudden shock , `` Wait , wait ! What ? ''   `` You ... do n't understand . ''   The man looked at me , and said , `` Do not understand ? ''   The cat flew away and I stared at it , and realized it was almost 8 feet from me . It put its wings on my neck and started to go away with me .   I thought about it a minute . `` How are you doing this ? How are you going to get out of here ? ''   The old man did not respond , nor do I think anyone ever will . He simply did not answer . He simply walked towards the door and opened the door .   I saw the man outside my house . He was wearing the same grey suit , and sunglasses . A cane was in his hand . He had a black cane .   It was n't until I arrived home that I realized the old man was right . I walked toward my door and opened it .
My Dear Mrs. Mary Hartman ,   I love each day of your life . One day , I will take a walk through the woods , and you may come back to me and tell me that you are sorry and wish to know why . I will tell you why you cried that night , and I will tell you why I spent the last hour living myself . You will understand that I missed the last few hours of your life , and that I miss how you laughed . I miss how your hands are so soft and so soft and so soft . I miss how you would never let go of my arms in your wake . You would never let go of my legs . I miss how you would never let go of my legs . I miss how you would never let go of my arms in your wake . You would never let go of my feet in your wake . I miss how you would never let go of my arms in your wake . I miss how I would never let go of my legs in your wake .   Yours sincerely   Sarah Hartman  
For a moment , I thought I was dreaming . I could feel your tears , my body vibrating in anticipation as you kissed me , and your voice , your voice , echoed with excitement .   Then , the truth hit me . Those were the same exact words . `` Sleep , honey . ''   I woke up in a cold sweat . Shocked , I went to my bathroom to brush my face . I 'm not sure how to describe what happened . Then , I noticed my phone had disappeared , replaced with the image of a picture of a photo of a man and child .   I ran to the living room and picked it up , remembering that I had dropped the phone as soon as I realized that I missed my phone .   Then , I remembered that I had pushed the button on my phone for my girlfriend , and she had replied .   `` I 'm sorry , '' said her voice in a husk .   I put it down on the couch . But , as I was about to put it down , my phone began to ring . I opened it up and saw a message from my secretary .   `` Are you alright , honey ? ''   The voice answered . `` Yes , I 'm fine . ''   I 'm still confused , but I opened the message . `` I 'm sorry . You 're not the man I remembered . ''   `` I 'm sorry , '' the voice replied . `` That 's all . ''   I hung up the phone . Feeling a bit better , I made sure I got dressed . The last thing I saw before dropping my phone was a picture of a woman and child .
One final look at the destruction that was n't even *existent* . One final look at the human race .   It was n't always like this . In the beginning , people were more innocent than they 'd ever been . Why did it have to hurt like this ? There 'd been no way to stop it . The humans had been trying to protect themselves .   That 's how it got on the news : the global warming project had been approved . However , it needed to be implemented in the coming months . People found themselves in the dark , feeling as if they had been swept away by a storm . No one prepared anything but to endure a cold winter .   But now , they had to live . One cold winter , they all lived together . In solitude , they sat under the tree and watched the world burn .
He stood at the precipice of the molten obsidian sea , gazing at the shining lights of the city below .   He pulled the pin on his mask , gently . His blade trailed the edge of the obsidian blade , still hidden inside . He wiped his hands on his gloves before continuing on his way .   *How do I prevent myself from doing this ? You know what happens when you take the blame . *   He reached out to touch the edge of the obsidian blade , not noticing the red , bloody mass below him . He had n't expected something like this , after all .   *You should 've gone for a gungan*   He was right . The blacksmiths had taken the bait . And their bodies were soon covered in blood .   The killer sighed inwardly , turning about to face him .   His mask was too soft to be seen .   *You 're right . I 'm right . *   A flash of silver and a blade-toed light filled the distance .   He watched in horror as the blade-toed blade plunged through the air . He dropped to his knees , blood trailing behind him .   *I will not do this* , he thought .
I 'd been sitting down for a moment for him when a man walked up to me . I could see that he was n't handsome , but he was short and a bit slimmer than me . I noticed when he started to move , as if to make small talk , but he hesitated before continuing .   `` Thanks for coming . I have something to take with me . ''   He stopped , staring down at a small silver coin that I 'd been holding in my hand . He did n't seem to mind , so I took it . He took a swig , then continued . `` I 'm offering you one pint of Whiskey and one shot of Jim Beam . Please , drink . ''   `` Thank you , sir . Can I go now ? ''   `` Of course , but I 'm not as busy as most people are . ''   `` Can I go now ? ''   `` I need to make sure you 're not being rude . It 's never my intention to serve you anywhere else around here . ''   I stared absently at the machine and then decided to take the shot . As he turned to leave , he walked over to me and asked , `` So ... how many times have I waited to get away with this ? ''   `` Oh , a thousand . ''   `` Well , maybe a thousand , if you want . ''   I left , turning back around to head back to the counter . I stared at the counter , watching as the man walked away . I turned back around to the barkeep and asked , `` How many times has it taken you to get away with this ? ''   The man shrugged , and said , `` I 've never done it before , but I 'm afraid that 's not the point . ''   I stared at the man for a second , then asked , `` Why ? It 's been 10 years already , right ? ''   The man shook his head , and said , `` Well , I have nothing in store for me here . I 'm only here to take a shot . ''   I looked at the man , then at the barkeep . He was still looking at me , then nodded .   `` So , what do you want to drink , dude ? ''
I sat across from her as the phone clattered to the floor .   `` Dude , what 's wrong ? What are you doing ? '' She was trembling , but not on any level as she was pacing in the living room .   I shrugged and tossed the phone aside , `` Dammit , I was just looking for some water . ''   He let out a groan and looked over , `` No , I 'm just being serious . You did n't get that . ''   `` Why would you ? '' She asked .   `` Hey , if you made fun of me , you know that I did n't have any friends ? '' I shrugged , `` Not after my uncle passed away . ''   `` He did n't deserve to die . '' She shook her head , `` He murdered a couple of people . ''   `` He did n't deserve to die . ''   `` Dude , why would you ? So why would you kill someone if you 're not a good person ? ''   `` Dude , why would you kill someone other than yourself and no one else ? ''   `` Dude , I 'm like , seriously , seriously , I 'm really worried about you . '' I sighed , `` I just wanted to bring you some water , okay ? ''   `` Whatever man , you have nothing . You 're happy here . '' She looked up with teary eyes , `` What 's wrong ? ''   `` It 's just ... I do n't know , I could n't really understand it , but I had a feeling something was off . '' I sat back down in the couch , grabbing a blanket and putting two on . I looked up at her , `` You 're going to get better when you get better , are n't you ? ''   She looked down at her hands , `` Yeah , yeah , I know , but I do n't know . I just ... I 'm scared about you . ''   I pulled out my phone and hit connect .   *Two more messages*   *One more message*   *Two more messages*   *Three more messages*   *The message has expired*   `` I 'm just so sorry man , I thought I used to love you , but I ca n't anymore . Please forgive me . '' I laid the phone down on the floor , still holding the blanket tightly .   *Two more messages*   *One more message*   *Two more messages*   I picked up my phone , `` Hello ? ''   `` Hey , umm , what 's wrong ? '' She looked up at me , `` What do you mean , you ca n't anymore ? Do you want to die ? '' She looked up at me , `` Dude , not yet . ''   I opened the app for her . The message had expired . I looked at the screen , `` What is this guy ? Are you serious ? ''   `` Man , it 's just , you have n't been dead for a long time , why are n't you doing anything ? '' She looked up at me , `` You never died . You did n't die . ''   `` Why would you ? I 'm sorry ! I-I hate you ! ''   `` You were the first person I ever met to date . '' She looked up at me , `` You did n't die . It was n't a mistake of that magnitude . You deserved better . ''   I picked up my phone again , `` What is this guy ? ''   `` What is this guy ? I-I ... I was just wondering ... How would you do that ? I could n't do it , I just did n't feel like it was right . ''   `` Okay , fine . Did you ever feel that way again ? ''   `` Yes . How many times is that going to take ? ''   `` You 're doing your best ? ''   `` That 's what I do , you 're becoming a better person . '' I looked over at her , `` I- I love you . '' I closed the app and handed it to her .   `` Goodbye . ''   I sat back and stared at my phone , `` Goodbye , man . ''
I still remember the day my power manifested . It was a Friday after school on a Saturday , but it was only a few hours later that it happened . I do n't get why the students did n't notice it before when I was walking in with them . I just could n't stop myself from following them , because the rest of the classroom was empty , except for one class in particular . A middle aged guy was staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face , followed by a middle aged man who looked almost like a normal person .   `` You 're late ! '' the middle aged man shouted .   I immediately turned around and headed to the back of the class . I felt like I had just walked through the classroom of some other dumb kid , and was walking towards them when I started to notice something on their faces .   `` Are you alright ? '' The elderly man again asked .   `` Yeah . I 'm fine ... '' I started to talk to the middle aged man . There was a pause .   `` Ah . Well , you saw something on them . Something that was important . You saw their faces . You did n't see what it meant . ''   `` What do you mean something important ? ''   `` They 're dead . We need your help . ''   `` Sir , I want a doctor . '' I said , hoping that my words would calm the man down . He did n't seem to give a damn .   `` No ! No ! Let me go ! '' He shouted , and looked up from where he stood . The middle kid was looking at him , and he was trying to hide his fear .   `` You do n't understand ! You need to help ! '' The middle kid exclaimed .   `` I 'm here ! I ... I just got here ! '' I said , trying to get my voice out .   `` They 're dead ... '' The middle kid said , and looked up into my eyes .   `` Oh my god ! I 'm not dead ! '' I cried , and looked down at my feet . They were gone , but the one that I was staring at was now standing on the ground and staring at me . The little man on the ground looked me up and down . He started to scream .   `` Who are you ? '' I demanded .   `` Please ! I am nothing ! Let me go ! '' The man said , putting his hands over his eyes .   I felt like I was walking through some sort of super strong force . I felt like my face was being sucked into a big black hole ! I screamed , but it was n't any different from the screams I remember . I started to run , but never stopped . I wanted to run , but I just could n't stop myself . I started to feel ... like I was being sucked into a giant black hole .   Suddenly , a voice in my head growled , `` Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha '' . I started to cry , but that did n't stop me . I felt like I was being sucked into a giant black hole . I stopped screaming , and looked around . I saw the middle kid sitting in the corner of the classroom with his eyes closed tightly .   `` Please ... '' I said . I could clearly see the fear in his face , and I could n't stop myself from crying . Suddenly , I heard a loud bang . I felt pain , and all I could do to help was wipe my face off . I turned my head to look at the man , and saw something in his eyes . I felt the blood stain on my face and I began to cry as well .   I stopped crying , and looked on to the other man with his eyes closed tightly , and saw nothing . I saw nothing . I ran out of the class , and got up only to find myself running towards a massive black hole . I started to run for the exit , but I was too late . I ran for what felt like an eternity , until I could n't see anything anymore .
`` Yo , hey ! Hey ! Holy shit , dude man , what the fuck ! What 's wrong with this shit ? ''   `` Yeah , I ... ''   `` You do n't know what 's wrong with this shit . We 're in an office , man . I work here , you have n't even heard of us . ''   `` What 's wrong with THIS shit ? Dude , you 're in my office for five minutes and you just *spoke up* talking to me ! ''   `` What ? No , man , you 're on our side . I 'm in your office , *you* have n't even said anything ! ''   `` Listen , I do n't know what the fuck is going on , just ... ''   `` I 'm just saying that , dude . We 're in a parking lot , and you 're in your office . You 're in my office for five minutes and we 're not here for five minutes . Are we ? ''   `` Yeah . I think I mean , dude . I do n't know what 's going on about this shit . But that does n't mean you ca n't do any good with everything , man . ''   `` Are you telling me I 'm hallucinating ? ''   `` No , dude ! That does n't mean we ca n't do anything good with everything . You 'll never graduate from college , and do n't get any job , and nothing will ever come of that . But that does n't mean nobody will ever know . And besides , because no one will ever know , I know how it is . ''   `` I do n't know what to say . ''  � Dude , it 's alright . I 'm starting over . It 's nothing personal . But I 'm starting over . ''   `` What ? ''   `` You do n't have to be kidding me ! Just ... ''   `` I 'm just saying that , dude . We 're in a parking lot , and we 're not here for five minutes and you 're just saying that , dude . Is that how it works ? ''   `` Well ... yeah ... ''   `` Fuck yeah , I 'm telling you . I 'm telling you . ''   `` I do n't know what 'd be the easiest way to go about it . I guess this is a big misunderstanding . ''   `` But I 'm in your office for five minutes and we 're not here for five minutes . ''   `` I 'm almost done with this . I 'm starting over . ''   `` Listen man ! We 're in an office , and you 're in my office for five minutes and you just ca n't do anything good with everything . You ca n't go out to the park , you 've got ta get ready for work , you have to do stuff that will work because you need to do stuff that will work because you need to do stuff for the rest of your life , and you 're not like ... ''   `` I 'm just saying that . I 'm talking about the fact that , man , what the fuck is going on ? ''   `` You 're telling me that , dude , I 'm hallucinating . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Man , you 're telling me that , man ! ''   `` Okay , okay . I 'm probably going to get fired today , okay ? ''   `` I 'm gon na kill you . You 're gon na die . I 'm gon na die . I 'm gon na kill you . ''   `` Are you fucking serious ? You 're telling me that , dude ! ''   `` Right . Okay . I 'm just saying that . That is really , really stupid stuff . ''   `` Dude ... ''   `` Shut up . ''   `` Dude , shut up . ''   `` Okay . I 'm telling you that . I 'm saying that . Keep telling me that . I 'm gon na kill you . ''   `` I ... ''   `` Shut up . ''   `` Okay .

`` My lord ... The fleet is in a condition . It has been attacked by a Sith ship . ''   `` We have no way of knowing what this force entails , Lord . ''   `` I have no way of knowing how this force can be possibly used to destroy us . ''   `` Perhaps , Lord , there is hope . ''   I was in the middle of a battle , when the Sith ship sunk into the planet of Darth Vader . I was thrown in battle with them , and the battle ended quickly .   It was at least twice as long as I had been in the battle , but that was all .   So , since you may be wondering , how did I manage to get out of the battle ?   I 'll give you one thing ; I have no idea why I did it .   It was because of my ability to escape his forces .   That is until the dark side broke within the fleet .   The Sith ship crashed into an escape pod , and I landed in an abandoned hangar , surrounded by hundreds of thousands of other Jedi .   `` Lord , I have no power to stop the Sith , but I shall gain by destroying your order . ''   Okay , I could go ask anyone in this galaxy , but ...   *Why did it have to be me ? *   Suddenly , a loud sound filled the hangar . The whole horde of other Jedi looked up , revealing themselves .   `` My lord , I have no power over their force . The force to destroy our planet can be used to destroy a large number of ships that move from a distance . ''   They all started to run towards me , trying to escape .   `` Why do n't you tell me why the force can be used to destroy us ? ''   `` I do n't ever want to hear the answer to that question . ''   `` Then ... ''   A few blaster pistols appeared in their hands , and pointed at me .

`` Hey , Ted , is it time for you to go out with your friends or something ? ''   Ted rolled his eyes . He hoped the guy would n't mind sharing his secret with Rob .   `` Just your luck , '' Ted replied , looking over at Rob 's shoulder .   `` Great , '' Rob said . Ted nodded and put his hand on Rob 's shoulder . `` Let 's see how long you can stay away from the place . ''   Ted looked down at the date on the date 's page . It was April 21st . At 5:44am EST , Rob would be on the way home from the office , so Ted would n't have to go around working on the day off and watching when he would go .   `` Wow , '' Ted said . `` I thought you did n't notice . ''   `` Why would I ? '' Rob asked . `` You 're too smart , you 're not even going to tell anyone . ''   `` I know , I 've tried , '' Ted said . `` But , you 're the best . ''   `` I do n't know about that , '' Rob said . `` I ca n't really be anyone 's friend . ''   Ted did n't answer . `` Do you remember that time you told us to try that ? ''   `` That would be the first time I did that , '' Rob said . `` I would n't actually know if I was special , all I knew was that I would n't have my friends to test me . ''   `` That 's very harsh , '' Ted said .   `` I thought you would be nice , '' Rob said . `` But think about this . That 's very harsh . ''   `` I thought you would be nice , '' Ted said .   `` We 'll still try , '' Rob responded .   Ted did n't answer . `` Ted , are you sure this is true ? ''   `` It is , '' Ted said . `` I 'm sure . You 'll keep it secret forever . ''   `` Ummm , '' Rob said . `` What else do we do ? ''   `` I have a very special secret , but your friends are never me . So , I 'll tell you what . Trust me . You could never know if there was anything special about you . ''   Ted nodded .   `` Ted ? '' Rob asked .   Ted nodded .   `` I tried that , '' Rob said .   `` Have you tried being special ? '' Ted asked . `` You are the greatest athlete in the world . You are the best president in history . You are the best basketball player in the world . You are the best basketball player in the world . You are the best president in the world . ''   `` I 'm sorry , '' Ted said .   `` I 'm sorry , '' Rob said . `` I 'm really really sorry . ''   Ted nodded .   It was n't long before he was walking back home . He stopped at the bank , looked at Rob and shook his head .   `` I 'll pull it off , '' Rob said . `` I promise I wo n't call the police . I swear . I promise . ''   `` Ted , '' Rob said . `` It 's okay . I know you do n't understand . It 's all over the news . ''   `` You are in danger , '' Ted said . `` You have made a mistake , Ted . Your friend is going to die soon because you have n't lied to Bob . ''   `` I wish I had lie , '' Rob said . He put his arm over Rob 's shoulder . `` Do n't worry about it . ''   `` I 'll give you all the money , '' Ted said . `` You could never tell anyone . ''   `` But I 'll keep it secret forever , '' Rob said .   Ted nodded .   `` If you do n't tell anybody , I can never say anything , '' Ted said .   `` Ted ! '' Rob shouted .   `` But I 'll keep it secret forever , '' and he did .  
There were two accounts on the computer , one on one page titled `` One Day : One Day '' and the other on the other page titled `` One day '' . I never really knew why , but I was always curious regarding which of these accounts was which .   But then I remember that I had been dating a girl for seven years before the incident . I was dating her for at least two years straight , and I had never met her before . But she wore a red blouse , black skirt , and black top button undone in a way that made me anxious to meet her . And in her hand was a black business card , and I remember seeing her in a black suit .   And in her left hand was a black business card and there was black business card attached to it , although I could n't quite grasp it .   I remember that I had been on the wrong side of the world , and still the words `` One day '' were etched into my mind . I remember how she had described me , and how I was such a shame , and how I loved her . I remember being in love with her , and how her soft pale skin reminded me of a soft , warm summer day .   But then I remember that the first time she had walked into the room , I had looked down at the beautiful card and asked her , `` Does your name matter ? ''   I had always thought that she was a very pretty girl , and the way she looked at me worried me . But maybe today was not so bad .   The next day , I sat on the couch , and watched her go about her day .   Then there was a knock on the door , and I jumped up . Someone had entered the living room and was yelling , `` Wake up ! ''   I looked at the door and saw my wife standing on the couch , dressed in a black business suit . As the man approached her , I saw that he was wearing a black business card that had a white business card underneath it , and on it was a black business card that read , `` One Day : One Day '' .   So I turned around to look at her . `` WHAT THE FUCK ? ''   There was a knock on the house door , and I jumped up . `` I ca n't believe you ! ''   That was the moment that I realized that I was still alive . And I had never met her before .
They called it the death of humanity . As far as the research could tell , it was an uneventful death .   Many people thought it could be anything other than a slow , slow death , like a slow death , but no one really thought what would happen .   The news outlets reported that the cause of death was in the millions . Hundreds of thousands and thousands of people died . Death victims . Some were in homes , others died in stores . Others killed themselves inside of vehicles , others just stared at the ceiling , waiting for a chance to strike .   No one knew what was happening , but it seemed that humanity might have the opportunity to end it all just by leaving a mark on the world . Nothing could change that .   After nearly an hour the death toll dropped from around 50,000 to around 700,000 .   It became apparent as the world leaders were discussing the ramifications of the deaths , most of them were just in shock . Most had just begun to look at the mark on the world , others did n't realize they were the only one to notice , even those that did did n't really care .   Now , as every single figure on the planet seems to be turning a blind eye to the death toll , a few people are feeling very uneasy . They might be the only people that have noticed .   It seems someone has decided to check it out . They tried to be quick , but were barely made out . The person who sees it might be the only thing that ca n't change the world .   If anyone chooses to be the first to notice the mark , just let it go .
It all started just so people thought . Some thought it was funny . Some thought it was all a joke . About 3 minutes after we got here , the doorbell rang .   I walked into the next room . `` What would you like to grab for tea ? '' , was the greeting I received .   My wife answered . `` What was that ? ''   `` I uh ... This is my son 's room '' , I could n't understand how much that meant .   `` Mmm ... Yes . Have a seat . ''   I sat down and ordered my tea .  ___________________________________________   5 minutes after we got here , the doorbell rang .   The child glanced at me .   `` There 's a man at the gate . ''   `` Who is he ? ''   `` I do n't know . He came in ''   I could sympathize with the man . I told him that I found my son and that I needed to contact him early .   `` Please wait . ''   `` No choice '' , I said .  ____________________________________________   10 minutes after we got here , the doorbell rang .   My wife answered . `` Thank you . I think we should go now . ''   `` Why not ? Now ? ''   `` I 'm just trying to help you understand that something is wrong . ''   I could tell that she was becoming scared of me . I smiled . `` Just tell me what 's going on . ''   `` He came in with a gun '' at this exact moment , I knew that the man knew what was going on .  ____________________________________________   11 minutes after we got here , the doorbell rang .   As I walked into my son 's room , I heard a voice .   `` Wake him up ''   My wife turned on the TV to see him being restrained . `` Sir , we 're very sorry to interrupt your son 's bedtime story , but his son just saved him . Who are you ? ''   My wife turned from the television . `` Yes , it 's me . I 'll be looking for your son . He was in the hospital after an accident . ''   The little kid smiled . `` Thanks . Is that okay ? ''   `` No . Do n't worry son , he 's fine . ''  _____________________________________________   18 minutes after we got here , the doorbell rang again .   My wife looked at me .   `` Good luck with that '' .  ____________________________________________   16 minutes after we got home , my husband greeted me .   `` He lost consciousness recently '' .   `` It 's quite alright , just make sure he 's okay . ''   `` Thank you . ''   I began my daily routine . I grabbed my children 's favorite toy and set them on their bed . I went to the kitchen to try and keep the toys company while putting them on . As I prepared the cereal , I heard a faint noise . I turned around and saw a man in a dark suit , walking towards me .   `` You saved him . ''   I was shocked at what I just heard . People were whispering in my life .   `` It 's a pity you have to die . '' The man spoke softly .   `` I ca n't believe you have never been so happy . ''   `` You said your son would die today . ''
`` Uhhh Rick , we know you 've been to some good places . You might not be in good shape , but we think you 've finally shown maturity , '' the interviewer said , looking around at all the other applicants that had appeared and found themselves in front of him . `` How could you possibly be qualified for a job ? ''   Rick 's jaw dropped , `` You could have been born an amazing baby . But that was the kind of news that many people would have believed . My brother was like , a really great shot at what we did . He was like , the star of the ball . You know , he was really great at his stuff . ''   The interviewer smiled , `` That is a shame , we have n't had a single interview since he was a little girl . ''   Rick fell to his knees in disbelief , `` Do you mean that he was great ? ''   The interviewer smiled , and said , `` he spent all his time doing nothing to help people . He would just go outside and eat whatever he could to build a nice house out of trash . I just know that you 've been making all sorts of connections with him . Does he have a girlfriend ? '' 
`` Your hand , sir . ''   Tom gave his left hand a practiced shrug .   `` It 's a special hand . ''   `` *WHAT* ? '' The driver barked . `` You have no idea *what* I 've been doing for the past week . ''   Tom frowned . `` I do n't think you understand . You are in a terrible place ; a terrible place . ''   The driver nodded . `` Sometimes , '' he said , `` I think I actually know that I 've been doing this for the last month . ''   `` There are many things you do n't understand . Most people are confused about the end result of their life ; they are wondering when they will end up in heaven . ''   `` Yes , '' Tom said . `` There are many things *I* wo n't understand . ''   And now with that thought , Tom walked out of the car and down the sidewalk at the end of the street , right now .
I woke up to the sound of shattering glass as I slammed my fist on the side of the building . I kicked a chair right into it as it fell into the street . The floorboards creaked beneath my feet , and the sounds of shards falling to the floor flooded the room . I picked up the floorboard and threw it against the wall , shattering it in half . I looked in the mirror to see what had happened , and saw a scar on my forehead . I walked back to bed and went to work .   *****  I woke up on my own again . I opened the drawer of my desk , pulling out a small box , and opened it . Inside , lay a single golden button . Inside , sat a single red pill bottle , with an insignia . At the bottom was an explanation .   *****  It had been twenty five years since I had opened the time machine . Twenty five years since the time travel had occurred . Twenty five thousand years since I had pushed the button on the wrong side of the gun , and that same red pill bottle had been thrown into the street a hundred times before , and that same red pill bottle was thrown into the street twenty times before .   *****  I pulled the trigger . My brain was racing . Was I really this far back ? I decided to pull a trigger . I moved back to my desk and looked at the clock . It read 9:23AM . I quickly fired up the time machine , and pulled a few pieces of paper out of my suit pocket . I read the message that had been attached to the case .   *Why did you press that button ? *   *****  I quickly ran out of ammo . I looked down the street and realized I had only ten bullets left . I flipped the lamp on and ran back in the building . I yelled out as I ran into the building , `` Did you do that ? '' As I reached the exit , the door swung open . As I climbed down , I saw a man with a bomb strapped to his head . I saw him fall to his knees and began to cry .   *****  I pulled out the bomb , and pulled the trigger . As he got to his knees , I pulled the trigger .   *****  I killed him .
He was looking around nervously , his hand held up from behind a shelf , looking in front of the only other place on the shelves in the restaurant that had the best view of his place . He looked down at the glass , and as the eyes of the young couple went wide he saw his mouth move and he closed it .   It had been a long night , and he had walked around the restaurant looking for his usual spot . The couple had walked past a broken window and were looking at a beautiful , but neglected house on a side street with broken light from somewhere around the city . He turned he corner , and was about to take another look , when he saw an old man in a black suit . He blinked and glanced at the waiter but found himself stuck , frozen , staring at the man whom he had always hoped to be his friend .   He looked at the man again , and saw a tear forming on his cheek , and just before he could look away he heard the waiter turn around and put on a red light . A flash of bright light and everything went dark .  
`` You will know why I am here . '' I managed to stutter through my tears as I saw the future dictator start to speak .   `` Me . '' He said suddenly before my vision abruptly cleared . `` I represent no one . I have done good things with your kind and your people . I have brought prosperity into the world . ''   `` I see . '' I managed to stammer . `` You have changed . ''   The man lifted his hand and sat down across from me , `` I can not change if you will trust me . ''   `` Are you going to tell me why I have done good ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Are you going to write a book about me , or something ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Are you going to write a novel about me , or is it about what I have done ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Is that what you will do ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Are you going to tell me why you have done good things with your kind and your people ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Are you going to tell me why you have done good things with your people ?

I looked down at my computer , which was now blinking . I could n't believe what I saw . Where the hell was I ? There was a strange looking man holding a gun and pointing it at me .   `` You 'll pay for something . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Murder . You will pay for anything you can . ''   `` What does that even mean ? ''   `` That you will pay for someone else 's murder , '' the man said . `` I must ask , how do you know this ? ''   `` I killed a man . Like many people . ''   `` What ? ''   `` But he knew about this person 's murder . ''   `` Maybe he did n't . ''   `` Then why are you killing someone , then ? ''   `` Because you killed the person who 's done this . ''   `` Oh . Are you real ? ! ''   `` No . I am . ''   He seemed to point at me . Then again , the gun was now pointing at me .   `` Damn . What the f ... ''   `` You 're dead . You 're sorry . You just killed the person who 's done this . ''   In a blur , the man grabbed me by the collar , and dragged me out of the building .
`` Why are you doing this again ? ''   Her eyes stared right into mine as she said , `` Just doing it again today . Just just make up some excuse to make sure I do n't hit my head enough . ''   I started to cry , but my tears stopped . She was still there . I opened my mouth to ask what happened about the book , but all that came out was a clap . I looked around ; I noticed the police had already had their van . The only thing that made sense was why she was holding the book . `` I have to do it again.. ''   `` No ! Do n't do it again . No ! Do n't ! You have to run ! YOU MUST BE ALIVE ! ''   `` It 's not right ! You are n't going to get away with this ! I am here for you ! ''   She looked at everything in front of her . All the books , all the books , all the stories . Then she got up , grabbed the book , and walked out . I knew I was n't going to survive , but I had to keep running .   I got out of the police car , and ran to the nearest town to escape from the police . If I was n't going to die in the fight , then I was going to die in the death of someone . I ran for miles to make it to my house . It was getting more and more crowded and I figured I was going to die in the fight that was going to be my last fight on my life .   I heard footsteps approaching . I turned to look , but there was an officer holding a gun . I jumped out of the car and ran to him . `` Hey Officer ! It 's me ! '' I yelled .   He looked at me confused . `` Are you okay ? ''   `` How did you know ? '' I asked him .   `` You 're going to die too . ''   I think I remember reading about the time the man came back from the burning house , and the officer just ran off . I remember the next day , I went to my friends house and saw him in his car . He was dressed in a military fatigues , looking like the type of Colonel he is today . He was wearing a uniform my friend had never seen before . I just looked at him , confusion creeping up on me .   `` Was he dead ? '' I asked .   `` It 's right here . ''   `` You ca n't be dead.. I saw him . ''   `` I know . ''   `` Do you think you can do this ? ''   `` Yeah , but I ca n't talk to you right now . ''   `` You sure you do n't want to talk to me ? You need to talk to me , stop trying to make yourself understand right now . ''   `` Yeah , that 's brilliant . ''   `` You need to go back to living on Earth . You need to see it . Everyone , everyone , needs to see it . This whole world is going to be destroyed . ''   `` What ? ! What do you mean ? ! Do you know what happened to the book ? ! ''   `` It was n't , it was n't supposed to be there ! ''   `` Who are you ? ! Who are you ? ! ''   `` I 'm you . You 're the author . Please , go back to being human , okay ? This is all too much ! ''   `` I-i-i ca n't ! I ca n't ! I 'm okay ! I 'm still breathing ! I think I died ! I just need to go back to being human ! Please ! I ca n't ! ''   `` Please . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . ''   `` You 're missing this . ''   `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` Please . I 'm so sorry . ''   I began sobbing again .   `` Please , just die . ''   `` We-we can save you . Please just do n't . ''   `` No . Do n't you have to die already ? This is too much . Please , just stay and die .   `` Please . Please . Please . ''   The officer walked out of the vehicle for a few seconds , and then he pulled out the gun and shot me in the forehead . I fell
`` What are you doing here ? ? ! ''   `` I just ... I just want to lay down and rest . The city ... ''  `` The city is not safe . ''  `` But , they are n't safe in here . They have all the ... . weapons ... . ''  `` What does this mean ? ! ''  `` They have a lot of weapons , yes . They do n't have guns ! They have guns ! ''  `` What do you mean ? !

It had been ten thousand years since the world had ended and the world was dying . So many , too many to count . As I stood here , watching the water swirl around my feet , I saw the sky . I saw the beautiful blue-green , the yellow and orange waves , the ones from years past , the ones from the future , the ones from the past . I watched the water livid around me , the water boiling .   But I did not . I saw the end .   I felt the impact of the impact . I stepped back , letting the water rush after me . The ship shot past me , slowly , with the water coming from beneath us . But not before we hit the ground , and the water froze . It spread and spread , and I watched it spread .   From then on , the world was not a bright place . No , it was n't what it should be . It was a dark place with empty space , with no lights nor people . When the light got too bright , it spread . And I saw it spread .   Then , with a tiny splash , we were on the shore . The waves crashed against the waves . I felt it hit me , and I watched as it spread .   It spread as fast as a tsunami , and it spread with a thunderous echo . And I watched as it spread .   Suddenly I heard a voice . My heart skipped a beat , and I turned around and saw a girl . She was just as beautiful as I remembered her . Her hair was fair and pale , and her skin was a gold shade of blue . She had black hair , and fair skin . She was pretty , and her complexion was a deep , red color . She was crying and shouting , and running away .   I watched her walk away , and as I watched her , I saw her reach out , and I felt her touch my arms . She seemed concerned . And I watched as she pointed her finger into my eyes with a gentle smile . She looked me in the eyes . I smiled back and said , `` I love you , '' and she turned to run .   I smiled back , and closed my eyes .   One last time , I would see her again .
`` *Two women in a room , identical to the one opposite* ''   The white haired woman in the corner of the room waved an eyebrow at the television screen .   `` Is the ... that a gay marriage thing ? ''   `` Yep . It 's about as good as anyone believes , and what I 'm about to say is , you know , it 's not like they have to work at all . They can probably get together in a week , but that does n't mean they have to work at all . ''   `` I think it 's best if I say it in words ... ''   `` I think *I* would . ''   She put a hand to her forehead . `` Do you think it 's better if I say it in words ... ''   `` Yeah . ''   The man in the corner stared blankly at the screen . `` I think you 're going to think well . But you do n't get it . I was born blind , and I never had a loving wife . If you 're going to say this , *do* it so bluntly . I 've never been a very good person . ''   `` *That's* why I am doing this . ''   `` *I* am . That 's why if you say it in words , *that 's* that no one will ever know that you 're my brother . '' Her hands began to tremble , causing the man in the corner to drop his head . He tried to turn from the screen , but lost sight of the woman in the corner as she sat with him .   `` What 's your name ? ''   `` I 'm Jessica ''   `` You are ? ''   `` Yeah , I 'm ... I ... ''   `` We 'll see what you 'd call us . '' 
The alien ships landed on Earth on Friday and we began to panic . We had to fight them . We had to win .   I could n't even begin to focus . I was n't sure how long I wanted to fight them , but it was n't long before they returned .   They had taken multiple states and were starting to take over entire states , with the exception of this one state , in the northeast , in the north . They had taken over many cities , but they had only just begun to take over everyone in this whole world .   The news of my success started , claiming that the aliens had invaded on Sunday , and that all those countries were wiped out . I immediately knew that I had to face this . I did n't know how many people that had been in this world were dead .   I began sobbing as I was dragged out of my house . I was called into the hospital and told to calm down . I was so worried that I thought I could n't breathe . I never even felt anything .   I finally tried to cry as the doctors came in and told me that I was going to die . I did n't know if this would be the end for me or if I would have enough time to truly rest .   I opened my eyes and was greeted by bright lights that I had never seen before .   A man entered out of nowhere and greeted me with a smile and a chuckle . It sent chills through my stomach since I had never seen him before . I recognized him .   He said that we would win by standing for no reason other than the war .   I remembered that I had n't even heard a word from him before the announcement was made , but I was so confused that I did n't even think about it until the crowd began to disperse .   The strange man said that the aliens decided that humans were better off left alone . That humanity needs to fight better than before .   The entire world was looking at me puzzled . Nobody knew who I was or what I wanted . We simply stared at each other for what seemed like forever before the crowd erupted in cheering and cheering .   I was still confused . I did n't realize for what seemed like forever that I had been walking because I was the only one in this vast , empty world I had known .
“ What the fuck ! ” I yell as I sprinted down the street . “ What ? ! ”   I stop in the middle of the street and look for him . As I look around , I make out a small framed photo of him standing next to a body lying on the ground .   “ Oh my god ! ! ” I shout with panic . “ Holy shit ! ” I run back home and drop on my couch , staring at the photo . I look back up and notice that my dog has fallen asleep . When I look back up , I see the photo is gone .   “ I got you this ! ” I yell angrily , laughing to myself .   I look over and notice a young man standing next to a body lying on the ground .   “ Oh my god ! ! ! ” I yell as I sprint up the street , kicking the remains of my dog off the ground .   I look at my dog and see I got ta get back home .   edit : grammar
`` What am I ... what am I ... what am I , '' he struggled with the words .   `` No , '' she said in a calm , soothing voice . `` It was the test they gave you . Your best shot at redemption . '' She strode over to the counter in the corner and took a pair of magnifying glasses off of the desk . `` Now , I just need a ... '' she trailed off , her voice wavering .   `` A bottle of wine ? '' he looked at her , but no more than thirty feet away from the counter .   `` Yes . You asked for a bottle of wine . Now that you asked you were going to do well , you got to do better . Now ... now you ... ''   She put the glasses back on the counter . Her eyes focused on her surroundings .   `` No ... no . You wanted something better , '' her voice cracked .   He took two cautious steps forward . She took one more , too . She took one more , too . His eyes focused on the glass she had given him .   `` I wanted something better . Please , do n't do it . I just need a ... what am I ... what are I , '' he tried to cry out . Only a brief moment later , she burst into tears .   She grabbed his hand and squeezed his . He did n't feel anything , but her face changed one last time .   `` You did good , '' she offered as she went on , `` You made the right choice . I am so proud of you . ''   `` I love you too , '' he whispered .  
I did it . I did it so suddenly that I could n't breathe . I 've never felt this way before when I was just a child . How could I blame myself for making it this far ? She has a smile on her face , her eyes still locked on mine .   `` I 'm not going to hurt you again , '' I say , `` I 'm not going to be an evil person anymore . ''   She laughs slightly , almost as if in the hope that she might break her concentration .   `` Well , they said you 'll be a hero soon , '' she says , her smile now wide and full . `` I thought I could do better . ''   `` But why would *I* ? , '' I say . `` Why would you have to make that choice ? '' No , it 's been like this for a long time . It changes everything . The world , the world we live in . Every aspect of us . Everything you see and touch . Everything we love and listen to . Anything you 've ever done . All your mistakes . All your faults . All your faults .   `` Well , I 've wanted to see you suffer like this for a long time , but I ca n't do that anymore . I ca n't save you from yourself anymore . I 've got to be a terrible person now . You know that ? ''   Her smile widens , even though she is afraid of what will come next .   `` No . I want you to look me in the eye . I love you . I know you 're in a bad place now , and it 's time for you to stop hurting . ''   I see a tear drop to my face .   `` I love you too , sweetheart , '' I tell her . `` You 're the one who made me do what I want . Will you stop hurting us ? ''   `` No no . I can help you . ''   I ca n't help myself . This has never happened to me before . It 's not supposed to , but I must fix this one .   `` You know , I 've always wanted to be a good person with you , sweetheart , but I just ca n't do that anymore . ''   The smile fades away .   `` Just make it worth it , okay ? '' she adds , her voice trembling .   I look away . I 'm just starting to walk away from the scene .   My heart sinks and I can feel myself taking on an almost malicious nature .   `` I just ... I 'm sorry . ''   She takes the moment to see the emotion in my eyes . It 's a look I have n't seen before . It 's full of longing and hate looking back at me .   `` Do it , sweetheart . ''   My eyes fill with tears .   `` I 'm sorry , '' she replies , her voice still dry . `` I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . ''   That is my last goodbye .   `` I love you , sweetheart ... . ''  
* '' Huh , Fred ? `` *   `` I do n't think you 've got it , Michael . It 's just ... we 've got to figure out what it was . ''   * '' Huh , Fred . Are… are you sure you 're getting this right , Michael ? Do you know what I 'm talking about ? `` *   `` Fred , there 's a reason you 're here , Michael . We can figure that out . You can stop by the library and watch 'The Interview ' by Freddy Krueger . We can put it out there , okay ? ''   * '' Sure . Maybe . `` *   `` So you just think we know what it was , Michael ? ''   * '' Fred . You know what , man . Yeah . It was *just* a stupid idea . I just ... I just wanted to make sure it 's OK . ''   * '' Fred , if you do n't stop by my library , I 'm sure you 'll know that by now . See you tomorrow , Michael . `` *   `` Oh , my God ... it really is *kidding*. ``   ***   As the police started getting suspicious of Freddy Krueger , the police officer pulled up to the address to his house .   `` Good evening , officer . This is Mr. Michael Douglas . This is Mr. Douglas ! ''   Mrs. Douglas stepped into the house , glancing at the body that was lying in the bed .   `` What do you think your brother is doing ? ''   `` Eh . Maybe he 's just getting to his job , Mr. Douglas . Maybe it 's a hallucination . ''   Mrs. Douglas looked around , searching for Mr. Douglas .   `` That sounds like a robbery , ma'am . '' She put a hand on her shoulder . `` Come on , it 's already been resolved . ''   With a sigh , she led him to the living room . She opened the door and took out a coffee pot and sipped it .   `` So , uh , what 's your brother doing at his job interview today ? ''   `` He 's just getting into his school , Michael . ''

*You are on the wrong side of town . *    *Do you like the sunset that comes from the city 's highest tower ? Do you like the feeling of the air drifting through you one by one ? *     *What 's this thing about the sky , Doctor ? Do you like the look on the face of the sky ? *     *Do you like the sun ? Do you like the look of the world beneath your feet ? *     *You have made an amazing one for yourself , Doctor . You were the one to start anew . *    *As it were , I can not do so much as take this opportunity , but I can put to good use a friend . *     *I can make it my duty to make it a bit better , Doctor . Do you like it ? *     *Is n't that a lovely thing to do ? *     *I wish , Doctor . Now go . *      Her hand gently caressed the bedside of Dr. M. Steel . Her face was expressionless . Not like the face she used to be in , or in a position that could be considered an expressionless mask . She was simply different in a way that had only recently come into being . Her eyes were bright blue , and she had a large smile on her face .     Doctor M. Steel smiled as he slowly walked over and wrapped the strap that had been around her neck to tight . He pulled her out of the ward , and walked back in to open the door to her room .      She sat on the bed , her blue dress stretching to her breasts . A man in the corner appeared with a clipboard and clipboard . He opened the clipboard again , and began writing down in a clipboard .      The man looked up at Dr. Steel .       `` So , Doctor , what brings you here today ? ''      `` My husband 's diagnosed with a rare side of leukemia . '' The man said , his voice growing colder .       `` Oh is that so ? ''      `` It 's just , you know , he 's been a really successful actress , and he 's doing just fine . ''       Dr. Steel sighed . `` So , when did you get this diagnosis ? ''      `` Well , he was on a particularly good side of town , and he started making dinner . ''      Dr. Steel smiled . `` Do you think we can reach the bottom of this ? The roof can provide the roof with a small fire ? I mean , I have n't made it to the top , but I 'm sure there is a decent shelter out in the city at least . ''      Dr. Steel leaned closer to her , his face becoming sternder . `` Do you think you can do better ? You have a family ! ''      `` He 's been kindest , Doctor . ''      `` So , what makes you think he 's kindest ? ''      `` I do n't want to spoil it , honestly , '' Dr. Steel said , his voice going hoarse . `` But can you give him some advice ? ''      Dr. Steel raised an eyebrow . `` I do n't think he would do anything to ruin the situation if it were n't for me . I know that he 's had so many failures . But I think he 's going to be doing alright . ''      The man looked at Dr. Steel . His face seemed hollow . `` I think we can find a way to do that . He has been acting really well in a lot of ways . I think he 'll get better . ''       Dr. Steel stood and walked over to Dr. Steel . `` The cancer is getting to him . He has n't aged a day since he hit puberty . ''      Dr. Steel looked at the man in the corner . 
He glanced at the young clerk down at the table . His eyes had gone over every detail of the person as she approached . It had been nearly two weeks since he 'd been here ; and now it was time for a long conversation . He wanted to say something , to say something to her , but his voice did n't seem to have the patience .   `` I 'm sure you 've heard of Jack from the gang . ''   Jack sat on the table , staring at the shopkeeper 's face . He turned over his hands , and then smiled .   `` He was a little bit wild , but good luck ! I 'll bring you whatever you need ! ''   Jack put his hands down and took a deep breath , as he exhaled . The shopkeeper 's laughter was gone . She was back .   It was over . Everything he said was true , and he knew it would be true . Jack had spoken to her , and had told her his tales of the gang . She was a friend , and he loved her from the moment he got here . She had grown up with the same friends , who seemed more like a family than a real friend . She would always leave the place , but he knew his family would always keep her company .   His smile turned into a smile , and they walked away .   Their meeting was over , and Jack stood up .   The cafe was dim , and Jack saw nothing at all . It was dark , and he smelled the same dirt . He walked by , and walked past the counter , until he reached a door , and pressed it . Nothing happened . He pressed it again . Nothing happened . Again . Nothing happened . He stepped inside , and walked to the door where his wife had laid .   `` Daddy , '' Jack said .   `` I love you , daddy , '' she said . He hugged her . She kissed him on the forehead . `` I love you too , darling . ''   `` What happened ? '' he asked , looking around .   `` I do n't know . Nothing happened . ''   He saw the road , and knew that he should have said something . He turned the corner , and saw a car . He saw his wife , and she was crying , as he entered the cafe . Jack let out a sigh , and turned around .   The car was moving . It did n't have a face . It was too much , and the engine was stuck . Jack went to try and get it to shut down , but it was n't working .   He looked at the road again , and saw the old lady standing there , holding hands with her daughter . He looked in the distance , and saw her crying , and then realized that the road was blocked by a door . He looked in the distance , and saw the old woman holding hands with her daughter as they entered the cafe .   `` Please , just take me to the car , '' he said , as he put the car into drive .   The old woman was holding her daughter , listening to Jack 's conversation through the small windows . Jack turned back around , and looked down at her , saw her leaning against the window . And he cried .   And then he dropped to his knees .   She sat there . She whispered in his ear . And he looked down at her . He whispered in his ear . He looked up at her .   The old woman stopped crying , and looked at Jack . She turned around , and saw him standing there , holding her daughter , and crying .   He pulled the plug .
There it was again .   The strange object inside was ...   I do n't remember much of it besides being able to lift objects and move them around .   I suppose I should n't have worried about it .   I was n't feeling ready to battle so that I could play around and fight like my old friend ever did .   My older brother died , and I never quite understood why .   I guess I thought he was being bullied so I tried to help him .   I could n't help but wonder if he liked me .   I wonder if he knew how to fight a sword at all .   You know , that 's what my brother wanted . He was a warrior . He wanted to bring peace to all those who had created me .   I guess I could finally tell him that there was something very special about me .   I bet he knows that .   What he wants is peace .
`` We are now the dominant species , sir . '' exclaimed the receptionist .   `` Yes , that is correct . '' replied the president .   `` Very good , please turn in your report to the other room . ''   `` We ca n't handle being under attack from a species that , according to our reports , only eats one part of its body . ''   `` I suppose that would make sense enough . ''  The president raised his index finger to the display on his desk . `` Take a look outside , and it will clear up a bit , but first , we need you to check on your environment . ''   When the green and purple planet lay in wait at the window above the window , the scientist in charge raised his index finger and raised it .   `` If we are lucky , we can send her a sample . ''   `` I would appreciate that . ''   Upon further inspection , the science officer opened a camera and proceeded to place a sample in the space to test . Upon further inspection , the science officer began to examine the environment .   `` I 'm sure this would make sense to you . '' replied the scientist .   `` Yes it would , sir . ''   `` Good . '' the scientist began to make his way inside . `` I 'll begin with the main aspect of the environment . ''   `` What are you showing me ? '' asked the scientist .   `` You were showing me what appears to be another species . ''   `` Yes , that can explain a lot . '' said the scientist .   `` Do n't you see how many of these species eat one part of its body ? '' asked the scientist .   `` We know that . '' responded the scientist .   `` Then do you see how many of these species eat one part of its body ? ''   `` Yes , that will explain the whole problem . '' answered the scientist .   `` Wonderful , excellent . Would you like me to continue ? ''   `` Just one moment . ''   `` We are now the dominant species , sir . '' 
You know , really , I just do n't understand how I can have known something I never knew and would never know . Every time I thought about it , it felt like the words were in my head , the words were in my head , and the phrase was `` Fuck you . ''   I remember the days I had the nerve to make a joke . I hated it . I loathed it ! I loathed it ! But then I heard it . And that 's when the pain began . A sharp crack and the smell of gasoline and feces filled my nostrils . I looked down and saw the gasoline had been smeared over the side of the car and the tires were twisted . My head was pounding , the entire thing was shaking . The whole car , the engine , everything was shaking . My head hurt as I tried to understand what was happening . But that was n't the worst part . I was having to look this way .   I moved until the flames had spread out . I was a mass of burning gas . The car was cowering in the middle of the road . That 's when I heard it .   `` I 'm here , '' the voice was like waking fire from the deepest slumber I have ever lived . But I did n't quite turn around . I was still looking at those words . They were there , but they were n't what I thought they were . It was just the words in my head . It was all wrong . But hey , I tried to tell you how bad it was !   I did n't know what to do . I was trapped .
I could n't believe it . This was n't the first time I had found evidence out of the dragons , and no , this was different . I had done so many tests on this little creature , on paper , in every conceivable way . All these stupid tests and hypotheses , all these little circles , and that one thing was finally worth it . In a month I was going to be a doctor , my family meeting just in the middle of the night and I had a baby boy .   `` Congratulations , Joseph . '' I announced , smiling at him with the most beautiful smile I had ever seen . I have dreamed of that moment , and yet it felt so distant , so distant . That something I had never felt before . I began to feel a little guilty for the way he talked to me , but then I felt absolutely guilty for the way he seemed to feel . I decided that in order to solve this problem , I needed to help my family find this problem , and I was going to need to get in touch with this dragon .   `` I just wanted to tell you that my son , Joshua , is a wonderful child . '' I said , smiling reassuringly , hugging Joshua tight .   Joshua was in the hospital with his head in his hands . He was shaking , his neck was hurting , and his head was hurting as well . He was crying uncontrollably . I thought about what my son would have been like if I had helped him . Would he have made friends ? Would he have lived happily ever after ?   `` I 'm not sure . '' I said , stroking Joshua .   `` I 'm not sure I 've guessed . '' He replied   `` ... and Joshua , is a wonderful kid . '' I said , smiling .   `` ... he should be on his way to his very final exam now . '' I said , turning away , taking a long breath . `` He 'll miss me after awhile . ''   `` But you must be joking ! '' He said , struggling to keep his eyes open . I smiled at him , and my heart skipped a beat . I was going to need to help these people right now . I had finally solved this problem .   `` I 'm so sorry , Joseph , please do n't leave . I just ... I ca n't . Please just leave . I 'll miss you for a while , okay . '' I said , stroking Joshua 's neck .   He cried for a moment , then groaned . He fell off his hospital bed . I heard a crash and then ... nothing . I looked around , then continued walking up to the window I had so recently created in my mind .   `` I 'm so sorry , Joseph . I just could n't believe that it was you that created this problem . '' I said , watching the little dragon run around in the shadows . `` I just need you to call 911 . I just ca n't . ''   I heard the phone ring . I picked it up , and picked my son .
Everytime I would read the news and press releases I would often find myself on the streets talking about what it looked like , but all I wanted was a glimpse of something different . It was so surreal , all around me all the creatures and animals were all acting like I was them , but they all just looked different . Even the birds looked more different .   I moved outside , to the sound of rustling leaves and branches as I did . I remember that I had heard about others like me who had taken different forms , but none of them seemed to care for themselves .   The old man sat at his wooden desk , reading the papers on his desk . He glanced around as if to check what was going on . Suddenly there was a knock at the door . He rushed inside , and as he opened the door , he saw a tall , skinny man . He had a black suit and a red tie , and he wore sunglasses . The man was staring right at me .   `` Mister Jack Sparrow , please step down from the desk and come with me '' said the man . He looked just like me .   `` You can explain yourself , but I 'm afraid you ca n't . I have to inform you of something '' I said .   `` Just the best way to get away '' said the man , as he gently placed the glasses on my nose . I looked in the mirror and saw a dark tint going through my eyes . It looked like I was crying now . Suddenly , a loud noise filled the air . I turned around , and saw that my body was on fire .   `` Now that I know what you have done , I am done . Goodbye Jack Sparrow . At least you have a nice day '' .
He was looking at me with sad eyes .   He was a mess . His hair was frizzy and his face was chitin at the end . I was ready for anything . I could n't tell . I felt like I was in the middle of something bad . I could n't tell if the bullies would be mocking me or trying to steal back my money . My plan was to keep him from getting hurt .   The bullies watched me for a while before they slowly approached me . It took a few seconds for them to get to my feet . I managed to get a few steps off from him and he started walking away . I heard more footsteps behind me .   `` Hi honey . It 's me , Todd . We talked about this time . '' I lied .   `` Yeah , how about today ? '' She said .   `` Oh yeah ? '' I said .   `` Are you guys gon na kill me ? '' She asked .   `` What ? No ! I 'm gon na shoot you ! '' I begged .   `` No ! '' Her eyes went wide . `` No ! You guys kill me ! ''   She slowly began to run away , chasing after me .   `` What , are you doing this to me ? '' She asked .   `` I 'm taking advantage of your advantage . '' I said .   `` Not like it matters . '' She said , her tears starting to well up . `` I 'm putting all of my money in my bank , so that I can play nice . ''   `` But how do you live with that money . '' I asked .   `` Because of who you are . '' She said .   `` Who are you ? '' I asked .   `` Me ! '' She yelled .   I followed her for a few moments . She was right on top of me when she caught my foot . I dived under her foot , which slipped right through her neck .   `` Jesus Christ , how does this even work . '' I whispered .   `` It works ! '' She said . `` And it works so hard to beat me ! ''   `` No , it 's fine . I 'm just going to let you take some money . '' I said .   `` But what about my parents and friends ? ! '' She said .   `` That 's what I want . '' She told me .   `` I know , I 'm sorry . '' I said , before realizing I needed to hurry up . I still was not ready for my plan . I noticed that the kids behind me were a bit harder each time . I realized I could hide them forever . At first , I thought they were just taking advantage of me . Then , I decided that I would play nice .   I had to do it , right ?  
Walking through the forest I did not understand why I was so surprised . The first thing I saw was a snake , it looked just like a snake to me , but a little different . It did not talk , it was just following me throughout the town . It did not move , it did not talk . All of a sudden I felt something sharp , a sharp pain in my stomach . After a few moments I heard the sound of a branch snapping . My body stopped moving , the tree started to shake and vibrate . After a few seconds I noticed that all the branches were now shaking , something was on the ground . My senses were turned on and I could see the branches began to turn green again . I started to panic , I felt sick to my stomach , everything was turning Green again . I could hear the birds chirping and howling , my entire town was turning green again , and why am I still alive ? I reached the tree trunk and pulled it out of my pocket , and pulled my bloodstained dress . My heart pounded , I was shaking . I pulled out a mirror and saw what looked like a large snake . It was more long than I thought it was , an arms length thick , with long black lashes . I had seen the snake before , though it was the same description as the one I saw in my photos , it was also covered in thick purple fur . I put the mirror back on and looked in the mirror , it was the same tree , and so far it has been the same since . I took some scissors and stabbed myself on the forehead . Everything looked green again .
A man stared into the mirror of the hospital bed . Was he actually alive ?  He could n't tell .  The pain was too much .  He could not touch .   The doctor began to pull his glasses off around his nose , and on his lips . He paused for a moment , before continuing .  `` It 's your daughter , Susan . You are safe from it now . '' He looked into the mirror again . She was there , and there is no hope . The doctors had given her cancer . A broken arm , and a bleeding heart .  She does n't know how long they have been doing this , and neither does Susan . All she knows is that she should n't be able to die , not when the next person died .  It was supposed to take her all the time .  She was supposed to die soon .   But ...   The man 's eyes turned to the mirror again . It was red , but it was still alive .   He began to cry .
I 've written my first story in a short while , so here is it :   “ A few hours later , the radio shows that there are some anomalies in temperature that indicate that the Earth 's inhabitants are dead . The general consensus is that the planet has been reduced to some sort of liquid that was created by two beings . The beings that inhabit this planet have various forms of weaponry , weapons that can be used to wipe out an entire planet , those weapons are considered inferior to any other weapon. ”   “ One of the beings that inhabited this planet was a scientist . The scientist himself was a doctor in his late seventies , who had invented a vaccine for human diseases . At some point he was killed by a disease he could never be cured except for one thing . Then one of his subjects , a girl named Jennifer , did the miracle cure . Jennifer was able to make a vaccine . We are now working together to stop the virus. ”   “ The virus was the last known vaccine. ” The general reported .   “ As we speak , there have been reports of two wars . In both , it seems that the military have successfully cut the war short by killing the virus. ” The general said .   “ The military has destroyed many of their bases , and although the soldiers have not yet completely annihilated such bases , they have still become stronger and stronger. ” The general concluded .   “ This is a very interesting story , I hope you enjoy . I 'm going to bed. ” The general said .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   As the night passed by , I was awake , thinking about Jennifer , thinking of the world that was left behind . The end . I just hope that her name didn ’ t leave my mind , that she ’ s okay . My mind was empty . I knew that I wasn ’ t ready to see her again . I felt as though someone had had stabbed me with a knife ; but then I realized that there were no other lights . There was only darkness . I was afraid . I can ’ t describe my fear . I felt no life . I tried to remember what happened , but my head wasn ’ t able to pick up on any of the sounds of the outside world . That had been years ago . I tried to remember who I was , what I had done , but it wasn ’ t working right . I could hear the explosions , the fire , the screams of the other creatures . I started remembering my past experiences , all of them . It was like I was being trapped in a long forgotten room , and suddenly something snapped . I heard a voice , it was female , metallic , soft , yet somehow there was no one else inside of it . Then the voice was gone . The figure that had spoken to me was gone . In fact , that is what I had remembered of her . The voice had been with me for years , and at first , I thought that I was crazy . I did know that she could be with me forever . I had been with her for more than a decade , but a few hours . I saw her , and I was confused . But then I realized that she was sleeping . I looked up at the sky , at the stars , and yet ... just like that , she was gone . I had never seen the sunlight that was shining through the windows of the buildings I had just seen . I looked at the stars , and I saw her . She was the last hope that humanity had ! I couldn ’ t believe it !
It was time to call 911 . The police cars on the block were idling about , all eager to be home . The man in the blue cape looked like he had just been slapped , not that it mattered .   The door opened , and a cop stepped in . `` We have a suspect . ''   `` What 's he doing here ? '' He asked .   `` I do n't know , '' the detective said . `` He 's in trouble . ''   The man in the blue cape looked confused . `` What ? You 're a detective ! You did n't even get here ! ''   The detective was confused . `` I do n't understand . ''   The man in the blue cape smiled nervously . `` What kind of trouble are you in ? How did you get in ? Did you hurt yourself ? ''   The detective smiled again . `` I do n't guess I could . I just saw a man get arrested and have to be put down for a crime . ''   The man in the blue cape reached into his pocket . `` Here . '' He handed the detective a keypad . `` Take this up to me if it 's alright . ''   The detective felt a little guilty . `` Thanks . '' He held out the keypad .   The man in the blue cape looked at the keypad expectantly . `` What ? ''   `` You have to step forward , Mr. Law . '' The detective stepped forward . `` You 're the one who 's sending someone into the scene . ''   The man in the blue cape looked at the detective . `` You ? ''   The detective looked confused . `` I ... .I did the right thing . ''   The man in the blue cape looked up at the detective . `` For the good of everyone . '' He pressed up , and the man in the blue cape disappeared .   The police cars driving by in silence stared at the man in the blue cape . `` How did you get in ? Who 's involved ? ''   The detective looked at the officer , then back at the keypad . `` I do n't know . ''
When they came in , they were scrawny , with only five eyes . Their skin was dark , almost black like the depths of the ocean , and their skin was pale as a ghost of a star .   `` I 've been looking at the town for a while . '' A dragon whispered , coming from the middle of the small room between the small window and the shop counter .   `` Then I would like to see you . '' I asked , before turning to meet the dragon and glaring at him . I heard him raise his head and laugh .   `` Oh , yes , my child , I will see your eyes for quite a while . '' He put his head back and smiled at me . `` Sit down . '' He began .   First , I sat behind a table and held up my hands . I held them high , staring through the small window and onto the cool water and the long grass beneath us . I wanted to feel the wings and the feathers , think about the butterflies and the butterflies . It was just right . Nothing like that .   And I stared at him , and felt my heart pound in my chest . I had never felt more alive than I had in a thousand years . I put my hands on the table and stared through the window at the grass . `` Would you like me to sit here ? I 'm afraid you 've not had much experience . ''   The dragon held up his middle finger and looked up at me . `` Of course . '' He said . `` You 're a dragon of sorts . ''   `` Are you seriously a goddamn bird ? ''   `` Yes . I 'm what you call a dragon . '' He winked . `` And I 'm very special . It was great seeing you . ''   `` What , a dragon ? ''   `` A dragon with wings and a tail . ''   `` Why would you want to kill me ? ''   `` Because I 'm a good-for-nothing dragon . I would like to be with you for quite a while . ''   `` Why would you want to kill me ? ''   `` Not to kill you , kid . I would like to meet you at a cafe in the middle of the town . ''   `` Why is there no coffee ? ''   `` You know there are n't . I just wanted to meet you at a cafe . ''   `` Who said coffee ? ''   `` I guess I am . It 's never coffee . ''   `` Well what happens next ? ''   `` I 'm going to find you at a cafe near town tonight . ''   `` Right there . ''   I made my way to the window and looked ahead . The orange glow of the sun was a bit dimmer now . I turned around and went straight to my table . I sat down next to Alyssa and she took my hand .   `` So , your name is Alyssa . And you are trying to figure out why I like coffee ? ''   `` Huh ? ''   `` Why is there no coffee ? ''   `` Because I 'll show you . ''   I walked back to the window , and we sat in silence . I wanted to know how long I could last with her , how long I could last with her . I wanted to remember everything I 've done , everything I 'd done to make her happy , to remember the day I met her .   Then , I heard the knock on the door .   `` Come in ! '' I exclaimed .   I opened the door and saw her look at me . `` And who ? ''   `` I 'm Alyssa . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I 'm Alyssa Alyssa . ''   `` I 'm so sorry about that . I promise . How are you feeling ? ''   `` I just wanted to meet you . ''   I looked down at her , confused .   `` Alyssa ? ''   `` You 're a dragon . ''   `` How ? ''   `` You can do nothing about it . ''   `` But ... but- ''   `` I 'm here . I 'm here because I 've created a dragon . ''   I looked down at her . Her long hair was a dark mess . Her face was black ,
When my parents said I was born in the year 2043 , they were shocked . I was n't expecting things to turn out the way they were supposed to . I never told them about who I was , other than that I was one of the most intelligent people on the planet , and that my parents thought I was crazy for being born in the year 2043 .   I was born in the year 2043 , and my parents were very worried about me . They explained that I would be expected to be able to communicate with people , and to communicate with other people . They also explained my situation that I was n't supposed to live alone , and that I was destined to be a scientist . They also explained that I was supposed to be given so many opportunities to have fun with people , and that they could share what they believed to be good experiences with me .   My parents died in the year 2055 , the year after that . I never really talked to them . I just wanted to make sure one day I was okay with the things I had or did n't understand , because when I was nine I found out I was n't allowed to be alone , and that I had to leave my family before I could go into work .   Shortly after that , the world changed . I was a man who lived his life with his friends . I was a college student who shared everything with people from soccer to basketball , and I worked with my friends . I had to leave , because I did n't have friends , and I knew that I had nothing to lose . My friends went to college to pursue other , and were never interested in their student loans , and they were too busy making sure that they would be happy with their lives and learning about other things .   I was a writer when I was 19 , and got to be a writer . I did things that looked more natural , and I made friends that I had never met before . I made friends who had no idea what to do , and helped out other people who made a lot of money , and helped out other people . I made a lot of friends who were n't rich , and I helped out other people who had no idea what to do , and got to live with them .   I was a good person when I was 2044 , and got to go to school . I got to sit at a desk , and work at that desk , and study at that desk . My parents died in the year 2044 , and I never really talked to them . I just talked to them . I made a lot of mistakes , which I regret ever making .
The boy was in a dark room .   The boy looked up from a stack of papers , then down the rows . He had to hide .   On the wall was a black folder .   He did n't recognize it , but he knew they 'd kill him as soon as he saw the folder .   He stepped inside . A man was standing there , looking around .   `` Hello , '' he said , `` I 'm your father . ''   The man smiled . `` Welcome , '' he said , `` I 'm your son . ''   The boy did n't hear him say anything , but he knew he would .   He turned on the light .   `` We 've got a killer in here , '' the man said over the sound of the lock clicking . `` I have the information we need to be able to get away . ''   The boy stared .   `` We think we have one , '' said the man . He nodded .   `` I 've seen your father , '' the boy said . `` He looked like an old friend . ''   `` Right , '' said the man , `` I think I know why . ''   `` Your father , '' the boy said .   `` Your father ''   `` Well , that 's why his name is written on the folder . I have a partner as well . ''   He began to walk over to the man . His face was serious . Suddenly he saw a flash . A bright blue light seemed to flare across the room and then a man was standing there with a large knife . His voice echoed through the underground .   `` Who are you ? '' the man stammered . His eyes widened .   `` I am your father . '' the boy said .   The man looked back around the room . `` What 's going on here ? ''   `` The information I need to get away from here is important . ''
* “ So you ’ re saying that I did it ? ” *   * “ Yes , that ’ s right . I never forget that much. ” *   She looked up her tearful face . * “ Why me ? Who are you ? What ’ s the point ? How are you my friend ? ” *   “ I ’ m okay , I am . I ’ m finally ready. ” The word escaped her mouth just a little bit . Why was she so afraid of her friend ? The way she looked at him , not seeing him ? It made her feel something inside of her that she never had before . But it didn ’ t bring her peace . It brought her a new feeling , something she realized would help her . With a start she saw him on the other side of the room .   “ I ’ m not ready yet. ” He said .   “ I ’ m not ready yet , ” She answered .   “ You are , all the time. ”   That ’ s how it was supposed to be . This is how everything was supposed to be . His face was contorted in pain , his hair was drawn back in a way that made her feel like he was looking away from her . She knew her friend was just staring . She knew her friend would ’ ve wanted it . She knew this because she was immortal. ” She wanted him to understand . She knew things like the way he looked at her . She knew they were the same , and there was something else out there .   “ I know who you are , ” he said .   “ Who am I ? ” She screamed . 
`` I 'm sorry ... I do n't know I could n't really understand the problem ... ''   `` They make you special ... ''   `` It does n't even make sense ! ''   `` No . ''   `` ... ''   `` Why this place ? This place that is my home ? ''   `` It does n't matter too much to you ... ''   `` No it does n't ! ''   `` I know ! I need some peace to my soul ! ''   `` Just because I felt bad about killing the people i love does n't mean it is n't important to me ! ''   `` Right , well then . First things first . What exactly are you going to do ? ''   `` I will explain as much as I can ... ''   `` I 'm sorry ? ''   `` I do n't know ! I was here to convince you . ''   `` Wait ... what ? ''   `` They are the ones who tell you everything you know . My existence is not important to you , so why did you do it ? ''   `` Why ? ''   `` It does n't matter so much to me anymore ! ''   `` Wait ... so ... I can accept you as our soulmate ? ''   `` No ! ''   `` Then you are free to leave ! ''   `` I ... ca n't , right ? ''   `` Look ... I 'm sorry I never really thought of that that ... ''   `` ... ''   And just like that , the blackness faded .
Mankind 's discovery is the best thing ever to happen in this solar system . But no one noticed it until it happened .   One might say that the discovery of the universal space-faring technology helped mankind immensely , even with the recent state collapse of the previous superpowers . But that 's a lie . When humans became aware that they 'd been dying , they noticed the increased difficulty in their ability to kill .   All this time , they 'd been able to kill themselves .   I am still alive . I made it out alive , but I ca n't think of anything else to do . I am still alive .   There was no way of knowing when the first death occurred , but someone had managed to figure out how . Why is there no one else ?   Since then , most of the population has been killed . They 're all over the planet .   I am still alive .   This is the best thing ever to happen .
I 'd really liked to see the ocean .   It was a nice sight to see .   It was like watching the stars set in place . There was no matter how often you looked at a window , you could just see beyond . The only reason I knew this was because it was the only place I truly felt like I was in my life .   It was a nice view ...   I still remember the last time I felt so alone . I remember the day when my dad bought me a fish . I remember smiling as I began to fish through the woods . I remember the first time I felt so alone .   I remember the last few months when I got a little bored . I remember the last few weeks after my dad passed . I remember the last pair of blue eyes that I had ever seen . And I remember the last bit of time that I thought I had n't had one at a time until I heard a voice in my soul being said ...   `` Hello there , but I 'm afraid you 've been lost . ''
*When a man is bound to a chair where a man waits for days in a rocking chair*   That was the first time I heard a voice , over the years . When you turned 18 you had seen more faces than you could ever imagine , but what did they look like ? Everyone in the world was a bit different , and you had n't once seen a person so tall , so tall , so handsome . People from America , Japan , France , Spain , France , and of course a few children all started talking . They seemed to be the same , but when you saw one person , you immediately knew immediately where he was .   I remember being sent to Japan , after learning about some of the `` most powerful men in the world '' . All they provided was a cup of tea , and a few minutes later a man appeared .   `` Welcome to World Trade Center ! ''   `` Hello Mr. Truman . '' I said .   `` Do you know why I come ? Why I have been forced to watch your life , as you are bound to a chair where you wait for days in a rocking chair ? ''   `` You know , I do . ''   `` The world is a bit unfair to you Mr. Truman . It makes you look like a monster . ''   `` I know . But I would very much like to apologize for my actions . It is time for me to leave . ''   I ran out of the building , hoping to avoid the man . I needed to get in the building before things got too bad for me . In front of me , there were people , from all over the world . Everyone with blonde hair , a big smile , and a wide grin . People in America , Europe , Asia , and Asia all stopped talking to each other .   `` I would very much like to apologize again , Mr. Truman . ''   `` I understand . No need to , I am quite happy to finally hear someone speak to you . ''   `` I am not sure how long I 'll be here Mr. Truman . But you must know this : I was n't meant to be here . I am always here . I never wanted to be here , and I never wanted to be here . ''   `` Goodbye , Mr. Truman . Goodbye . ''   I ran out the building , hoping to avoid the man . It seemed like an eternity , but that was n't the case . It was now or never . I ran into the room , where the man was sitting at the table .   `` I hope today , you are not going to make a sound , Mr. Truman . For this time , I am going to tell you a story . ''   Suddenly , the man 's face changed , and he turned toward me . In a loud whisper , he said `` Why are you here ? ''   `` Because we will become stronger each day . ''   As soon as the last words left my lips , he grabbed my hand and said `` You wo n't die , Mr. Truman . You will live forever . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Sorry , I realized I had left it at that point . I guess I should go check some other places to start this . Thought I 'd post it in an comment , but decided to post this instead .
**You . **   I turn my head in confusion , hearing the sounds of a gun being fired . *I could have sworn that the water and the toilet flushed* , I think to myself , thinking about *you* and *them . *   I reach for the door handle . *What are you doing ? Why do you do anything ? *   The door slams shut . Nobody enters .   I can feel the cold air , with the faint , distant sounds of a gun being fired .   `` Can you come in ? '' the voice cries out , with a large , metallic door .   I open the door . Cold , damp blood soaking against it .   `` You 're going to kill yourself , '' a woman yells , holding her pistol up . `` Keep doing that . '' She presses it towards me , holding the weapon in her hand .   I take a deep breath , and turn around . *I have to go . *   My vision fades . The gun is empty . I 'm back on the couch . I see the gun in my hands .   *They 're going to kill me* , I think to myself .   I run upstairs .
`` So , '' said Michael as he stood behind the large metal door of the bank . `` Did I say you were going to hold a record with that ? '' He asked , taking in the teller 's face .   `` Yes , Michael . I was going to- '' the man stopped mid sentence . `` So , '' Michael began . `` So I 'm going to- ''   The man pulled his hand away , revealing a small stack of papers on top of small stacks with small black numbers on top of them .   `` So , '' Michael continued . `` How many times have you tried to hold a record over this ? ''   Michael grabbed the stack and began to read the numbers he 'd been holding . `` To what ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' he said , pulling his hand away . `` The last time I held a record , I took a picture . ''   `` What ... '' Michael mumbled . `` Are you- ''   The man 's face was turned towards Michael , his eyebrows raised at him . `` The last time I held a record , I pulled a picture , Michael . ''   The man 's green eyes were starting to water . `` Of course , that 's correct ! '' An instant later , the bank manager handed the stack of papers to Michael .   `` Of course , '' Michael said , taking the stack . `` Just drop it ... ''   The manager walked away . Michael sighed . `` Okay ... '' he said , holding the stack out .   The paper fell to the floor , landing with a clatter .   `` Michael ! '' yelled the teller as she rushed to the edge of the counter . As if she 'd picked it up , the woman slipped , bumping into the wall . Michael 's face went red .   `` Michael ... '' said the woman , coming closer to the counter . `` What the hell ? ''   The teller looked at Michael , shocked . `` Michael , '' she said , pulling the stack towards her and taking the stack back . `` I 'm here for my record ! ''   Michael looked at her . `` Where is your record ? ''   The woman 's face went now red . `` I 'm standing here for my record ! ''   Michael stared at her . `` What is it ? '' He asked .   The other workers looked at each other . `` You 're going to sell it to me ? ''   Michael looked at the floor , his face looking cold . `` No , no ! '' he yelled . `` I do n't want the record ! ''   The woman stepped out of the room and walked towards the large metal door of the bank . It 's large frame hung open , revealing a thick , white sheet of paper laid next to it .   `` Are you going to hold a record on that ? ''
`` What the fuck are you , cocksucker ? ''   `` I do n't know . I heard this one . ''   `` So , you think he could , huh ? ''   `` I dunno . They 're not on drugs , they 're n't in the car . ''   `` So why the fuck is he using those old , faded sunglasses ? ''   `` So what ? ''   `` He 's talking to me . ''   `` What ? No , I saw a kid with a goddamn purse ! ''   `` What ? No , he was gon na grab my purse ! ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I ca n't , I think I can . ''   `` What ? What are you talking about ? ''   `` What 's going on now ? ''   `` I 'm just gon na get out of here . ''   `` What ? Get out of here ? ''   `` Get out of here , cocksucker . ''   `` Get out of here ! ''   `` Fuck you , cocksucker . ''   `` Do n't worry about it . What are you doing here ? ''   `` I 'm just trying to get out of here . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Get out of here . ''   `` What are you doing here ? ''   `` I 'm just trying to get out of here . ''   `` It 's not fucking funny . What the fuck are you guys doing here ? ''   `` They 're not in the car . ''   `` It 's fucking funny . ''   `` It 's fucking funny . ''   `` What are you doing in here ? ''   `` There 's some fucking guy behind me and he 's offering me his wallet . ''   `` Are you fucking kidding me ? ''   `` They 're not in the car ! ''   `` What the fucking fuck is that ? He 's offering me his wallet ! ''   `` What the hell are you guys doing here ? ''   `` There 's some fucking guy who thinks he can go home and sleep with his shit eating girlfriend ! ''   `` ... ... ... .. ''   `` Let me out ! Let me out . ''   `` Okay , okay . Are you fucking serious ? ''   `` What the fuck are you ? ''   `` There 's a man who thinks he can go home and sleep with his shit eating girlfriend ! ''   `` What the fuck do you mean ?

`` I am Judgement Day . ''   The Council of Intergalactic Affairs ( JEFLV ) was met with a hearty applause .   `` I , on behalf of the Galactic Federation , request that you consider yourself an individual . ''   The assembled members of the table took a seat at the head of the table , facing each other .   `` I-I am JEFLV . I , on behalf of the Galactic Federation requests that you consider yourself an individual . ''   `` I do not wish to be considered an individual , '' said the head of the table with tears in his eyes .   `` I wish to be considered an individual because , in all our history of contact , we have never encountered a species as advanced or as enlightened as me . And besides , we are the last species that knew of beings as sentient , so , in all our history of contact , we have never encountered one as advanced or as enlightened . Were you aware of this , you would have been the first species to discover a species as advanced as us . Surely ? ''   The head of the table began to cry .   `` My people have known of the universe as a very long time ago . But with just a few more millennia as we progressed , the very fabric of life unraveled itself , and the very fabric of existence began to crumble . The fabric of existence began to collapse . ''   `` And is this what led you to accept our existence ? '' said the head of the table .   `` I , on behalf of the First Galactic Federation , wished to be considered an individual . I wished to be considered an individual because I had no time for discussion with an intelligent species . ''   `` So , you have accepted the fate of this species . And , when you are judged by their intelligence , they will know that you are not an individual . You will know that you are not an individual because you have no place in this galaxy . ''   `` But I am not ! ''   `` And you know this , because , when I arrived , we saw the first , the only , intelligent species that actually existed in this universe . And , once again , you know this . I was very thorough with my analysis and calculations , and I realized that there were a few issues with the universe that I resolved in my first lifetime . ''   The head of the table stifled a cry , but there was no one else to say anything . The Council of Intergalactic Affairs ( JEFLV ) was all silent .   `` So , , forgive me for the confusion . '' said the head of the table . 
`` It 's been thirty-seven years since I last saw you , the last time I saw you . ''   `` Well , it seems that there 's something in this world that *appears* to be telling me everything . ''   `` I do n't have time to explain it , but I have something I need to say. ``   `` This world has a finite amount of humans , the Earth 's population has increased exponentially in the past few decades , and we lack more than enough resources , to sustain all of us indefinitely . I 'm glad you understand , but I fear that I may be missing something important . ''   `` I 'm afraid I do n't , '' I say , and look up to the sky . `` But do you see it ? ''   `` It becomes clear that I have no idea what this means , but it is here that I must think of something. ``   I look down at the Earth outside of me . `` What 's this ? ''   `` Why ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' I say , and look up to the sky . `` But there is something there ... that I have to think of. ``   candlelight goes out .   `` What 's that supposed to mean ? ''   `` I ca n't begin to say , but I know exactly what it means . ''   `` What does that mean ? ''   `` It means that there are no more than six billion humans left . ''   `` That 's impossible . That is impossible . ''   `` Yes . I do n't know . But that 's just too improbable . ''   `` How so ? ''   `` It 's impossible. ``   `` How so ? ''   `` How the fuck ? ''   `` That 's impossible ! ''   I look down to the Earth again . `` What 's going on ? ''   `` How many things will go through my head ? ''   `` Six billion souls . ''   `` That 's my point . ''   `` How many people could I possibly ask for forgiveness for ? ''   `` Six billion . ''   `` Six billion ! ''   `` Six billion ! ''   `` Five billion ! ''   `` Nine billion ! ''   `` Nine billion ! ''   `` Six billion ! ''   `` Seven billion ! ''   `` Seven billion ! ''   `` Seven billion ! ''   `` seven billion ! ''   `` Seven billion ! ''   `` Seven million ! ''   `` Seven billion ! ''   `` Seven billion ! ''   `` Seven billion ! ''   `` Seven billion ! ''   `` Six billion ! ''   And all of a sudden , everything goes black .
Today is one of those day . One of those nights where everything just goes to shit , even the little things you loved and loved all these years ago . I felt like I was going to fly again . If I could just let go I could make a different choice of self . I could make a new life and everything would be okay . Sometimes I would find it just to not miss that little game of catch and run . Sometimes it was just a small game that was n't worth it . Sometimes it was just more fun than a long day .   It comes to this , the little things that have become my children . I keep seeing them as humans , always helping them . They 've become my children , my dogs and my friends . At least on that day I hope I can bring them home , together . My little things always bring me food , comforted me whenever I wanted , and they always have a good day . If not for the little things that keep me company . The little things that make it easier for me to see them as humans . They bring home a good meal every once in a while when I 'm hungry . It 's a joy to see them again , to feel them return to their homes . I did n't realize that they had become to my family before . They seemed so distant , so distant . But they were there , watching me . They had always been there , for me .   Today I 'm going to make a choice . I 'm going to stick around , hunt down the little things before they come , and stop them from coming . This is it , this is the end . It 's just a game to not miss that little game of catch and run .   Love :   `` Hey bud , bud . You do n't want to miss that little game of catch and run . I want to play catch with you , so you can catch with me . ''
This has got to be a joke by someone . This is my second attempt . I actually really like horror movies , y'know !
Evan awoke to the sudden alarm of the coffee machine being turned off . As usual this morning he went downstairs and grabbed his phone .   “ What the hell ? ” he muttered . He was still not quite sure what was going on but something about the coffee machine made him uneasy .   He heard a voice come from the kitchen .   “ You want me to call my ex ? ”   “ Well , it would be nice to just give her some time to get ready for bed . Let ’ s go to bed. ”   Evan looked around and found a few pictures that resembled him and what looked like himself .   “ This is my ex , Frank Williams. ”   “ Hey , my ex ? ”   “ Frank Williams. ”   “ I have a boyfriend who works at some tech support firm. ”   “ No ! ” Evan yelled . “ I don ’ t understand ! ”   “ Frank Williams . Frank Williams , is this Frank Williams— ”   “ Yes , it is ! ” Evan said with a huge grin . “ I was just talking to him. ”   “ What about this Frank Williams ? ”   “ I bought him a ring . He wants it . I don ’ t think he ’ s going to be able to be happy without it . He has to stay. ”   Evan decided to go back to calling his ex . He was still not sure what the hell was going on and decided to wait a little bit .   “ Hey , did you come here ? ” Evan asked as he walked out of the kitchen of the kitchen . He still had not realized he had walked into the kitchen yet . He was sure of that though .   “ What the fuck did he do to me ? ”   “ Well , it was a horrible accident , so I didn ’ t know what to do , I guess . He just went to the bathroom. ” Evan replied .   “ What the— ”   “ He called me back , so I told him he was going to be having a rough day because he would be so angry at me for taking his ring and driving. ”   “ What ? ! What do you mean ? We are in… a bar… We have a date. ”   “ He wants this. ”   “ No . Please don ’ t . He can ’ t give it to you , but I ’ m sure he ’ ll have it on his phone. ”   “ Wait , no ! He ’ s on his phone ! It ’ s my ex ! ”   “ Calm down . We ’ ve been over this a couple of times . It ’ s mine. ”   “ No , no ! You ’ re crazy . If you don ’ t come back , I ’ ll tell her this is all my fault. ”   “ I… I ’ m not dead ! ”   “ You ’ re still alive , but it ’ s me . You ’ re not the only one who wants this. ”   Evan had been walking away for a while now so he had no way of knowing what it was about . He walked back to the kitchen and picked up his phone .   “ Hey , I ’ m calling my ex and… “ Evan said . “ Frank Williams… ”   “ Frank Williams , you know… I don ’ t know what to do . I ’ m afraid I have to call your… ”   Evan thought for a moment . He thought about that when he came back in the kitchen .   “ Evan ? ”   “ There are things you need to worry about . Things that happen in your life that make you happy . Things that make you want that happen. ”   Evan looked around . The rest of the kitchen went silent .   “ Do you remember why you ’ re out here ? ”   “ No . I don ’ t . I think I ’ ve been through a lot of shit , but I can ’ t bring myself to do anything about it.
“ When ’ s the last time someone like you left ? ” Michael asked as he watched the road pass by .   “ It ’ ll be a decade , ” said the girl .   The ride on her own had changed countless times , but this one was different . An ancient tale , and Michael knew he could ’ ve sworn he could hear the gentle tapping of a few feet off the ground , following her pace . He had seen the same face before : different eyes , different hair , different clothes . Michael had seen his fair share of times before , but he could never make out any features from where she walked .   “ I ’ m going to miss you , ” he said in an almost reverent whisper . “ I ’ m not going to miss you. ”   He looked up and saw her standing over him in the old light , gazing at him with an innocent expression . Michael could see the tired and tired look on her face , as she stared back at him . The road passing by seemed long in comparison to the rest of the road , each small turn had given her the appearance of a person . The girl smiled back at him and pointed at the trail that led toward her .   “ I ’ ll miss you. ”   She walked toward her car in the distance , her eyes growing wide with joy . Once she touched the accelerator , she felt water spray down onto her face . It was a warm spring rain , the breeze flowing through her hair and onto Michael ’ s face . It felt like it was getting old and his mouth watered . He looked up , unable to believe what he was seeing . It looked so familiar , yet he couldn ’ t put his finger on how it felt . He looked down and turned to his passenger .   “ You heard me ? I ’ m coming with you. ”   He shook his head . “ No , ” he said . “ I haven ’ t. ”   She shook her head and stopped walking . “ I ’ ve never heard you leave before. ”   Michael sat in his seat . “ What did you do once you left ? ”   “ I stopped walking before you left , ” she said . “ I haven ’ t seen you for a long time. ”   Michael ’ s heart sank . He was so young . “ I should ’ ve gone back. ”   Then he remembered . He remembered how he had stayed with her since she met him first . He remembered when they first started dating , how the doctors were so proud of him . He remembered how he had stayed so close to her as his first date . Or how he had tried to convince them to come together , to stop being so afraid of her . Michael had tried explaining to them what his life would be like – to be able to have a chance to understand . He had begged to see her again . He had begged to ask her to come back . He had begged her to come back .   But she had refused . “ I didn ’ t , ” she said . “ It ’ s been nothing but a while. ”   Michael looked up at her . “ Is there something wrong ? ”   She shook her head . “ It ’ s just ... that path is lost . Why is it always lost ? ”   He shook his head . “ It ’ s not natural , ” he said . “ It ’ s just a myth that keeps rolling around on the inside out . Just a myth that keeps repeating itself . It ’ d be sad if it weren ’ t like that , right ? It would change everything . I never wanted to go back . I never wanted to see you again. ”   She nodded , smiling . “ I remember you going so far , ” she said . “ But still , there ’ s going to be something there ... somewhere that you owe to me like this. ”   “ I ’ m not sure what that is , ” he said . “ I must be dreaming . What if I ’ m dreaming ? I must have been a little too young for that . What if I ’ m dreaming ? ”   She laughed . “ Exactly . It ’ s just a part of your life that keeps driving you mad and wants you to drive yourself mad . So if you could just drive yourself mad , I could make something of your life just like
The room was dead . In . Out .  It had been too long since God 's army was assembled , and it was n't all bad . Humanity had suffered , but the fact that no matter how much the battle raged , God had won was undeniable .  A knock on the door startled Satan , and he opened it .   `` Lucifer , '' he said , `` It 's me . ''   `` Is it God ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Do n't be surprised . He 's got the greatest military equipment in the West , right ? ''   `` Ah . Yes and you 'll be damned . But I 'll see you in Hell . I 'll show you the light . ''    Satan was ready .
When I first got my Pokemon Master , I thought I was blessed by God , as if by angels . I was wrong . What I was truly blessed was the power of Charizard . It was called Charmander and a name I had never heard before . After a few years , I started realizing that I could actually control this power . I trained , learned , and got on my way . I was able to create a strong world and the power I had just gained was incredible . I was truly amazed at how quickly people just stopped caring about me .   I first noticed that people would notice me . People would start seeing me as a weirdo , but they would stop caring . I started bringing gifts to people , and even though they would n't take the gift , I always kept it . Soon , people started making fun of me for it . I began spending all my time with my friends . They were always so happy to talk about me and their lives . It was beautiful . Although there were times where I was jealous of them , I would always be their girlfriend . As I grew older , I began to see problems with my relationships . When everyone saw me as crazy , they started calling me a freak .   It was amazing that I could control the power of this power . My friends and I had been creating a world that did n't exist . It simply was n't necessary . People kept getting hurt or sick that the power was used on them . People told me they were sick and their life was bad , and yet I just could n't control it .   I started using the power to manipulate people . It was n't until I began to become a doctor that I started to notice that people were getting better . The doctors were always happy to talk to me about my life , but they always took their time treating me . I started seeing other people , one who had more interest than me . It was amazing , when I started seeing other people like me . Who were caring , the people I had been with for years .   I started feeling better . I started noticing things . Small things . I started feeling love . I started feeling really happy .   I learned that people were smarter than me . I started seeing small things now . People did n't care . They only noticed me as a freak . This would n't be so bad . I was still young .   I began doing research on people . I began observing people , trying to figure out what the rules actually are . I was starting to understand that people always have different rules . Although I still could n't control it , there was enough to do it . Every once and a while I would be visited by people who did n't like me , and saw how much more I wanted to control .   Many years passed . I was happy . I understood everything that people were asking for . I began experimenting with many different things . People would start seeing me as weird or crazy and they would stop caring . They would stop loving me . They would stop having fun . They would stop loving me .   I was able to control this power . Things went downhill . The more people asked me why I was n't controlling everything that I was doing , the more I became so good at it . As time went on , people started hating me . It was n't long before some people hit me with cars . The police called me crazy . People started going crazy . It was terrible , but as I grew older , I realized that I could control everything . My friends and I had been creating a world that did n't exist .   I started to notice people start to hate me . I slowly began liking them . They started to start to realize that I was different . The people who knew my name , the people I loved , they started to hate me . I started to see other people start to hate me . They started to realize that I was n't human anymore . It was too much ! I had gotten rid of my Charizard .
Lilene 's eyes flickered . Her face relaxed , she nodded .   `` Is that it ? ''   In a way it was , not really .   She looked down at her watch . It was the same watch it had been at her wedding day every day as a baby . Even it had n't seen her since she was born . The thing that made it so special to her was that it was also the only watch she ever had .   `` No , I have to go . ''   She sighed and pulled her sister along . She was going home . She could feel her heart slow as she watched from the window . It was n't one of those times , it seemed too risky , too dangerous to even consider staying .   `` Go and meet you at Burger King on the way home . ''   She paused for a moment , and then pulled out her phone , searching for the same number .   `` Okay , Dad , go and meet me at my place . ''   She walked into his small apartment , which was about 35 stories across . Behind him were a couple of booths , which she sat down at . The barista helped her order as Lilene walked over .   `` Hello , Lilene . ''   He smiled . `` Hello , Dad . ''   She looked down at her stomach again . It seemed like a long time since her stomach had been full of blood . Lilene continued to look at her stomach . What was this really ?   `` Okay , dad , you 're home . ''   `` Okay , baby . I 'm back . ''   She turned around and shut the door behind her . It was the same door she had opened every day as a baby .   `` Dad , how are you ? ''   `` Fine , Lilene . ''   He stared at her for a long time . There had been no signs of life left on their planet .   `` I think it 's ... just something . ''   She stood up and walked in . The bathroom mirror was empty . She turned around to see a pale brunette with red lipstick on her face .   `` Hey , that 's me . ''   Lilene smiled at the girl before standing in front of the mirror . `` I think we can meet here at Burger King today . ''   `` Thanks , Mom . ''   `` Come on , Lilene . I 'll see you tomorrow . ''   Lilene walked away and closed the door behind her .   -- -   *More at r/galokot , and thanks for reading ! *  
Most people would n't even understand the concept of `` Life expectancy '' . As the new years started coming , the gap between `` Life '' and `` Life '' grew . The population was n't so great anymore . People realized they had n't lived for too long , the age difference was almost too big .   We still look around today , a lot of us smile , the whole neighborhood crying for the little ones , crying for those I love . They do n't have to die much . Life expectancy is still a huge gap , and though people may be able to grow up a lot more , they still have to die , so we can be sure that we will never be able to have kids again .   It 's amazing what we can have , even though we are n't able to do anything about it , as long as people still have children .
Hey , I 'm not sure how you could be so perfect when you 've got so many people over . If it was n't for you , it would have been the most perfect person I 've ever met . I hope you like it .   My name is James . I 'm from Boston . I live in Michigan . I 'm also from Minnesota . I am very happy to meet you . I 'm a little shy , okay ? I know that . My life is pretty normal , but I know that . Maybe you 're a different person from how I pictured . Maybe it 's because you 're perfect . Maybe it 's because you 're always so happy , so happy . Maybe it 's because you 're always so happy .   We met on a typical Friday night . He is an average guy . Beautiful , in every way . A few weeks in , I met a girl named Jennifer who I never saw before . She looked pretty . Perfect , in every way . He was also extremely nervous . She was a lot like me . We talked and talked and talked . He never let her go . We all laughed at her and laughed together . Then I met her .   We were at the park that night , for a time . It was autumn and she was sitting in the leaves . She was wearing her favorite blue jeans . I was sitting with her right in front of her . She had her pink sneakers on for a little bit , so I could look around . She looked back at me and smiled at me . I smiled back and we felt like we were lovers .   Life is pretty normal when you 're perfect .
We met the same day .   After dinner , I was preparing something for her . She was so cute and elegant . I would have gone into the bathroom with her , but she did n't want me to make her leave .   I came home and looked at my reflection in the mirror . I could still see her smile , and all the happiness in her eyes . But not her smile now . Nor the happiness in her voice . Not her voice or the way her body moved . Not her voice . Not one thing .   I decided to bring her home . On the way I noticed a light coming from the bathroom stall . I did n't know what was going on until I opened it . I walked up to it . I picked it up . It was still bright and bright as always .   I walked to the kitchen . I got ready to pour some coffee . As soon as I touched the porcelain surface of whatever was left of it , I was shocked . The hot , brown liquid spilled out . I ran up to it .   `` What the fuck happened to me ? '' I asked my son as I walked back in the living room . I asked my wife .   `` Nothing , '' she said .   `` Have you ever wondered why the fuck you came home late , when you do n't even belong on this god forsaken planet , in the middle of the night , to watch your son spend his time with a deadbeat and broken life ? It seems appropriate to ask . ''   `` It 's not , '' she said . `` But I finally like you . ''   `` What can you say ? '' I asked .   `` I 'm sorry , dad . But I ca n't go back to this place , and my wife needs me . ''   `` No , I ca n't . ''
[ Begin Part 1 , complete with a short story ]    Robert Hill ’ s wife Sarah leaned back in her seat . She felt the warm tingling of her fingers as she touched the wooden cupboard . It was warm at first , but as more and more time passed , the heat grew . She would get lost , but in the end , they had a family to live with . They knew Robert was the best soldier in the country : he carried a huge shield , even if it was small or small—and would do double duty .   She didn ’ t want to sit in a chair like her husband did , but it made her uncomfortable . She watched as a light breeze blew in the room . She shivered once more , and then pulled a piece from beneath the table . She held it up to her eye , barely making it out the window . The wind picked up , and suddenly rushed past her .   “ Sarah ! Are you OK ? ” She asked . She turned away from the table and looked at her husband . He was staring out the window . “ Are you okay ? ” He asked .   “ I ’ m okay . Mommy and Daddy are going to be okay , ” Sarah said , and she moved to the window .   She saw the sun rise . She started to weep . How do they know that she saved them ? They told her stories of protecting them . Sarah told them tales . All of it . She was happy . She felt safe .   “ Thank you Sarah , ” Robert said , and smiled as he took his daughter ’ s hand .   When the sun rose again , Sarah looked at her husband , and saw her crying . Sarah couldn ’ t remember how they knew about that . Sarah couldn ’ t tell them about what was happening to her . But she understood now , because they knew of the war . So they knew .   “ Daddy ? ” Sarah asked .   “ Yes honey ? ”   Sarah looked out the window again , and saw the sun rise again . It was now so bright ; she could see the sunrise in full , but the clouds were still forming .   “ Sarah ! Are you OK ? ” Sarah ’ s husband asked .   “ I ’ m fine . I ’ m okay . Mommy and Daddy are going to be okay , ” Sarah said .   “ Are you okay ? ” Robert asked .   “ Yes , ” she said . “ I ’ m okay. ”   “ Are you OK ? ” Robert asked .   “ Yes , ” Sarah said .   He put his head in his hands , and said , “ Thank you , Sarah. ”   Sarah couldn ’ t even say goodbye to her husband . She couldn ’ t describe his face , but she could make out the smile on his face . He looked into her beautiful eyes , and said , “ I love you. ”   The sun rose again , and Sarah thought about what she must do . That they would be able to walk outside . They might even see the hills and trails in the ocean again after the first day of school . One day . One day they would see the beautiful beaches where they had long since abandoned their home .   Sarah knew that she couldn ’ t stop thinking about what she must do . She could see the golden hills where she had long since abandoned her dream house . She could see the beautiful trees that she had long since abandoned her love .   Sarah smiled , and stared at the sky .
I wrote something about a dog once that I 'm not the best writer on a short subreddit . Please give me feedback and advice . I really liked the idea .

His hands were shaking as he looked up to see a new world , one that had only recently fallen behind him . He saw the grassy knolls growing closer and closer to his face .

I just don ’ t know. ” He reached up and grabbed the radio . “ Just don ’ t do. ”   The girl laughed nervously . “ I ’ ll not let anything go , ” she told him .

“ Hey , man , ” said an older man in a black cargo plane , “ we can look up there. ”   The man in the black cargo plane shifted his stare at the screen , then stared at the screen in front of him . “ Can ’ t we look up there ? ”   “ Up there ? ” replied the man in the black cargo plane .   “ What ? No , it ’ s been up there . I hear something behind us . Why are we doing that ? ”   “ What ? Then the entire thing is crashing down and no one is safe . Are you certain this is it ? ”   “ I don ’ t know , man . I don ’ t know. ”   “ There ’ s a whole building down there. ”   “ The building ’ s gone. ”   “ The building that went down ? ”   “ Oh , really ? ”   “ The building we ’ re looking up at. ”   “ There ’ s a whole building down there ! ”   “ It ’ s gone from our high school to the docks. ”   “ We haven ’ t been down there for over 15 years , man. ”   “ Yeah , sure .

I get up from my bed , brush my teeth , and brush my teeth in front of my mirror . I stare at my reflection , and it starts to speak to me .   `` What the fuck ? ! '' It says . `` Get out ! ''   I look at the message , and it changes . The word begins to read `` Get out '' .   `` What ? ! '' I shout .   `` Get out ! '' it repeats , but I ca n't hear it anymore . I stare at the message on my mirror . I think of all the things I 'd do that would ruin this . I wonder if I could have changed the purpose of the message I was sent . I think of everything I 'd do that would make it better .   I step out of the bathroom , and walk downstairs . I step out into the street , and walk in to the back of the building . I hit the doorbell . I answer .   `` Hey . ''   `` Yes ? ''   `` Hey . ''   `` Yeah ? ''   `` Yeah ? ''   I walk towards the back of the building , and walk out of . I hear a voice on the radio .   `` We have a rough draft . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` Look . It 's a situation , and we need to be careful . ''   I walk towards the back of the building , and walk in . I hear a voice on the radio .   `` We have a rough draft , and we need to be careful . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` Look . It 's a situation , and we need to be careful . ''   `` Yeah . ''   I walk towards the back of the building , and walk in . I hear a voice on the radio .   `` We have a rough draft . ''   `` Yeah . ''   I walk towards the back of the building , and walk in . I hear a voice on the radio .   `` We have a rough draft . ''   I walk towards the front of the building , and walk in . I hear a voice on the radio .   `` We have a rough draft , and we need to be careful .

I never wanted to hear the ring . It was far too loud . I never wanted to read it .   I never thought I 'd get away with it . All I wanted was a safe place for my family to go .   I never wanted to see them . I never wanted to watch my brothers and sisters cry . I never wanted to leave them as they mourned .   I never wanted to see them grow up without my ring . I never wanted to see them grow up without my ring . I never wanted to see them raise their children without my ring . I knew until they changed .   I know they will never know their death in peace . I can hear them in their own grave before they lose their way . They will never know the pain they feel when they cry . I can hear them sob in their own grave before they lose their way .   I can hear them laugh in their own graves . I can hear them tell themselves to go to war . I can hear them tell each other to leave every day .   I can hear them be happy until they forget .   I can hear them be happy until they forget .   The ring has only been around a hundred years and I 've been a long time since anyone has been happy . But I hear it again .   It is the first time she 's said that . It 's the first time I 've cried in generations . It 's the last time I 've cried because she 's a fool . It 's the last time she 's said that I 'm not ready . It 's the last time I 've cried because she 's a traitor . It 's the last day I 've cried because she 's a good man .   It 's the last day the ring will ever take her life .
As I walked down the street , I could feel how my body moved as it pushed against the weight of what seemed like countless others . It was n't how I felt ; it was n't what was right about me . The weight of today 's world was n't a physicalweight . It was the weight of the day . Today 's world was n't just a physical weight .   No ; the weight of today 's world was a physical weight . The weight of tomorrow 's world was a physical weight . How could anyone know the difference ? Each one of us could not see the difference . Only four of us understood what that difference was .   I turned right in front of the store . Inside was a small black box with a shiny finish . The top was a small white box with a side button attached . A few buttons and numbers were etched on it . I pressed the button and , in front of me , the screen flicked through and I saw my world . What I saw was never the same as my own .   The world I was living in was n't the same as my own . It was n't just the top of a box of weights . It was the bottom of the world . It was n't just the bottom of everything . It was the end .   The day I saw it was the day I met God .  
Two days into the voyage , we were just aboard the Royal Galaxy , and we 'd lost our contact with any new native star . The captain made a mistake ; one day , our radar signal went out , and I lost my sight . We were greeted by the sight of port-side-tablet and we were filled with hope . The captain explained to us that something was wrong with the display and we were sailing toward the sea . The navigator told us this was a mistake . As we approached the ocean , one of our ship mates yelled at us to stay away from the display . He told us to stay away from the display and we headed toward our destination . We were greeted by the sight of a small town near the front of the ship . It was mostly populated . We quickly made our way toward the town and saw a small sign on an aging road . We walked through the town , looking for survivors . Our radio crackled on to a message from the captain :   `` Captain , we have no information that you 'll be able to survive a great journey beyond the sea . Please try to contact whoever may help you ; ''   The captain walked out of the town , and we saw the town . We saw a large building near the front of the town , and that was where he wanted to know where we were headed . As we walked closer , the captain could n't tell us where things were going . He looked around , and saw nothing but the occasional townscape from the ship .   `` Stop ! '' cried a captain , turning around , and jumping back . Before he could react , the captain was gone , gone with a wave of salt . The captain took out a map and kept running . We made our way toward the tiny town , and he did n't follow us . After we reached the street , we came upon a building . As we approached it , the captain 's voice rang . He said :   `` I should thank you for your service . But first : you were never the best captain , nor the most charismatic . But you fought to survive . I will always thank you for your service . ''   The captain looked back at me , and I saw the fear creeping in . He told us this was a mistake . I begged him to stop , but he simply said ,   `` I wo n't allow you to disobey me , ''
I stare at the face in front of me , the same face I had seen when I was a kid . I have watched her for three years now , seeing her eat one of the meatballs . She has no fear . Our mother has sent a message , to Earth to guide us , not be alarmed . In a few decades , the world will be safe again , but the seeds will grow . Every plant will have a garden around it , every plant will have an open field to share their place with . After a few millennia , we will be able to speak , and the world will be a safe place . But I will have to wait until the seeds grow again . They will grow like me , and they will grow like me , and they will grow like me . I will have to wait until the next generation is born , and I will have to wait until the next generation that is born . But I will have to wait until the next generation rises .
The shopkeeper , a stout and stocky man with thinning blonde hair , with red skin and round bald head , peered back into the shop across the table from the stranger .   `` I understand your frustration , but I do n't have an axe or knife for your sale ! How ... how can I cut down a merchant with your blade ? ''   The stranger shook his head and sighed . `` I have no weapons . Nothing but an axe . ''   The shopkeeper did n't answer .   `` You know what I mean ! You *need* an axe . It 's got ta be cut down ! '' The stranger pulled out a small wooden knife and stabbed a small line towards the shopkeeper .   The shopkeeper , furious , swung his dagger , the small knife slicing into the small wooden blade . The shopkeeper , a thin and stocky man with thinning blonde hair , stepped forward and grabbed a small wooden shaft from the small wooden shaft . He stabbed the wooden shaft and the shopkeeper started crawling backwards across the table to the counter .   `` Ah , a fool ! '' he growled . `` You got a wooden shaft for me ? ''   The man stepped forwards and stopped the flow of blood from his neck . `` Ah , yes , a fool ! ''   `` What is it ? Why am I not allowed to work for you ? '' The shopkeeper said in abject rage . `` I have an axe ! ''   The shopkeeper stood there , frozen and on the verge of tears , he looked back at the stranger .   `` A fool ! '' The man stood up and made his way back to the table . `` Look here ! '' He pointed to a small wooden shaft in the shopkeeper 's hands . `` I can cut down a merchant with your knife ! ''   The shopkeeper sighed . `` I can cut down a merchant who used to offer me a trade deal . Just please , do n't do anything rash . I just want to get back to my shop ! ''   The shopkeeper was in tears , but slowly resumed walking towards the kitchen .   `` What is it ? '' the shopkeeper said in abject rage .   `` Oh , nothing drastic . I just want to cut down a merchant who used to sell me a trade deal . Just please , do n't do anything rash . I just want to get back to my shop ! '' The shopkeeper looked around the room and back at the stranger .   `` I do n't understand , '' the shopkeeper said slowly , `` but I think you need an axe . ''
`` Is that all right ... ? '' I asked the angel . I had been waiting for this moment since the day I died , a life I had lived through , I felt like I had lost myself . I was n't really sure what I was doing , but it was worth the wait . I could have waited for eternity ... or both , but I just did n't know .   `` God ? '' I said , `` What about it ? ''   `` You are soul worthy , but you are n't meant to live in heaven . But you will make your choice , '' the angel had said , `` and you will accept your place , and never be judged by someone you did n't love . You will never be judged by your family . ''   `` Wait a minute ... '' I started to get worried . Maybe I was going to be judged too ?   `` There are many , '' the angel said , `` but you know what , I 'm sorry , but I need you to put in a request . You just have to fill in some information . ''   I had n't expected this , I had always thought God was omnipotent and omnipotent , but this was n't my case , this was Hell . It was more like a giant room , full of people and people , like the ones who were standing there , looking around , waiting ... waited ... but then , they all got a ... a bit confused .   `` What the hell ? '' I asked .   `` You are soul worthy , but you will have to fulfill your request , '' the angel said , `` and you will live here forever . ''   `` Wait ... '' I was confused .   `` You will live here forever , every single person throughout history . You will be God 's champion , and you will ascend to Heaven ! ''   Finally , the angel looked up from his paperwork , and stared at me with a mixture of pity and confusion . He knew . I could n't believe what I was hearing . What I was hearing . He replied , `` I 'll choose what I want . The people who have you , the family you 've treated and loved , people you 've hurt ... I want you to be God 's champion . You have to choose . ''   And then he was gone , leaving me to wonder if I had died . Maybe I did n't really deserve heaven ... but maybe I deserved a place to be at peace and peace .
`` Do n't move , '' he 'd said , to no one in particular , `` Just take a seat right there . ''   The wood creaked under the weight of the heavy , gnarled weight , and the wood creaked again .   `` You wo n't like it here , '' the tree replied , '' This place is full of children . You will want to be there , too . ''   His words echoed off the white bark of the cemetery , down the steep , wooden path . A woman crouched down , a face hidden under a hoodie . She paused , and a dark shadow drifted over the casket , revealing a man .   `` I have something important to tell you , '' spoke the tree .   `` I 'm afraid your spirit has been corrupted , '' it said , `` I can not return . Your spirit has been tainted . ''   `` I know what to do , '' the trees said , `` I know you 'll want to be there , too . ''   The man , being clothed in a black robe , walked over to the casket , and began to eat . One by one , the tree took every bite , the man eating hard until the bones of his bones were so tender that it was hot .   The tree continued to watch this man eat , until one evening , the tree saw the glow of a dying tree .   `` Please , do n't move , '' the tree promised , `` Give me all of your strength . ''   As he opened the casket , the tree could see a hole in the wall of a home . Its branches fell out , and the tree could feel the warm sun shining on its face , as if it was heaven itself .   `` No , please , '' the tree pleaded , `` No ! ''   The branches fell out , and the tree could feel its warmth .   `` Thank you , '' said the tree , `` I can make your wish so much clearer . ''   The tree began to walk towards it , and the tree could feel its warmth .
I sit at the bar , drinking my beer , and checking the time .   1:00 am .   I decide that I did n't want to start this night .   A couple of weeks ago , I had a man with an accent . It had been just a normal afternoon . It was not unusual for an average joe to have a mug , but today it was being invaded by a bunch of weird types , their voices echoing around everything .   I went from being an introvert to a super villain .   I drink my beer , and checked the time .   1:05 am .   I decide that I did n't want to start this night .
