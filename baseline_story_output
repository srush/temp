`` Now we have an invitation to keep theatre . '' James screamed , waving his fingers at the host . The actors walked past him looking at him .   `` So there 's no way this wo n't be happening , so tell us what to do . ''    The screen flashed once more and people were on the stage . `` A moment ago the actor had proposed , the actor had suggested that he had seen the same movie . ''    James felt himself falling .    The director frowned , giving him a weak glare .    `` Well it 's getting dark now , so he knows that we are up with an Oscar , but ... he knows that we were going to be late again . He has no idea what the ratings are looking for , so he figured he might not be able to turn the tide . Everyone knows we are in trouble . ''    The director paused for a moment . `` It 's a tradition that they know each other , so we ca n't let them come back to the studio , do n't worry . ''    `` So then he was going to be late again . If he was late he would n't be late again , so he could n't be late again . ''    `` But it always does . And now I 'd have to go . And that 's all it matters . I 'm just going to do that . ''     James felt himself falling to the floor .    The actor walked out leaving and ran to the camera .
They always had something to do . Everyone had a story . Like the guy who wrote the story , it was too much . Nobody liked it . Nobody really liked it . Nobody wanted the idea of a person , or the type that was . And that was the story he wrote . All people had fun . They tried to help him . But everyone had actually read that story . It was the kid who loved it . And no one cared about it . He knew exactly that . It was something he had seen in his whole life , something he had heard about on his laptop . There was no way it would hurt though . No one ever took a day for the kid . It was just that people always wanted to write some of the story .   To these people , however , it never hurt much . There were always a lot of people who wanted to write a story in their own right , but they would always hope they was happy when they were sad . If they were happy then what would happen if they were happy ? They would never have to let them go . They liked it . They just tried to make people happy . They could feel his heart beating faster , and they had to be happy . They could feel the sun burning against the ground . They could n't do anything , just feel the wind brushing against their skin . They would make it go down to the ground and slowly feel the cool skin of each other .   However , then , if they did n't , they would just walk away . They would always try to tell them I was happy . If I did n't , I would never have to go back to Earth . It would n't be like that . It would be nice to see them . To see them happy . To see them happy . There was never one person who wanted to be happy .
`` What do you mean . ''   `` My lord , you murdered , my Lord ! ''   `` What do you mean ? ! ''   `` Then why do you kill me ? ''   `` Why do you kill me ? No . No . I 'm not . ''   `` I 'm not .

There was no way anyone could have to be called me a king , no , that was n't the case . I saw the Empire 's eyes peering into the wide eyes that had wandered across the room . The Emperor did n't look at me , but was shocked by the lack of a word . He 'd had a long look in his eye .   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` You do n't look like a king . ''   `` Who would have known ? ''   `` I killed you . ''   `` You did n't do it . ''   `` You do n't believe me . I killed you , my lord . I killed you with your own hands , my lord .

`` So , you 've done something ! ''   Mr. Teller glanced at the clock , and turned back to his teacher .   `` Excellent , Mr. Teller . ''   The class shook slowly , holding hands together .   `` Yep , I 'm done with that . ''   She smiled , and sat down .   The class closed their eyes and closed their eyes , for a long moment , before closing their eyes , it was about a moment that people could n't contain their tears . In fact , the teacher 's eyes were now wide with tears .   The teacher was now sitting , his head resting on the teacher 's shoulder .   `` Oh , hi , '' She said , smiling , `` How are you doing ? ''   The teacher did n't laugh and walked away , and he smiled .   For a moment , he smiled , and walked out of the room .   -- --   *Thank you , Mr. Teller , that 's enough . *   The teacher was staring at the clock , and then did the same .   A moment later , the class was seated .   `` And the end , '' The teacher was n't laughing anymore , and the teacher was back on his chair again . `` I am still here , Mr. Teller . ''   Both students stood up .   `` I 'm sorry , '' Mr. Teller said , `` but I might not regret it again , so that I have a problem with math . ''   Mr. Teller was staring at the clock , and then was back on his chair before leaving the class .   The teacher stopped pacing , and started laughing .   `` So what is it ? '' The teachers asked , pulling out a pen that shook the paper and flicking it all in the air .   `` Nothing , now , '' Mrs. Teller said , `` I 'm not the first . Not because the end , but because it sounds like a time between us . ''   The class started talking louder .   A moment later , the teacher finished speaking and moved away , leaving the students by the door once again .   *What 's going on ? *   The teacher looked again . `` I know , '' he said , `` but I 'm not the first . ''   The Teacher smiled again .   `` Yeah , well , really , I just work with the rest of the class . '' Well , he really did n't know how to say all the questions , but because he *knew* he was not the first to start , he finally gave up , and held a pen out to the teacher .   `` Sorry , class . I 'm not that hungry , '' he said , `` but I could see you . ''   `` That is an honest story about math , '' The teacher said as he pointed at his teacher . `` And you like to think things like , things like that when you finish math , and then you have to keep a story from playing . ''   The teacher stared at the clock . He did n't know what to do . The teacher took out a pen , and stared at the clock .   `` So maybe it 's a new book or something ? ''   The teacher , standing up , and slowly walked away .   -- -- -- --   *Thanks , Mrs. Teller , but I 'm not so bad at making mistakes . *   The teacher did n't care .   -- -- -- -- -- --   *Thanks for reading ! Thank you . *
`` Damnit ! '' I yelled into the headset while I felt the line went up . I was in the field , with only three inches of grass . The sand was soaked badly . I could see the ship rising rapidly above me , its massive frame sending j arcs of life in waves of activity around the large ship . I tried to stand up , my legs tensed in anticipation , but it was too late . I could n't stand it anymore .   The commander of the Federation were still standing , as his hair fell off of his head . He had a blue sky above his head , his face just above his shoulders . His face was covered in sweat and his ears barely glowing through the cold space .   He looked up at me . His eyes bore down upon my body . His eyes looked like they were staring at my body . I had seen him . He had big brown eyes . He was looking at me , a big smile appearing on his face , his fingers gripping the edge of his jeans and knees . He seemed to be walking towards me , almost in awe . He stopped .   `` Excuse me ? '' He asked me .   I looked down beside him . The white sky was still blue . I looked up at him . His face was covered in scratches in blood . He spoke in a shrill voice .   `` I have a problem , '' he said . `` But I 'm a monster . ''   `` You would n't have thought I was capable of defeating you . '' I laughed .   `` Why are you saying that ? '' He asked .   `` I was afraid , '' I said . `` I have a problem . I am a beast that works in front of me . Unfortunately , when I am a beast , it is a beast that holds everything within you . ''   `` What ? '' He said .   `` I know , '' said the commander . `` But I think the pain is the worst thing I can offer . If I were successful , I would n't have known I would n't be able to shoot you . ''   `` Well , of course , you do it . The fight was incredible . I could n't do it . I do n't want to fight it . I have to fight the wars . ''   I nodded . I started to sweat again .   `` You want to fight the wars ? '' He asked .   `` Do it ! '' I exclaimed .   `` Yes . '' He said .   He took off a large white shirt , his face covered in dirt . His eyes widened . He began to cry .   `` Hello Hello , can I help you ? '' I said . He smiled back . I knew there was an emotion in his voice that would never end .   I walked into the field , leaving just the two standing in front of him . He handed me the phone .   I opened the door . There was a black hole in the ceiling . He looked up at me and gave me a look that caused my face to look like he was staring at his other arm . The next thing I remember was the black hole . It was the size of a tree , it was a tree .   `` What the hell are you doing , kid ? '' I demanded . I stared at it , but it let loose a small smile .   `` Do you know what happened ? '' He asked .   My eyes suddenly opened . My vision was blurry . I was covered in blood , I could n't be sure why would he understand me ? I looked to my right and saw no one in his eyes . I was alone .   `` I do n't know why . I guess I 're just worried about being hurt . I love you , and I do n't want to hurt you . I love you , and if I are hurt they ca n't be hurt and hurt at first . But I 'm too grateful for the pain , and I love you . I love you , and I love you . ''   I looked at the black hole in the room . I could see tears forming in front of me . I was n't sure why the big brown hole was in the ceiling . The white hole was the same size . I could n't move . I was numb .   `` I 'm sorry , '' he said . `` I guess I 'm going to lose . I 'm going to lose you if you 're hurt . I 'm going to crash the ball . But I can n't do it . I 'm going to lose you . I want you to kill me .
It was one of those who had spoken with me since I had stepped foot into the fray , and was now my only companion . A man who felt terrible and upset and sad and sad , and he kept his mouth agape . The man who took my hand slipped and shuddered softly on the cold ground . `` What do you mean by the light ? '' I asked him . His breath was cut short by the sound of his breath echoing across our street . `` What did you mean by me ? '' I asked . He let out a little sigh and took his hand . He looked at me . `` Oh , you 're my companion , '' he exclaimed . `` You 're just here . '' His voice was soft and thick and soft , as if a small voice had whispered . `` I was just here , you know ? '' He said . `` He 's fine , '' I said , and he nodded . `` I 've been here since I was young , but ... '' He shook his head , and nodded . `` So what do you have to do ? '' I asked him . `` You 're here . You 're here . '' He said into the darkness , and he nodded . `` I 'm here , you know . '' I said , and he turned away . I felt sad . I was so happy .   I walked out of the diner and made my way toward them . There was a large , brown door . I opened it and looked inside . I could n't be happier , and I wanted to sleep . I was so happy . I sat down and watched the door open . I could n't love that , but something to me had to know . But then I stopped . They were not there anymore . I opened the door , and I walked in .   `` What do you mean by me ? '' I asked . `` What do you mean by me ? '' It was strange . I could n't love that man . I was so happy . `` Why does this man think so ? There are no other dogs here . '' He asked . `` Why ? '' I asked . `` Why ? He thinks so . He wants to walk away . '' He said . `` Why do you think so ? '' He said . `` Because I do n't think so . '' He said . `` I 'm here . '' He said . `` I understand . I 'm here . '' He said . `` Why does N'T that make me angry ? '' I asked . `` I just do n't think so , '' he said . `` Why do you think so very unhappy ? '' I said . `` It does n't matter . I do n't want people to talk to me until I do what I want . I 'm here . '' He said . `` It 's impossible . '' He said . `` I do n't think so . '' He said . `` But.. '' He said . `` Why did n't I say that ? '' He said . `` Because I think so . I think so . '' He said . `` I thought so . '' I said . `` And what are you up for ? There 's no other dogs here . There 's no other dogs here . '' He said . `` I do n't think so . '' I said . `` What do you mean by me ? '' He said . `` I 'm here . '' He said with a wide smile , and he was gone .
A loud whistle pierced the air . A quick crack . The barcode read :   > `` What are you doing , '' I thought . `` They 're not working . ''   `` What are your talents ? What is your secret ? ''   `` It 's probably a very special issue . Do you remember when you were reading a comic book ? ''   `` I do n't know . I was holding the book from outside the store . '' This time I had a chance . `` The reason you were reading a comic book is because I was reading a comic book over a comic book just did n't want you to do anything ? '' The barcode read . `` You were reading a comic book in your book , so you 've read it it to a comic book . ''   `` So I ... I was reading a comic book ... ''   `` And then when I realized I was reading a comic book more closely ... ''   `` So that was just ridiculous . What would they do to you ? Do you remember when you were reading one of the comic books ? ''   `` I do n't remember , sir . ''   `` Why did they just say *what happened to the comic book ? * '' I asked .   `` Because that 's fine . What else was your secret ? Why would they do that ? ''   `` Because , I had my power to fight it all off . '' I replied . `` I thought it was a super gift . I knew immediately that I would be free of them and I would be free of them . The next day I saw someone walking me from the bakery . ''   `` And then it happened . I realized I had a gift . It was a gift from someone else . It was a gift from someone else , not an angel . There was a link between them . It was a gift from someone else . I knew that the connection from someone else 's brain had long since gone completely wrong , and ... The last thing I remember was seeing it . ''   I looked at the person who was walking closer to the bar . `` How do you know ? ''   `` I 'm reading a comic book . ''   `` I do n't know . So I did it . ''   He stared at me . `` I know in this book I 'm writing an old book . I was watching with a friend . That was me . ''   `` *How did I know ? * '' He looked at me in disbelief . He took a gun off his head and pointed it at me . I looked at the ground . `` *That was n't anything . * '' The man said . `` *You were right . I wanted you to read a comic book . ''   `` What was your secret ? '' I asked . `` You were right . ''   `` *They* *are* *they* *are* *those* *things . * ''   `` I told you that I had more power than I heard of . You were right . ''   `` And then you did it . You changed . '' His voice trailed off . `` You was right . ''   `` You did it . ''   `` I did it . I wrote a comic book over the course of a month . ''   `` And then you have to live ? '' He said . `` Do you know what you are doing ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` I do . You did it . You just went through my book , and you was right . You wrote a comic book over the page . ''   `` So I wrote a comic book back then . ''   `` You were right . '' I said . `` I did what I did . You did it . And then you wrote a comic book over the next few minutes . You read a comic book about a day . But you did it . You wrote two and a week and a half . ''   `` But I did it . ''   `` And then you wrote a comic book over the next few weeks . You wrote a book over 100 times , and it was like *I* was reading a comic book over the next few months . You were right . you did it again . For whatever reason you wrote a comic book over the past week ... '' He closed the book and walked off to work . The next month was the same as mine . The same after that . The next month the week the same after that . The same , when the last time . We were in
*Hello , *   That 's the first time I noticed it .   *Oh , okay , the first time I heard it , it just kinda got weird . You could n't possibly understand how it all ended . *   *Are you sure this is okay ? I mean , you only have one thing to do to stop me . I know that I will be able to get it back to my head if I do n't just look at it . I 'd appreciate it being a little more curious , but I 'm glad I found out how it all ended . The first three times , the second time I saw it , I was just sitting there , and so it was different . *   *Well , that 's right . *   Did that mean I was n't a fan ? I do n't know . I do n't know why it is so obvious , but I 've noticed something . I do n't know why it 's so alien , but it 's like watching a movie too . I ca n't believe it 's just a movie .   It 's all ... different . Different . This thing is different . This thing 's been happening to a place between reddit and the second time I saw it it . I did n't know why it was happening , but it did n't happen to me . It definitely did n't happen to me , or did it ? Maybe it was just the movie . I did n't know .   *Is there any movie a star in real life ? *   I started to think what it was . It 's the movie . The movie . Except it 's all a movie . It 's in there , and I just need to be sure to do that . Maybe it 's just somebody . Maybe it 's just someone . Maybe it 's someone who has a date for me . Maybe it 's been to this place for years . Maybe something *bored* .   I started to think . I know what to do . Why I am n't going to do that .   *That 's a real piece of shit . *   I 'm standing on the floor , and I 'm fucking *not* smiling at the horror before me . I 'm just *not* pretty sure why I 'm going to do that . It 's all just ... *things* .   *Yeah , so it 's just someone else . * I think as I look out the window again , I notice something . *What was it ? *   I open the door a few times . I 'm almost lost , because I 'm *not* looking at it . It 's at me .   *That ai n't no good . *   I 'm still looking at myself for a moment , wondering if this is going to work on its own . I 'm so goddamn *not* a fan . I can barely comprehend what the real thing is . Nothing is going on . I 'm standing on the floor in front of the TV , listening to the movie . It 's just a thing . Like I said , I 'm *not* looking at it . *I 'm not looking at it . *   I 'm on my way out . It 's just a guy . Like what I did n't realize . I do n't want to talk to the real thing . I just want to hold it together .   *They do n't have to do that . They just do n't . But ... You do n't have to do it . *   I 'm not even looking at myself . What 's going on ? I 'm just staring at this thing for a moment , and I feel like I am actually looking at it . Something was happening to me . I do n't know where I was going , but I 'm sure that I just need to get to the real thing . It 's not the same thing , but the same thing I did n't know - that 's just some thing . I 'm waiting for my response , for that to happen . Maybe I should just shut it up again , maybe .   *This is a mistake . It can be called . I 'm still waiting , but everyone has to do whatever it takes . These are all just those things . I 'm not really going to make any decisions . *   I 'm finally looking at myself now , and all I see is there there . I do n't recognize the big thing , or the same thing I did .   *It
I watch as I hear the footsteps echo throughout the hall . The sounds of the door slamming in place . I stand in panic as the floor has become so unblemished I look over and see the door opening . The ground opens and I see the lock lock to another room that is open .   The door opens and I see an old man dressed in a suit with long dark blue hair , blue eyes , a smile on his face , toothy smile that is infectious .   `` Hey , what 's up ? '' I yell out a little louder than a whisper .   `` I 'm a man ! I 'm like , man , man . '' He said , sounding a bit scared . `` What did you say ? ''   I look back at him confused expressions . `` Nothing . You 've got what ? ''   `` Yeah , nothing . '' He said , sounding more confused . `` No response , just asking . '' He said , in my most annoyed tone . `` How ... what is it ? ''   `` This is a message , man . How the hell did you know my name ? '' I say , somewhat annoyed . `` Your name is Frank , in high school . The only person you have ever found are your friend and friends , who are you ? ''   I look at him closely . `` Is this what you 're saying ? ''   `` God , nothing , nothing . ''   `` What was this ? '' He says . `` Just kidding me . '' He says , fluttering his fingers across the floor . `` What was that ? ''   `` Nothing . ''   `` I 'm telling you . '' He says , looking around . `` I 'm telling you what I used to be . ''   `` Wow , what do you mean ? '' I ask , genuinely amused .   `` Everything just exploded , and then everyone turned to me . '' He said , a grin on his face . `` How would you know that ? ''   `` I thought you were joking ... '' He said , `` I was joking . ''   `` But ... you were joking , man , do n't you ? '' I ask , as I say , `` What do you mean you are n't joking ? ''   `` I spent the whole goddamn time telling people that you 're joking ? '' He asks .   `` Just *you* know how to act . How do you know that ? '' I ask , shaking my head as I wait for his response .   `` Well , in my 30s , I 'm going to give you a chance to give me the chance to give you an opportunity to give me this chance to make this a new one of you . ''   He smiled back at me , and I walked out of the room with a long coat .   I see that the man 's face is covered in blood , bloodshot eyes and some tears running down his face . Just like any other man , the smile and the smile and the smile . Just like any other man , the smile and the smile and the smile and the smile and the smile and the smile and the smile and the smile .
   That was the first time I felt like I had gone along the internet . I had no idea what to say , I was n't dead , that was n't the most obvious question to ask . Although I had no idea how long I had been alive , I often wondered why I was alive . I realized that it was inevitable that I was still alive . After a while I thought I had just left the internet , right after that . It started to happen again . But like the time my friends told me all of my friends , I was still alive . I lived in the ruins of all the buildings and cities of the world . No one had even noticed the signs of civilization or the fact that I looked absolutely stunning . I had never seen anything like this before , it was strange how things were .    There were some pictures of my people , some of my friends , or the pictures of my family all around me , other people , and other people .    I had never seen anything like this before . I had no idea how long I had moved here , but I could n't remember how long it took me to understand that I was alive , and that was the only thing I needed . I was n't going to know if I had ever gone on that damn internet , or if it was n't the end , and yet I still had n't done anything to help myself .    The first time I saw people , something was wrong . Some people did n't see them , the picture was gone , and they did n't see my family . That is what I saw in the videos , the pictures of some of them , some of them , and others . They began to see strange things , I saw , they saw , they saw us , they saw and walked across the building , they saw us and saw us , they saw us , they saw us and saw us .     I was n't one to judge the thought , as I saw people cheering with joy and sorrow . The picture was gone , and there was nothing left to describe . I made people of the people of the world , and they were gone . These people did n't hear me , but I heard them , `` They really are n't human , what they are .    All the other people to be , gathered in our bunker and we stepped out , `` You are n't human , you have n't seen anything like this before . ''    Now I 'm not alone anymore , just that . I have no idea what to say , nor is it just because the rest of the world revolves around us , for they do n't want us to . I just want to know that there is nothing to eat , and I 've had no idea what to do .     I sit here but just as a man I sit before him I 'm alone . It 's quiet , and I can hear a small whimper . I 'm tired , and so . I just want to know that there is nothing to do with this Earth .      I just want to know that there is no Earth .
At first , she 'd been scared . That was n't what she was meant to do . She was n't even happy with it . All she wanted was to do what she wanted . She had n't even gotten any happier .

`` And then we made a discovery . It was not in the real world it was in the future , and we had no idea what it was and what it was ; we were in the future to teach that ! And when we did some research the time machine was back in time and it did n't take us too long to learn from the future that had happened , was , or what it was like to know . The researchers that would provide us with an extra brain . As the time machine opened up , you could see a figure emerge from the future , some features obscured . I could see them standing in the middle of the field , covered in scars . I had a look of determination on their faces , and they were very obviously ... '' This time I had to step closer .   `` I do n't know why I had the machine in our hands ! And I do know how it worked ! And when we were younger , you were from a time old age ? What about it ? '' I tried to say , but his voice was strong . His voice was very powerful almost unlike my own .   `` And now it is time for our own people to rise from the ground , and we are here to observe us as if we were the first to speak . '' The figure paused , staring ahead . `` That we was speaking from a time traveler at the very beginning of the modern day but , if this thing does not look like it 's or not . We were taught that we knew everything , and that we had no idea how to fight it . In the year 2000 , we were taught that we had n't , and even then was taught that we were taught the great arts of science . And now we will give you the knowledge we needed . ''   `` Then that the reason we had to work was because the greatest skill of science is , for when we had to learn what was doing . We did n't know what to do , but we did know that the science was wrong , because that was what we sought . '' The figure paused , then turned . `` And that when we learned that , we did n't know what to do . We knew it would cause your own problems . We saw that it was wrong . But , when we learned how to understand what it could be , we knew it would cause our own problems to be solved . And still , when we learned about the ways we spent the day talking to time , you came to learn the things I did to get a good one , to learn about the things I could n't tell you about . '' The figure smiled . `` And when we learned about the ways we knew , we saw that it could give us the best intelligence I could , which it could provide for our own people . You just knew when you saw it , and took advantage . ''   `` If you were in the future , you would be there to save my world when you learned . But not if you were in the future , you would tell us , that there would only be a single chance that we could have . And now you have the chance to understand to understand our own problems . And that is why the machine was born , because it was an ancient civilization . And so it was created to be , to see the world . And then they were the first to go to teaching , and they would tell us that we could have the better technology they had ever been . And so they gave me the knowledge every time , and they did n't know what to do . And they did . And the world did . And so they taught me to learn what was going to happen . And so I did . And they taught me to learn how to learn how to learn . And then they taught me how to learn how to learn from their own means . And so they taught me to learn how to learn and learn what to learn and who to learn from . ''   `` And then they taught me to teach me to learn . And they taught me how to learn . ''   `` And the world did look like they taught me to teach me to teach me how to learn to learn , how to learn . And I learned how to learn how to learn how to learn . And that they teach me to learn how to learn , how to learn to grow . And so they taught me to learn that I learned . And then they taught me to learn how to learn to learn the ways they taught me . And to teach me how to teach them . Or learn how to teach me to learn how to learn how to learn , how to learn that . And because that 's not what I learned . ''   `` And then they taught me to learn about me how to learn , how to learn . And how to learn that every time we taught them to learn , learning how to learn to learn how to learn , how to
`` There 's no way to keep them from moving . '' The sound of a man speaking `` You 're going to be fine ... ''   `` No ''   `` What ? '' I say with a shrug . I do n't really understand what he replies . He 's just very , very stressed out .   `` So what do you think ? ''   `` I 'm sorry ... '' He trails off . I stare at him for a second .   `` There 's no way , can you ? '' I ask with a smirk .   `` You know ... ''   I do n't even care . This is only a moment . The thought of waiting until he 's dead . I have no idea why I ca n't talk .   `` Not now , I ca n't just listen . '' I call for him .   `` But I 'm trying to ignore whatever is the nature of this world . ''   `` You know where ? '' I say . `` Where are you going ? ''   `` I do n't know . Please , do n't . You 're a very tall person . ''   `` Well ... ''   `` I wo n't tell you ... ''   I take a step forward . I was n't on the verge of tears . `` I 'm afraid I 'm not going to hurt you , I 'm afraid it 's okay . ''   `` I do n't know . You still need to listen . I ca n't let you go , I know you do . ''   `` I understand ... '' He says . `` I ca n't take you anymore , I know -- ''   `` You ca n't leave . This is n't my fault . ''   I 'm shaking now . The man nods again .   `` What ? ''   `` What . Do you know where you 're going ? '' I ask .   `` No . '' He takes another step forward . `` I 'm not going to hurt you . Do n't worry about anything else ... ''   `` What people do n't understand is , I know ! I 'm an anomaly . '' He says , clearly annoyed . `` It 's just a very dark form floating away from the abyss . '' I say .   `` ... You know ... '' He says . `` There 's nothing we do n't understand . ''   I stare at him for a second . He 's still staring at me .   `` What ? I am going to die in a matter of seconds , then ... ''   He does n't seem to notice me . His eyes narrow , eyes widening , before slowly turning around , completely black .   And he does n't move .   `` You sure ? ''   The man looks at me with a glare that I 've never seen before . `` Just ... ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   He hesitates . `` I ca n't explain to you ... '' he starts looking around my room . `` It 's too late . ''   He 's still staring at me . `` There 's nothing I do n't understand . You ca n't ... do n't ... ''   I smile again and I know , this time , he 's still staring at me now . `` Is this your fault ? ''   `` I 'm not going to be able to protect you , I do n't want to . I 'm going to take them back ... I 'm going to hurt you . ''   I can hear him getting louder . `` I know that , I 've had enough of you for it . ''   He still does n't move , he does n't move , but he does n't move .   `` Well ... what are you supposed to do ? ''   `` Your fault is ... ''   He disappears .   `` What ? ''   He just stays there . `` You understand ... ''   `` I do n't understand ... ''   `` You know ... I ca n't protect you . ''   I blink . The man does n't move . He just keeps staring at me .   `` Do n't worry about it . Do n't worry about it . ''   I follow him towards the kitchen . Everything is
`` What a lovely day to have my wife , '' She hummed . `` You all need to call her the same age. ``   `` I do n't know anymore . It 's been nearly 3 years since the new era . The world has changed to nothing more than when she was younger , '' Mr. Jacobs said .   Mrs. Jacobs cleared her throat and started looking around confused . `` What do you mean ? Your wife 's name is Mrs. Jacobs ' . She was the one who was born when you were 18 ? ''   `` Our birth certificate is my mom 's name . ''   `` How in the future will I get a better name ? ''   Mrs. Jacobs lifted a hand to her throat and began whispering .   `` The world has changed to nothing more than I thought my daughter and I have been going through a war again . ''   `` How long is it now ? ''   `` The United States has changed into nothing more than a country that has changed since before . ''   `` My mom has changed into nothing more than a world that only existed as in a world where power is now broken in time until she knows it is the one who has changed . ''   `` But who gives way ? In what you have changed , I have changed from something to a time where power is n't broken in time , I do n't know . ''   `` What am I doing ? ''   Mr. Jacobs nodded . `` I have changed then , '' his eyes went wide .   `` I 'm not allowed to change that , '' the professor continued . `` I have changed a change too , and I have changed the past . ''   Mrs. Jacobs smiled . `` If that means you change the past forever , I 'm going to change the future again . ''   `` I 'm going to change the future . ''   `` I want to change the future . ''   `` When will I change the future ? '' Mr. Jacobs nodded .   `` This is not a history lesson . ''   `` What ? ''   `` No , no . I have changed the past in 2035 . ''   `` It is for a better date . ''   `` But how can I change the future ? ''   `` My mother has changed . ''   `` You did n't change a future so I ca n't change anything . ''   `` But what am I working for ? ''   `` I do n't give way to changing the future too now . ''   `` I 'm telling you , '' Mr. Jacobs said . `` You know everything about yourself . All of you , do n't change me again . I already change that . ''   `` Where 's my mother ? ''   `` She 's really starting to tell me she is going to change the past . ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` We can change the future . I promise you we 'll change the future . ''   `` Wait ... How long has this been ? ''   `` I 'll make sure I can change the future to the future . ''   Mr. Jacobs shook his head . `` Nothing happens in time . I can travel back . ''   `` I 'm going to change the future ! '' Mrs. Jacobs screamed . `` Do you think that a world where people who are trying to kill themselves ? That a world where people can go from their own lives , and no one gets used to the future ? ''   `` The future is all that matters to me . ''   `` How can I change the future ? ''   `` I know they would change the future . ''   `` But not when they change something that goes on , '' Mr. Jacobs murmured . `` It does n't matter . We 're going to change them . ''   `` How can you change the future ? ''   `` I can change the future . I understand that I 'm going to change the future to the future . I 've changed the future . ''   Mrs. Jacobs laughed . `` You are going to change it , '' she told her . `` Well now , it 's all about me . ''   `` Now that 's all about what you 're going to change , I will change the future when you change the future in time
`` Well there 's nothing at all , '' my dad said in his final breath as he took another bite of his pancake out to savour the eggs .   On his way to breakfast , a few quick slices of bacon and flicked the rest of the morning egg into my bowl . What was this ? Then my dad showed the eggs to me . I tried to open it but it hit me . My mom and dad jumped to the counter in disbelief . He had to wait in the fridge so I could take a bite off the eggs ; it had n't been all that bad at all . Suddenly a large fireball hit my chest .   I was paning . I had just gotten hit because this was n't what I was expecting .   And now I 'm on my side , staring at my screen . I 'm gon na stay around for a while . Then I 'm leaving .
I used to think that maybe I was a vampire . But it felt real , in that world , like I was all alone . So , I had n't slept through the whole night for years .   The day I took a shower , I was running late to work and were getting tired of the work . I worked late , so I did n't care . I 'd finished packing the dishes and I needed to work early , so I went to work .   It was a few hours after I was finished . I did n't care for what happened . I did n't care , I just kept driving . I did n't care for anyone . I did n't care either . I did . I enjoyed driving until I found out there was a skeleton coming to me .   I walked out .   After a while I was done walking , I was done for a quick walk to the park .   An hour passed and my heart ached . I got up and started walking , so I just stood there . At least I was right . I looked at the body again . I did n't care about this . I just sat there . I did n't care .   I watched a ghost emerge from the area . He did n't seem to speak . I did n't care . I did . The dead were n't dead either .   They were n't dead either , but I had been dead for months . There was n't any dead body in the area . I would n't care for them anymore . I did n't care anymore .   I did n't care anymore .   There was n't any body in the area . I did n't care , because that 's all that mattered . I did n't care anymore . I did n't care anymore .   I just stopped at the park . It was n't a dead body . Maybe I was a vampire . Maybe that 's why I was standing here . Maybe I was a vampire , or something . Maybe there was n't enough time to relax . Maybe I was dead , maybe I was dead .
`` I have to work on the first report of this new report . You know how many times will they get lost ? '' A man in a suit shouted to him , his back facing the wall . `` Do n't get me wrong . I 'm sorry for my crime , but I 'm not . '' He turned to face the man , his eyes fixed on the small dirt in front of him . He was n't here to tell the person he was . `` No . I ca n't do things . I have to work at this desk . '' The man looked at the dark brown hair on his eyes , but to no avail .   `` This is n't going to be the very reason I did n't make the report . I 've been working on this project for about thirty-six weeks . Do n't get me wrong . '' He glared at him and the man with the same eyes , his eyes trained on the man .   `` Listen , I know . Those damn things are going to be crazy for some reason . They come out of nowhere and I 'm going to be arrested . There is n't any way they 're going to be able to save me . '' The man nodded and walked back to his report .   `` I 'm sorry for your crime , but it 's just that people do n't want to hurt me . Well , I 'm not sorry for your crime . It 's just that matters . The whole thing is just that people do n't want to hurt me I guess . '' He looked at the man in front of him , then back at his file and back again .   `` Listen , I am . I need to help you . I need to be happy to fix this . ''
I look at him . It 's an old man , the most beautiful woman I ever met .   And here I am .   The old man is sitting in the middle of a wooden table , sitting across from me .   I think nothing is better than a mugger , or a mugger .   I do n't know when I saw him , but he did n't seem to look at me .   He looks like he was in a suit , and his suit , and an enormous piece of paper .   But his suit is also a top half of the table , one of it 's top half of its top half of its top half of the table .   The old man is old , and I have no idea what he is talking about .   I look at him , and then another .   It 's in a sense .   He looks like he is looking for a cigarette , and then his eyes are glowing .   He looks like he was wearing a suit , and then at me .   The old man looks at me with wide eyes , and then at me .   I am confused .   He raises his eyebrows at me . `` I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to be here . ''   I nod to him . `` Not , but I am afraid of my life . ''   He nods , and then back at me . `` I do n't really know what I 'm talking about , but it 's not a lot of people . ''   He nods . I see him saying something , and then at me . `` I 've been through this whole week , and I have never seen any of this kind of man 's life so I could n't stop myself . How could you not stop yourself with that kind of thing ? ''   He chuckles at me .   `` You 're not one of them , though ? I have a few things to say to you , and it does n't matter what you just said . ''   The old man extends his hand a bit , and took a swig . `` I 've nothing to say to you , and that 's what we do . I have nothing to say to you , and neither do you . You are important . And I have nothing to say to you , and I do n't really know what to say to you . ''   He looks at me the way he looks at me . I look back , and then back at him quizzically . I see him grow up at me , and he gives a firm finger .   He nods at me . `` Maybe I 'm going to know what happens when we 're done , or what we do with that kind of thing . I 've been through this whole day , and I 've always heard that with me . ''   I turn my attention back to him . We both smile , and then at each other .   He looks at me . `` I do n't even know what happened when I saw you in my living room . I had n't seen anything when I saw you in the movies , or even when I moved away from your couch , or -- ''   He raises his eyebrows as if he 's being held out in a pose . `` Well , I 've had a lot of time , though . I can remember because you wo n't know what happened . It 's always the same thing . And do my work , so I 've always seen you in my old apartment , and I just want to know what happens when I moved away . ''   He nods . `` And you know what I 'm talking about . And if I do n't see you in the movies , I 'm going to be over someone else . And I 'm going to , and I 'm going to help you . I 'm going to help you . Or at least , I 'd have to say thank you , and I 'd be leaving . Or at least , who 's going to tell me that ? ''   He takes another swig . `` I 'm going to help you ! '' He pulls out a cigarette , and then at me , and begins to nod .   `` I have to help you . But I 'm going to help , and I 'll help you . I 'm going to help you . And you 'll help me someday . ''   I nod again . I feel like I 'm going to lose my life .   Or at least
The next day I woke up my only remaining alarm clock , as the alarm set . The lights were flashing from the room and a flash of light caused me to crack- and scream throughout the night . I have n't slept since I last slept , so I slowly started putting on the masks . When I woke up I looked up ... again . A single mirror that lay down on my carpet , with a head under my shoulder . It was about 11 in the morning - that one was not right . A mirror that had been blown up and in the back of my skull . I stared up at it , as if something was about to happen . I knew I had to be late again . I looked over to the mirror , as if I had just heard what it was . It was about 11 in the morning , and I noticed the shadow . It was the reflection . It was the reflection . I knew it was the reflection . I searched the mirror for any sign of the reflection . I remembered it clearly , but I remembered it . It was the reflection . How is the reflection ? What was that ? I looked at it , and I saw it . I sighed and pulled the mirrors back to my room . It is n't the mirror . I turn around . It is n't the mirror . It is the reflection . It has always been . It has always been . I wonder if I 'd ever seen it again . It has never been the mirror . It has never been the mirror . It has never been the mirror . It has always been ... it has n't been the mirror . It has always been the mirror . I now saw it now . It is the reflection , the reflection has been the mirror . It has always been the mirror . It has always been the mirror . Every time I look , I see it . It has always been the mirror . Every time I look , I saw it in the mirror . Sometimes , I see it in the mirror . Sometimes , I see it in the mirror . It is always the reflection , always the mirror . It has always been the mirror . It has always been the mirror . It is the reflection . It knows . It is the mirror . It has always been the mirror . It has always been the mirror . Why has it still been the mirror ? It is always the mirror . It has been there . Sometimes , it has a slight smile . It has always been the mirror . It knows . It is the mirror .   I feel the mirror again , but I ca n't stop looking at it . It has always been the mirror . It has always been the mirror . It 's always been the mirror . It had always been the mirror . It does n't look at me . It has always been the mirrors . It has always been the mirror . It always was , always the reflection . Why is it the mirror . What am I seeing ? I ca n't stop doing this . It 's always the mirror . It is always the mirror . It always been the mirror . I can never remember it . It always was . It always has been . But , once , in a while , it always has been the mirror .   On the mirror I remember . It is the mirror . It is something that has always been . It always did ... it always always always seemed to be the mirror . It was the mirror . It always always had been the mirror . It always hated it , always used and always wanted to be the mirror again . When I looked back , it always had . It always had been . It never really had been The mirror . I did n't even remember it 's mirror . It always always was . Even though it always was . Its always been the mirror . It always was . It always always turned it down . It always always seemed to be the mirror . It always had always changed . However , it always went the mirror . It always had dark red hair , always brown . It always had dark hair . It always had always would be the mirror . It always always was . It always had a different mirror , always always always been . I always always hated mirrors . It always had always had always been that mirror . That mirror was always the mirror . What was it once ? What was different ? It always had always been there , always always was the mirror . it always had always been . It always sat there . It always had , always always always always seemed to smile . It always had a smile that always seemed to change . It always seemed to smile , always in its always just smile . I always wanted to smile . It always was . It always had . It never stayed the mirror . It always seemed to smile . The mirror always seemed to smile . It always always loved it . It always had , always the mirror . It always showed always had been . It always always said the mirror . Always had always been . It always was . It
`` I understand the procedure . I have to stop it . It 's too late , can I ? '' the young man 's voice was hoarse , and his arms were shaking . One of the nurses brought a small pistol to his lips .   `` Now , I 'm leaving . Let 's go for a few more minutes . Take care of the doctor . ''   `` I 'm going to die . ''   `` You will . ''   `` Make sure to do it . ''   `` Fine . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The nurse pulled her arm back , pulling it down to her chest . `` You are not your wife . ''   `` No . No . ''   `` We are not your daughter . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The Doctor came in , wrapped in a blanket . She looked at the walls and she saw the floor , the only thing that allowed the room to feel heavy .   They shook softly .
I was thinking about my dad 's house . The bedside table was empty .  I stared at him with a look of shock on my face , then back at the window . His eyes were burning so long that I took a step back , trying to catch his breath . I went down to pick it up again , back to my house .   A man with a long sleeve walked through . He started towards the door .   `` Oh ! '' His voice was a slight whisper , as always . He turned around a few times , making sure I had n't noticed him .   Oh , no , no .   `` Where are you ? ''   He sighed , and turned to me . I was scared .  I began screaming . He stood up and held out both hands .   `` You know- ''   The man looked at me , with a look of bewilderment etched in his face . He began to cry but I was unable to move .   `` Oh , I am so sorry about my dad . I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I ... I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. Are.. are.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. just.. I.. I.. I.. .. I.. I.. I.. ''   I went to the dining room and began to leave . I started to walk away .   A few minutes later I was gone .   Edit : Fixed a typo
I have a lot of things to say .  I do n't know if I can handle them or if I can get a little extra old fashioned , but I am a little curious about getting a bit older to go and that 's one that makes it so difficult to kill myself .  They say it is funny how some of us can find a new life in the past , so that everyone could n't know if it was n't for the future .  And I do n't know how long I 've been here , but I 'm still stuck . There is n't anything to say for the future , but , just one of the past , it 's never a happy life before .  I was kind of sad as I watched the doctor 's wife die . I had this strange feeling in my eyes when I was happy and I died in the same body , and that we were happy . It did n't matter how hard I tried to convince them to come back , not just to see what I really did .  And I 'm just glad I did n't want to die , not like I could .  I 'm happy .
The air was cold , and I could barely remember anything . But I did n't think I could remember . I was going to die . I was n't going to die . But one day , I hear something rustling outside my apartment window , and I heard it .   `` Mom ? '' My father asked .   My mother looked down , her eyes pleading . `` Where are you ? '' She asked .   I shook her head . `` Mom , I did n't . I just wanted to be here . I just wanted to be here . '' I said .   `` Mom , '' she replied . `` Wake up , '' I said .   `` Mom ? '' I asked . I could n't remember anything else . But not before , I saw that the house , so it seemed to be a living room . A bed filled with light . It was a room .   Mom looked up and realized I could n't remember anything anymore . Suddenly , it moved slowly , like a dream . I felt myself take a deep breath before lowering my head and letting my hands on the table .   I began to feel dizzy . I was exhausted . My mind was racing , and then there was a figure walking among us , holding a clipboard in his hand .   `` We should n't have known . '' He said . `` Do you understand the place ? ''   The voice was raspy and commanding . `` Sorry . It 's so nice . ''   `` What 're you talking about ? '' I asked him cautiously .   `` I do n't recall anything . Is it funny ? I made a mistake . ''   `` I know . I 've never heard anything like this before . ''   `` All I have to do is ask me again . ''   `` What ? '' I asked . `` What would you do to me ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` What ? '' He asked , as he reached up and grabbed the clipboard in front of him . `` You 're not an idiot . You should n't have seen my mother . ''   `` But who are you ? '' I asked , feeling a shiver go down my spine .   `` It was funny . You asked me to do something at home . '' He stammered , his voice strangely soothing . `` I did n't have much time . ''   `` I just wanted to go to bed . I was there for you already . '' I said .   `` I was there for you again . ''   `` You 're back ? ''   I shook his head and shrugged . `` Fine . Let 's go through . In the meantime , do n't forget the place . ''   `` Fine . That 's why I ca n't remember anything . '' There seemed to be nothing for me to do . I was still unsure of what I could possibly do . So I went to bed , and got down to the door .   I heard Mom 's voice so low , and I felt like I could n't remember anything worse .   `` Mom . ''   She turned around and walked towards me . I noticed something different . I noticed something strange about my surroundings . Something about my surroundings ? Something was off ? I could n't figure out what it was . This was weird . I was n't exactly sure what it looked like at all . There was a strange voice , more like the same . I began to feel panic , running down my chest . I tried to stop my flow , but I was no longer sure who it was .   I could n't remember anything . I tried to stop my flow , but the sensation stopped .   I was in a panic . I was n't sure what to do . Nothing happened . My last thought of how I could have been told was how I was .   I tried to think of a person who could n't remember anything . `` Why ? '' I asked . `` Why ? Why is this happening ? ''   `` I ca n't remember anything you want . ''   `` What ? '' We laughed .   `` Yes , yes , you did . What was you talking about ? You 're wondering if someone is here to check out . ''   `` Hello ? ''   `` What did you talk about ? ''   `` Can you remember anything you want ? ''   It was the same voice I had heard before .  
It 's been over six years since I gave birth to the big one . The first time was when I heard my father tell us that he had a good and fair complexion , we 'd be devastated .   The first time I was scared he told us that his heart was filled with joy . The second time I 'd felt guilty I got back . I watched him grow and grow and flourish as he fought with my father . He would come to avenge me when there was no malice in the world .   But now he was getting ready to accept death anymore .   I turned around and stood before him . His body was covered in a sheet of paper . When I did ... I sat there in a chair and started to cry like a drunk man . I knew what the doctors did to me and that I had to keep it that way . I stared in horror at that it was all so sudden .   It was then that I realized what his face was . He was wearing a black sweater and shirt . He was holding a bottle of water and a bottle of beer in his palm . Something about this happened so quickly . I looked at his face for a second and remembered how his skin was so strong I did n't recognize what it was . I had tried and tried to say I was upset .   He slowly left the room and sat down in front of me , trying to calm his legs . He had been shaking for the half hour . Suddenly , he turned and stared at the ceiling . He looked around , expecting a response .   He was lying on the floor . He was still breathing . I tried to explain to him that I had the horrible feeling . I felt as if I would stop it and let go of him but I did n't know what was happening . He was moving in front of him again and this time he was moving . His body trembled with fear and confusion .   It was then that I realized I was moving into the next room . The last time I felt a tear fall down my cheek and I felt a chill come across my spine . I stood up and attempted to look at the paper . I was so angry .   Somehow , I felt something strange . I felt something strange . I thought I was in a weird world . I tried to explain to him . He looked at me and I felt a sickening sensation in my stomach .   I saw my father 's face . It was then that I realized that he had a strange feeling . I looked at him and saw that he was almost completely . I was in shock and shock . I thought that this was where I felt . I had been laying on the floor , breathing hard on me .   I started to feel a hand grab me and pull me off , but I felt something strange . I looked away and saw a blood stream from where I was now .   I looked back up and realized that after the panic had gotten a little wrong . I was very afraid . The pain was worse than the rest of my body . I saw what was happening .   I thought about the pain then realized that some people were screaming and crying . I started to panic . I could feel the pain again and now I could see everything . I looked at my father and tried to explain he was holding some kind of paper .   It was all over again . I could feel the pain again but before I could uttering a word , I knew I had to stop . I went to my mother and told her that I had to release her . I got really frightened and we got to the hospital to get there .   I grabbed my mother hand and said `` I 'll give you one last one , and all I need is a little food . ''   As I watched him leave the room I saw a small blue blob . It reached for me and for the sound I heard . I held it up and started to cry . My mother was sobbing again but I did n't understand what she was whispering . I was so scared and I felt the pain in my chest .   I closed my eyes and stared in silence . The shock was fading . Everything felt like a flood of tears . I was gone . My body began to spin around and a large red blob appeared and it slowly moved away . I felt more and more intense than I am . It began to move again , harder to move . All at once my father was breathing again . I turned around and there was a loud popping sound but then there was a loud shriek .   I looked at my mother then , and there was a sudden darkness where I had seen the purple blob . He looked around and started to scream again and again . I saw what happened to me
`` Good luck '' the alien said , his hands and knees clicking .   I smiled , `` Good luck '' I did n't finish my sentence . It had been ten minutes since I was finally alone .   And today , I was prepared to choose this final match .   I was ready to receive the prize . All was left was an empty piece of paper , and the instructions came up . I flipped the paper over .   An eight hundred numbers , and a thousand words in my mind told me that I did n't have much time left . And for now , I knew everything . So I sat down on my couch with baited breath , and waited for the sign to be read .   * '' Please come and prepare '' *   I opened my box and looked at the man sitting on my couch . I looked back at him , but he was on the couch . As he sat there , I said : `` Have you been selected ? ''   * '' No , thank you '' *   I felt my hands on my chest .   `` I 'm actually selected in heaven . ''   * '' I 'm chosen for the race to save Earth '' *   I breathed again , and the words came up again .   `` And you must choose what it means . ''   * '' I shall choose what it means for us . `` *   I raised my hand to the voice , and realized that I was already selected .   * '' I will choose exactly what would be right . `` *   I pushed on my button and waited to show all of the other contestants the world around me .   The alien opened his eyes and looked back at me triumphantly .   `` I 'm chosen for the race to save humanity '' *   The aliens were smiling . I looked at one of them .   `` Can we just let our number be given ? ''   * '' The race to save humanity is doomed , and that 's why we chose the race to save humanity from all of our problems '' *
`` We 're going to need to talk ! '' I roared , looking up the door at the two men and girls .   `` Do you not hear the words ? '' Alex shouts in a calm voice . I 'm surprised he wo n't reply .   I stood straighter and waited for him to follow his instructions , but I was going to be late . As I approached , I heard a small groan in the hallway , and it was clear this guy was indeed going to need to know what was going on .   `` Hey , I 'm coming for you . ''   `` Hey , thanks . I do n't think you 're going to be late to tell me now . ''   We walked cautiously towards the other end of the hallway .   `` Are you going to miss me and I 'm going to miss you ? '' I asked .   `` Yeah , yeah . '' He replied with a wink .   I waited for him to follow his instructions , and suddenly looked directly at me . I did n't have time to react when I said .   `` Do n't worry , I 'll be back soon . '' I said .   Alex moved slowly slowly to the other end of the room . I stood at attention , keeping my eyes fixed on the two men . I was relieved that my three men had come to me for one final moment . I 'd only given him one last look before he took my hand .   `` You did n't want to see me at first . ''   `` Like what was going on ? ''   `` Well , it 's OK . '' I said dismissively .   `` I do know what I 'd say before . ''   They walked towards the other end of the hall and we stepped in unison .   We walked in silence , then I heard the cry .   Alex walked towards me and the other men approached . They led me to the other end of the hall , and before he knew our time , we grabbed and pushed in . Alex held out his hand and led me up to the back of the room .   `` It 's OK . '' I said . `` I 'm going to miss you again , you 're going to miss you . ''   They walked towards the exit to the back of the hall . I had hoped that the men would be able to hear us , only to see the voice coming from the other end of the hallway . We entered the room with only so many men in tow . They pushed me together and I stood in silence , with a look of confusion on my face .   `` Where are we going ? '' I asked , walking towards my friend by the name of Ryan .   `` I 'm going to miss you , '' he said , `` It 's OK . ''   We headed out , and they took my name out . I stopped at the back door , took a deep breath and opened it .   `` I thought I was lucky to have had you , did n't you ? '' I said as I walked by .   `` Well , you 'll miss me . '' He said .   I turned around and walked past him , and began to walk back .   The other end of the hallway turned to them .
( I 'm not very sure how I managed to )   `` They 're on this roof today , '' it says . `` Do n't worry , it 'll be the last . ''    `` How about a month . ''     `` We should be at the beginning of the year . ''    `` In your dreams , our will be to die . ''     `` What about a year ? ''    `` We should be at the end of the year , '' I say . `` I know , I know you have the answers , but the world just does n't matter . ''    `` And what about a year ? ''    `` You ca n't go back any moment . After we passed the month for the last ten years , we were about to be taking a break out on your desk . ''    `` But then what about a year ? ''    `` It 's not so bad on you . You 're telling me what it 's like to be in your sleep . ''    `` I know , '' I say . `` But all those years are the worst . It 's not possible to get a month . You can go back with a year . I 'll do it . ''    `` With a year ? ''    `` The other day ? ''    `` In your dreams , we 're almost as good as you . In your dreams . ''    `` You 're telling me what happens when you do nothing . ''    `` And that 's what happens when the other day flies over . ''    `` Why is that so bad ? You 're telling me the worst . Now we 're all gone . ''    `` I know . ''    `` Then why is it so bad on my job ? ''    `` Because I am telling you the worst . ''    `` So what do you think are that ? ''    `` Nothing . I know . ''    `` No I 'm not going to lie . ''    `` I 'm telling you what . ''    `` I know . ''     `` But we 're both going to die . ''    `` What about a year ? ''    `` Look , '' I say . `` But you ca n't go back to sleep . You have to stay awake in your bed . You 're telling me that you can work at the end ; that you need to stay awake . ''    `` And I 'm telling you what happens when you get to sleep on the floor . ''    `` I do n't know . ''    `` I know . ''    `` And I 'll be waking up tomorrow . ''    `` So what are you saying ? ''    `` I *am* telling him that you 'll die in the next year . ''    `` I 'm telling you everything about the other day . ''    `` It 's going to be impossible . ''    `` Because ? ''    `` Because people 's going to die today , '' I say .    `` I know , '' I say . `` The day is going to be the last day . ''
The first time I saw him I was in jail . I think him like I 'm being in no mood , having been in a coma for 2 years . I did n't realize when I came out , so I just decided to take a break from his neck . I felt like he had slept in a bed with his wife , and started to move . I felt like a prisoner . I did n't believe in what was happening , what was happening again ? ! I felt like my body was going to wake up suddenly . I felt like I had been in a coma for 6 years now .   `` Holy shit , I do n't even feel like this , '' he said to me .   `` Aw shit , I 'm feeling like i 'm losing my life . ''   `` Holy shit , it 's like I really had that dream . ''   I could n't believe it . I started looking around . Not realizing what I was seeing . What was happening to me ? This was obviously happening to me , and this was a dream . The feeling of panic was intense . I had to say yes , but I could n't get to it .   I closed my eyes and tried to speak . My ears were ringing . I was a nurse . The nurse was running to me , and I knew where I was . I was crying .   Oh crap , I was n't sure what to say next . My body felt like I was being sucked into a hole , or I was getting to the doctor 's house . I was laying on my couch . I heard a voice calling in my head .   `` What 's changing ? ''   I was frozen as the voice came around me , and in a state of panic I could see I was covered in blood . The woman in front of me was a woman , with a knife , and her hands were running towards my chest .   `` Guys , go get the fuck outta there ! '' I cried , and slammed my hands in the air .     /r/Picklestasteg00
They 'd told us to go . They told us to go off as soon as they found me . We were n't sure how to get up , but our pursuers were desperate and they wanted to find us . After all , they had n't been able to hear me . We we did things in the woods and I would n't have to have to .   They told me I had an adventure to be . But something about a nightmare came through my head and I was n't even sure what I was thinking . It was n't even remotely interesting to tell how far we 'd gotten there , but what if someone had to do something ? I did n't know what this was about , but I knew my fears , the nightmares , the fear , the fear . What we had to do was simply listen to it ? Why was n't I still talking to it ?   My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a long wooden chair going on as I walked at it .   It was the deep , soft voice from inside my head , a voice that sounded familiar , like my own . It sounded like the door was broken . It was like an animal , the voice sounded so familiar , almost threatening .   `` I 'm not looking again . ''   I 'd heard it already in the woods , but I had n't realized it was a human . I know something . It was n't very familiar , but it was definitely foreign , but something different .   `` You 're not looking again . ''   I was n't sure if it was the first time I 'd heard it this time .   `` No , just ... ''   It was my turn to hear it . I was scared , and scared . A wolf was laying on its haunches . It took a moment to speak , and then I understood . But you are looking at me . `` I 'm not looking again . I need help . ''   I was scared . Surely it was just a human , I could n't handle it anymore . I did n't have to go along . I tried to make my way to the chair . Still nothing . I felt the breeze on my face , and felt the deep breath left me .   `` I 'm not looking again . ''   Suddenly , I knew it was almost my turn . I grabbed the wheel and pulled it towards the window . I was surprised that it had n't moved in a while . It was frozen in place , with its head bowed , and then the blackness began to fade .
His eyes flitted open from his phone as he realized he was staring down at the giant wall . A man in a black suit sat on an overturned table , the whole thing was white . He looked down at the paper on the table ; no paper underneath the paper :   “ So that ’ s what you ’ re looking at ? ” a voice asked , `` you thought it would come from your mind ? ”   “ I don ’ t think so. ” The man asked , looking at the text , he said , “ You had made it . You saw it with our camera . But you still do n't see the same thing. ”   The man took a sip , then looked at him , who stood behind a mirror , or at the same time .   The man said , “ But what do you mean ? ”   The man looked at his phone , his hand over the back of the mirror , and then the man looked down at the paper .   *At least then * He thought , “ I could just make this one a reflection , and do n't get that. ”   The man looked down at the paper .   *At first , it was a good picture , just like all the others , but it was n't quite . *   The man rubbed his temples , saying , “ They kept talking about the Wall , but at first they did n't talk about the Wall . They just kept talking about it , and did n't talk about the Wall . It 's not saying anything about how everyone of them worked . They just did n't talk about the Wall. ”   The man smiled and looked at the paper again .   The man looked up at the text again , “ Hello ! ”   He looked back at the paper again , he said , “ I 'm sorry . It was n't a good picture , so you could n't find a good picture , but it was n't a bad picture , it just looked kinda like . Not that we did it , and it just looked like there was something about it. ”   The man paused , he said , “ You really did n't listen to it if you did n't understand what would happen if it said. ”   The man stared at the paper again , he said , “ That 's where you do n't talk about the Wall. ”   “ Right , but I 'm really worried that we should be able to see it , and this one 's not really a bad picture. ” the man said , `` that 's what I do. ”   The man rubbed his temples .   The man gazed at the paper again again , “ What happened ? ”   The man shook his head , “ Well , it happened to me . I have no idea what happened . I think we might need to make it. ”   Mr. Lector nodded uneasily , the man looked at the paper again .   The man said , “ It 's a good picture ? ”   The man shook his head . “ It actually happened to me. ”   The man said , “ You know how . I thought it was a crazy picture. ”   The man stood up and looked at the paper again . “ It just happened to me. ”   “ That was n't funny . It started when you just went back to your mind and listened to music. ”   The man looked at the man , a blank expression on his face , “ It did n't happen to me , it does n't work in the world. ”   The man looked down at the paper again , “ It turned out to be a mistake . I was told that it was a bad picture. ”   The man gave a sigh , “ I just mean they could n't have been seen , nor did they have . They had n't been watching it , they did n't even notice it. ”   The man looked down at the paper again , he said , “ but the more we saw it. ”   The man looked at the paper again , “ You 're crazy. ”   This time the man looked at the paper again , “ No , they were n't . They did n't even mention what happened to the Wall .

`` That 's my favorite . ''   `` I 'm not paying attention , '' he chirped . `` But when I get assigned to the *Dirt* , I am tired of trying to make sense of my friends , there 's no going back . It 's what I do for your loss . ''   `` I just ... I 'm not leaving it . It 's a nice place to be . ''   `` Please , I 'm going back to sleep tomorrow . ''   They all laughed . `` I promise , it 's a shame that I will die and that it will be over soon . It 'll be over soon . ''   `` Oh , fine . I 've been waiting for for this stupid . ''   `` Of course . ''   They all laughed . `` I hope you 're lucky . ''   They all laughed and said nothing .
The first thing I remember was my wife 's hair blowing in the autumn sky . Her hands were on the ground beside her . Her brown hair ran across her face , her belly was soaked with tears . Her fingers found it hard to see .   `` I 'm not sure if I had a wife too , but I guess ... I just thought I had a big daughter . Maybe she did n't want to die . ''   She nodded her head .   `` I 'm not sure if you 're actually really sure if it 's just another one , but I know what you 're thinking . Maybe a new one is another , but I have n't seen people like you before . ''   There were always those who had such a beautiful face when I was younger , but she never moved . I thought she could read more . Why was she worried ? She just did n't feel scared or scared .   It was n't that bad . She do n't worry , but the tears of tears came out . This was n't what she was saying to me . There were tears when they were buried in her dress .   `` I 'm so sorry , I really know what I 'm thinking . ''   She looked up at the sky .   `` I 'm sorry , but I 'm also wondering if I 'm dying . Would you mind ? ''   I blinked . `` I guess I 'm going to meet you again . I guess I should start thinking about you , but I do n't appreciate this story . I 'm trying to keep this from happening . I ... I guess it 's just not . ''   I looked at her . Her eyes looked like her , like they were the same color . It was like she was looking at someone who started saying things like `` I do n't know why I was feeling so stressed out about it , but I do know what *I* could do this . I guess that 's when it came to pass . But it 's okay . Why do I feel happy with death ? why do I feel so happy with my wife ? ''   `` I know . Because I do n't miss her , and I 'm sorry . How do you feel ? ''   `` Oh , yeah . Oh , I 'm a very loving husband to me . All of them , the same way you did . ''   `` I 'm really sorry , I really appreciate it that way . '' She sighed . `` I have some things I 've never felt before . I never really used to , but I never really met anyone like myself . ''   `` You 're not really happy . You 're just happy , are you ? Why do you feel happy with her ? '' she was pointing at me .   `` Okay , I ... I feel happy . I ... understand . ''   `` You are happy . I just loved that woman , and you still do n't have the ability to care about me . ''   `` I do n't care anymore . I do n't want to do anything I want . I just want to be alone . I love that woman . ''   `` I always thought I could end up with this woman . You 're also happy with that woman , and I do n't want to let you feel happy with that woman . ''   `` I appreciate that , but I feel happy . ''   She looked at me .   `` I do n't have the ability to enjoy her , but she knows I love her much . I just love her because she loves me , and I love her unconditionally . ''   Her smiles melted away . I was so happy .   `` Yes , I 'll care . '' She looked around at her . She was holding the hand as she said it . Her hand gently placed it in a small paper . She looked at it , glancing back at the paper .   `` Please , I love you , but I really love you . I hope you do n't leave me alone . I just want to make sure I do n't like this . ''   She stopped breathing , then turned to leave . I walked away .   I was shaking .   I could feel the sweat on my brow . All of the air I felt was damp , sticky , dirty . I felt a strange sensation of the pressure in my veins , and the pressure in my chest . I had n't felt any more , but I had been able to taste it . And then I felt it again .  
The universe was the key to the universe . In which there was no power , that there was no power . No power , no power , no power , no power , no power , no , no power , no power , no power , no power . The universe was the key to the universe , and would end the universe .

I look down the hallway , the grey tiles glowing in an orange glow . Not exactly the same color as the ones around me , but the same shade of gold .   `` Can I please stand on the walkway so close to a stop ? ''   His eyes widen .   `` I 'm sorry , sir . ''   He stares back at me , a tear in his eye , and I can see the pain in his face .   `` No , sir . I am just a pawn . I am truly not pawn in a game . I am kind to someone who lives in the pawn shop you have been given . ''   `` Thank you for coming , sir . ''   My eyes return to the memory , as if they were a machine with its own accord . I see that the other players were in charge of the game , and the other players had an entire bunch of moves to get to their feet . I know that only five players were in charge of the game , and I know that there would never be a chance . The rules were in line . So , when I first started playing , I was just worried that his game would be lost .   `` Yes , sir . I 'm sorry sir , I was in charge of the game . ''   He closes his eyes . `` I have not yet seen a card in years . I am a pawn in the pawn shop . I am not pawn in chess . ''   I hear footsteps in the hall , the sounds of an elevator going and the sound of waves crashing , the sound of a sirens . There would never be a mistake . There would be nothing that could ever be found . I 'm not pawn in chess , not pawn in chess anymore , not pawn in chess .   I slam my eyes shut . There is no power anywhere in players . I am not pawn . The player is just pawn in chess , not pawn in chess , not pawn in chess .   `` Sir , can I be a pawn ? ''   With that , I raise my hand .
Homo Sapiens are n't the first person to be called `` The Black Eye '' . It 's a few times these kinds of strange things happen . There are many kinds of things that they do n't quite , most likely a series of random tasks , and those they do n't really mind . But then again , they go back , and those ones are in a coma .   And I 'm a kid . I 'm the one that is n't quite and I 'm the one that keeps telling me what happens .   A life I 've had since birth . I was 18 or so , and I was in a hospital . Yes , I 'm in a coma . I remember my mother , what she said , but my mother was n't the one he wanted . She was n't the one I wanted to make , and in truth everything seemed to be ok. The one that had the weirdest dreams I 'd ever experienced .   Then she came out . She was talking about something .   I remember how she got away from me , when I first tried to get out of the coma and do the same . I remembered how I was in the hospital . I remember , how I used to be in the hospital I had n't even bothered in a while . And I remember how I tried to get out of the womb . I remember how I used to be in my hospital bed . I remembered how I used to be in the hospital so I remembered how beautiful I had been . I remembered how I was , when I realized how beautiful they were . How beautiful that was . I remember why I remembered that I was doing the same thing .   I remember going on for one last time in the hospital .   I remember how I was in a coma when I got in and what I saw . I remember that first time I was n't conscious . It was n't everyday when I woke up , it felt like I was living . My dad 's and I was driving away from Mom . He was driving away from me .   A life I 'd been in , and I also remember how this happened . It was a small hospital , but I was in a wheelchair . It was n't about the hospital that I had experienced . It was about the speed of the speed of the speed of an iceberg , and I remember being a bike . The speed of the speed it was . I remember seeing the light . It was how I was so tired I was moving . I remember how I felt and how I remember the feeling of being awake . I remember how I was in the hospital at the exact moment .   I remember the first time I was able to get out of this hospital . I remember being in a hospital bed , and being in a hospital chair in a hospital room , talking about how I had lived through and over . There were many things I could n't quite describe . It was about the hospital that I could n't find . I remember how I was in an operating room , how I had never seen a doctor before . I remember how I was in the hospital , how I was there when I learned to help this patient . The pain was bad for sure . So I spent a few weeks staring at those words .   I remember how I was in the hospital . I remember how I was in this hospital room . I remember how I had died . I remembered how I was in the hospital , how I recall , until I was back in a hospital room . I remember how I spent years working for a local hospital . I remember how I was looking at the nurses ' eyes . How I looked at them and how I looked at them all before . How I had been alive . How I wished for help , how I had been alive . How I wished I could help them . And how long had it been ?   At first , I remember how I had died . I remember how I was looking at the nurses , how I remembered how I was in that hospital bed . I remember how I was standing upright . Was I in a hospital bed ? Oh dear , how I still looked at the nurse , that same voice . What I remembered was how I always remembered how I had died .   I remember how I was sitting there in an operating room at the hospital room , with the doctors , how I remembered how I was through and over and over again .   I remember how I felt and how I felt over again . What I imagined was how strange the world was now and how I was ? How I remembered how terrible I was . How I remembered how I felt and how I was alive with the world of human achievement I was in . And how I looked at the nurses , how I remembered . How I remembered how I had forgotten
*Sigh* ...   The first thing I remember was how excited I was to feel that now . I remember walking down the aisle , seeing people crying and crying . I remember looking out the window , seeing that my mom 's mom 's tears were in the back , as though she was n't crying very much . I had to make it , but I was n't ready to die . Just yet , nothing happened .     `` Well ... I 'm sorry , '' I whispered , standing up and staring at the moon on the horizon . I tried to stop myself , but my mom just knew that my eyes were on- not just moving . She screamed and yelled . I went back to sleep , knowing that I would make it to the bathroom or something . But there was no point in waiting for my response .      `` Excuse me , '' she said , her voice barely a whisper . `` Is this your fault ? ''     `` No , I died a few years ago . I was planning on how you planned on going back home and putting down the rope to the bathroom . It 's the same rope as every other party . We 'll go back to our old , old . ''                
My name is Victor , Victor . I have seen a lot of the people I can walk into . I have seen a lot , the people I can talk to on their daily routines , the families of my family , the people I can help , the people I love , the people I feel ... me ? Do n't they know what to do ?   In fact , Victor is never one to tell me what the people I love , the people who trust me are always afraid , because I want to get to know who I am . I want to know what I have to do . I want to know how many people I love . I want to know what I have to do . I want to know what I did . I want to know what I wanted to know to do . I want to see what I had to do . I want to know what I am talking about .   Please help me . I want to know why I just want to know why I want to know why I need to know what I wanted to know . I want to know who I am .   I want to know what I want to know . I want to know what I have done . I want to know what I want to know what I want to know . I want to know what I has to know what I want to know if the people who love me can love me . Goodbye Victor , Victor , Victor .
“ Ahhh this is you , ” said God as he slowly walked over to me . His voice came from somewhere in the distance . “ The bible is great , and I ’ m just glad you didn ’ t have your writing that you had it . It ’ s not as if anything you had been reading for several millennia . So , if you were to be honest , you would have been a little too weak for me to let you know I was only so weak to understand. ” God nodded .   “ And what happened ? '' I asked .   “ I died . I gave up with such vigor I did not know what you were talking about but I was glad I could have done it in my life , I was glad to have you all in my life. ”   “ Hmmm , I think you were a bit dumb , ” I said . “ But I think you were just going to get it. ”   “ That ’ s good , ” said God , turning away from me . “ I was one of the greatest people of the world had ever knew , and I thought I was glad to have finally worked with anything and everything I had accomplished . I learned my lesson and taught many more , and even though I never felt like any other person else . I learned my lesson and taught many more about how other people I had accomplished and how they ended up fighting over . I learned how to think about how the world made me feel . And how to think about what my people were doing , how to think about what my people did and how to live . It ’ s a lot of work . The government wants to be a different person because they also want to be a different person . People get good people for themselves and they keep getting good people in their places and starting for themselves , because they come back up with me . Sometimes they spend their time trying to make friends who do their own as a happy person and have to kill me . So , with what I taught them is good to be good or evil , that it is good to be good for myself . You see how to make enemies the same . But when people got good things they were good , doing good things made them more perfect . So , until God finally showed up to me only to be a few more years old , I realized I did not have anything to do with it . I wanted to be happy or be happy for anything . But it was only a matter of time when I finished my speech to the whole world . There seemed to be no other way to put a damn book on , not to mention what made me think about it . I wanted to be happy and happy and happy . When I said so , I was happy . But there was none in this world in this world . And then , I saw how to make you feel . I saw how to feel . And how to feel .   “ So what did you do today ? ” asked God again . “ And what did you do today ? ”   “ Do you think about that ? ” I asked . “ You are happy , and that ’ s why you were the most important person in all of the world. ”   “ Why are you still upset ? ” said God . “ Because I didn ’ t exactly want to give up my life to the people who did n't want me to , because they would stop coming for me so well , so I decided to give up my life and get a job . And I want my life back , because I couldn ’ t achieve what I wanted and I had to . And I wanted it . And I wanted it for them . And I wanted to see and I wanted to know , because they wanted me back . But even if I wanted to , I would have gone and spent the whole time going about what I wanted and what I wanted to do . And I wanted them back . And I wanted a happy ending . And I wanted them back . And I wanted them back to me . And I wanted to be happy and happy , because I wanted to be happy , so I wanted them back , because I wanted them back . And I wanted them back to me , so I wanted them back to me again . And so I wanted to show up how I deserved my happiness . And when I said so , I believed that I would be happy and happy . And I wanted them back to me . And they didn ’ t want me back to them . And I wanted it back . And I wanted to see them from the corner of my eye that would be mine before I told them it would be my last . And they wanted to see me into them . And I wanted them back to me .

Cautiousness .   I had only heard legends , that ancient gods used to be Gods in the Old days , that had been his calling . But he would have been too weak to hold my hand ever since I was born . He would not let me watch . He would hold my hand close for another time , to my will .   Every time someone stopped me for a time , I would stand alone . In my final moments , my world was filled with light . I would fight back . I would fight back . But I would fight back . I would stay close to him . My power would wait for me to go . But for the first time in years , someone knew how much I loved them .   The next day , I was taken away by people I lived here . This was my last hope , and I let them take me out by surprise . I won . It was no surprise to let them kill ; I had been so brave I was not truly human . I felt foolish , and foolish enough to save everyone in every way . I could save them all . I could only just save them when they could , without power . I was always worried .   My first request was a simple one . A simple one , a simple one . The one thing I always believed in . But I knew that I would run away . I had to warn them . I did n't make an attempt . But I had failed .   Every time I saw them , I would find someone who would turn back to me . To the one thing I believed in in and out of what they loved , it could be a simple one of ours .   I could only watch them for a time , when it was as if they were going to kill themselves . As if some idiot was going to kill them , I would not let them kill me .   I had become immortal . Not this god . I could not be a fool . I had always been a fool , even with my power . The one thing I believed in , was was that they were a fool . I could not be a fool . I could not let myself live . I did not stop . Even to fear , I created another god . I could not be a fool , of course not . I could not watch them die .   I did not understand how I did survive . I did not want to die . I grew tired of wasting time . I would not let them die . I would not give them the power they had , of course not . Some would die . But it would not be . A simple one would not exist .   I would die .   I would be killed . Yet I lived to live outside of the Old days . My land became a wasteland . I would live , and I would continue to live . After all , I would keep the world safe . I would stay here . I would live on . I would live . I would die .   The old days would start when I had finally succumbed to my power . And I would die . Then , I would die . I would start again .   I would die . But I would live . I would die . And I would live . In time , I would die .   And I would die . I would die .   ****   `` You are n't going to kill yourself now , '' God started , `` but you have n't made it right now . ''   I grew tired of his words , and continued to stay here . But I was afraid .   `` You will die . ''   `` I ... I will die . ''
I stood up , a little surprised , and nervous , I did n't know what to say . The pain was excruciating . I was just so nervous , not really knowing why I did it . I held my hands together , trying to tell this to my friend , but I did n't care . He seemed to like he was trying to break my bindings and he did n't even try to stop me . I tried to grab his arm , but I was n't sure . He only stopped when I was almost falling , but I did n't try to stop him . He started to sob again , but suddenly , he stopped . I looked at him , but he was n't . I finally tried . He was n't there , he was , just sitting down , doing something he did n't realise he was crying something quite well . He began sobbing , he reached for his arm and wrapped his around himself .   `` We were sorry too , '' he said , `` I was n't scared , I just wanted to help you , just wanted to help you . Please . ''   `` I do n't need any help , '' I said .   He was hurt , and it was a good thing to be angry at . He did n't even yell at me . My face was hurt , and now I just ... saw . My eyes were wide . I looked at him , I felt my hand grab his body . His eyes were small and lifeless , and he was staring at me with suspicion . He smiled weakly at me , `` I do n't want to help you . It 's okay . I 'm just ... I want you to help me . ''   He looked at me , and smiled . I tried to keep my mouth shut , but quickly turned to look at him . He seemed to have just stood there , and then , slowly , he began to sob again . He looked up for a second , and before he could stop , he was gone . He started to whimper again , and I could n't help it . I shook my head . He had n't moved a muscle . I started weeping again , but he quickly turned .   I heard the shattering of bones and bones from inside and I heard the same sound as once , as before . I looked around , and looked around . My hand was in front of me , and my eyes were wide . I looked at the same person I had met , and I looked at them . I turned back to him and looked at him .   `` I ... I-I do n't understand . I have n't spoken in centuries . Have you ever heard the person before ? How dare you do this ? ''   I shook my head . `` I ... I do n't think I can make you feel safe around me , I just want you to hear me . I 'm sorry . Please do n't be mad . ''   What I was saying was that I could n't . He looked up at me , and then at me .   `` It 's okay . '' He continued , 'I 've been so angry for so long . I kept his eyes shut . `` I could n't live forever , I wish I could . Please . Please . Please Please . Please . Please , please . Please . Please . Please ... HELP ME . Please . Please ... Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please , please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . I love you ... I love you .   `` Please ? Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please Help me . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please ... ''   I turned to his face . His eyes were white , and as he looked at me , he looked at me and smiled . It was beautiful .   What I did was what I wanted . What the hell was this . I was just curious why I would n't have let him go . Why I would not let him harm me ? Why I would have to live forever and when I finally gave the whole world to him , what I had done was to protect him . Why did I need to tell him so badly ? Why did he want to know ?   `` Help me , '' he told me . But why I would n't let him go ?   `` Please . Please . Please . Stop . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . PLEASE . PLEASE . Please , PLEASE . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please .
They 're looking at me . She 's crying . She 's crying . She sobbing . I 'm telling them something you 'd like . I do n't know what to say , okay ?   The doctors are saying I can feel it . They 're looking at me . They 're holding me , and I ca n't . I can feel it all . I ca n't feel it . I ca n't feel it anymore . Where are we going ? I do n't think we can be together . It 's all going to happen . I ca n't feel it anymore . Maybe there 's another , maybe , just an understanding of me , from the beginning . I 'm the only being in this room who 's crying . I ca n't hear it anymore . He 's crying . I ca n't feel it . I do n't know what to do . No , I ca n't . I ca n't feel it anymore . I ca n't feel it anymore . I ca n't feel it anymore . I ca n't feel it anymore . I ca n't feel it anymore . All you feel is the pain where I 'm .
The man walked into the room , leaning back against his throne , his face was dark and empty .   He was sitting in a room that had n't been since his last moments of relaxation and anxiety . He was standing there , legs crossed in the wind , his body frozen in place .   `` Are you here again ? '' he asked .   `` I 'm here , right ? ''   The man 's voice was the same tone , not the man 's commanding voice . The man was not quite right . He was not exactly right - he had been just a man . But when he was staring at the room , the man 's face was so dark and lifeless . The man sat right in front of him , eyes hollow , like a knife , like its sharp surface , reflecting the stars above .   `` Hi , I got this letter . I 'll get you a treat ! I 'm gon na bring you some , alright ? ''   `` Okay , I want to get this letter , right ? ''   `` Good . ''   `` You okay ? ''   `` What do you mean ? I 'll carry it here ! ''   `` Do n't be too bad , I 'm too good in my own way , right ? ''   `` I 'm afraid , okay . ''   He went back to his throne , looking outside through the window . He noticed the stars above .   `` I 'm here now , okay ? What 's going on ? Can you please ? I do n't need to know . ''   He ran off , leaving the room to meet the man 's eyes . The man gave his smile and grabbed his head . He grabbed his arm and pulled his head off its head .   The man was standing there and looked at the sky . It was at the end of the story .
*Why not ? *   *My mother warned me not to go back to this life . And how can I go back home and get some groceries ? * I said as I lifted the keys in my pocket .  *Is it it so bad you will know what it is ? * I asked , shaking the fear that threatened to overwhelm me .   *Not yet , everyone has gone back to it . The first thing they notice is their skin . They 're not , and they 're not . So they 're not . * I started running , just running and running .   *I 'm not going to die . *   *I 'm not going to die . * I thought . *Please do n't . I will do it again . *   *I 'll do it again . * I said , sliding the keys into my pocket . * I should n't live , and I *m going to die . *   *I 'll do it again . * I said . *Is n't that what it means ? *   I shook my head . *They 're not supposed to be dead . *   *Why would I be scared to die ? * And then I heard something , and then I saw it . *Why not ?

I had never known what had happened , nor was it just another matter of time before . So far my heart could not control it , but from what the world had done , that was the beginning of my birth .   I had been born in my parent 's room , a longingly silent father , and this one I had never met . By this point , I had fallen out of bed , broken bones , broken bones and broken bones . My body , that was what drew me from the darkness that surrounded me , was not far away , but in the midst of my life . In my mind , I had been caught in a dark , dark prison , a room that seemed to be where I could begin . I could not only imagine the pain , just the pain , but of the pain and the pain , of the pain , of the sorrow to the suffering that could be the rest of the universe .   I decided to go to the park , so I walked , I walked through the park , did not know how to do it . The smell of the birds would be as close to me , and the smell of the birds would feel the way it was , and what they call a `` The Great '' . I wondered how different it was , why it felt like it was the end of my life . I saw a butterfly , floating in my hand , floating in the air , floating just like the night before , this time , he was almost dead .   At this point , I began to scream in pain . I felt warmth over me : my blood , all that was left of my body was a small , small puddle of blood , where it had never been , and how many times had passed from this horrific world has passed , but I had never seen a butterfly before .   I would never hear one of these words . I would never let go . I would never let go . I would never let go . I would never let go . In this moment , I would never know . For three months , I stood against the darkness , I would never be there again .   I would never be there again , for it was not my imagination that told me . Where did I go ? All I wanted was to be there , and be there , and live . And here I am , alone , in the darkness .   The sun shone through the thick fog , the lights had only begun to light . I felt my heart beating again , as if the ringing had stopped . But as I rose , the light became blinding .   The curtain slowly faded into grey , and was replaced with silence .
`` Just give me the strength ''   Jedi Master Yoda stared in the eyes of his lightsaber and stared at the Jedi . He had not seen a Sith being so angry about these actions .   The Jedi , a young Jedi Master , had raised his head . The force , against the Force , had killed his first Jedi Jedi .   He had not wanted to believe in Master Yoda . Just one sentence , with a hasty roll of his sword . He was a Sith Master , the Force .   As the Order Master Yoda stood there , his emotions started to form in a large smile . With a sigh he asked , `` What are you doing here ? ''   Noda chuckled . It was the Force .   That night the Sith Master Yoda , his master , had taken off his head by his own hands .   Anakin , his body in the dirt , was standing at attention .   * '' Is this ... Is it a Jedi who 's killed his soul ? Is this a Jedi ? Are you insane ? You are n't sure I can sense the Force Awakens ? ``*   Master Yoda shrugged . The Jedi had destroyed their previous Sith .   `` No , the Force is ... ''   `` The Force is dead . ''   `` No , it is a Sith being . ''   Obi Yoda , his weapon in the dirt , could not let him see what he was doing . His lightsaber was broken and burnt , the black steel blade falling to the ground .   Sith Master Yoda looked at the ground with tears in his eyes . He thought about the Jedi .   * '' The Force is alive , the Force is alive . Anakin has taken over and killed his master . `` *   Obi Yoda shook a hand . Before the Jedi could reply he held the lightsaber up . He wanted to laugh . His anger was too much .   The Sith Master Yoda shook his head .   The Force , confused , stared at him with a tear in his eye .   * '' Did you know that the force is dead ? `` *   He looked at the Jedi and said , `` The Force is dead . ''   Darth Yoda nodded . Just then , `` That was not an easy question , dear . ''   A dark Jedi walked away slowly , his lightsaber still in his hands . He looked around at the Jedi .   `` Maybe not , friend , '' lightsaber said .   He looked at the trooper again .   `` I have been trying to kill Darth Yoda for another long time , '' Jedi Yoda said .   Obi Yoda nodded .   * '' No , I do not . `` *   * '' I do not want to be selfish anymore , I want to lose . `` *   There was a pause . The Jedi stood still .   -- -    **A Sith has fallen out of control . **
`` Hello Mr. Rogers , I took it as well as a request and it was me . I did not need your permission to receive a assignment. `` , he said with a sly smile , closing his laptop and crossing his arms for a moment , before continuing .  `` I will receive any information I have to offer to you in the mail. `` , he replied as he always did .  `` Do you understand why we have this invitation , sir ? '' He asked , a little impatient .   `` Sir , I am your supervisor . You were receiving a task that you can not even request. `` , he began .   `` I do . Just . Thank you for the opportunity. `` , he said with a smile .   `` The email is made in my email , sir , '' he replied , pulling out a photo of his wife .   `` Thank you , '' he repeated , putting the photo back on the floor .   `` Good man , '' said a couple of people , and we both sat back down on our bed .   I kept going , and finally took a deep breath . Before I could open my laptop , I stood up and closed the laptop . I started typing furiously . I opened and another email came out of my inbox ...   I was out out of thin air . I opened the email and found the envelope . It was printed , and a small black envelope was printed in various forms .   I quickly selected the envelope , and opened it .   The mail was a letter . I felt good to read it . I opened it like I had just read it , and saw the name . I opened it and it was addressed by a tall man .  `` Welcome back , '' he said .   `` Name ? This is the envelope . Do any of your things ? `` , he said in a voice that I do not understand .   `` Thank you , '' he said , opening the envelope again .   `` Thank you. `` , I said , shaking with fear .   I was on my way back to my room , and waited for the one thing I would like to say .   I looked behind me . The man was holding the envelope in my hand .   `` What is the problem with your contract ? '' I asked .   `` I am your supervisor . '' He said , taking out a envelope of mine .   `` I read this thing. `` , he said , putting the envelope back on the floor .   I turned away , and walked over to the man . He was smiling back at me .   I took the envelope out of my hand and opened it . Inside was a large red envelope sitting next to the post apocalyptic building . It was a new envelope , just a small piece of paper . The small black envelope slowly opened .   `` Thanks . ''  
That 's how I started . My family was a family member . Even with a kid like me , a kid like me , got married and a granddad did n't make a great deal with all the world . There were plenty of people out there , but I was n't sure .   Being the one who hated my parents from the start . A father who was dead , an alcoholic and the one who had always been a kind of man . He was the first to hear from others like me . And it was n't the time to tell their parents anything , so I tried to remember his name .   `` Hi , Mr . Hitler . '' I said to myself .   And you see , I was n't a fan of the guy who had just left me for .   `` You know , there are a few rules ; that 's some kind of misunderstanding . You have to remember the rules , though , there 's a book you can read and everything is like 'What you 're saying . ' ' Do you remember them ? ' ' Do you remember them ? ' They were right , and that 's how a book they 'd read .   So you just think that the rules were done , Mr. Hitler ? I mean , I 'd have to answer . I had my suspicions to get my first witness , and that one thing was to tell my parents that there was no way I could do it . Oh , well , I went and went .   And you hear me ? I saw you . And there I was , with those big , white gates like this and the gates like 'The One ' .   I was told by a kid who died , and that they were n't real . He told me he was my dad . I heard his voice , and he did n't know me . But I really did .   He told me if I heard my name , then when I heard my answer , he told me . I mean that one thing because the other thing , is that even if I said it , what I said was 'the One ' ? ' And that said , `` That 's why I chose to destroy all of your countries for so long and so now that I 'm really the one that tells you to do it . To make America worse . To make America worse . With your country . To make the world worse . To get rid of everything . To make America worse . I 'm too sure that that there 's no life left to protect .   And you 're a Christian who did n't . I just had to listen to the rules .   But that did n't help me feel the same . I did n't want to be at peace with the world .   And I wanted to be here . I wanted to make America better . I wanted to get rid of everything that I said that my country was n't evil . I wanted to go out with the world I had to say , but there was no way I could do it . I wanted to live with all my people , to take away the world I had in my life . I wanted to be the savior of all of the world , to be the savior of all their worlds . To make America better , to make America better , to make America better , to keep the world worse .   So I just wanted to see the world better . That 's why I hated my entire life .
I 'd barely taken notice of myself before lunch . I 'm a little scared because my parents are dead , and for some reason , I do n't really really care . My father always kept saying hi to me and then said hi . No one knows how much you actually see them , just let me know what is wrong with their lives .   I 'd made sure they were n't in my way now . They were really good at it , just as it is the way they would be . They would be happy . They did . And then they would be happy if I were a kid .   I remember my mom yelling . `` What did you say ? ''   `` I did n't know . ''   `` I did . '' I did n't even care . I do n't care what they used to be . It 's all really important .   I remember my mom saying it . It was n't really important , but I know it was important . I did n't care . I just ca n't understand why she said hello . It 's like she said hi to me . I do n't care why .   I went back to my mother . It was n't nice , so the way she said hello was so funny !   My father finally called me down because he was there , but I stopped when he started talking . I felt stupid . I had n't done that to him yet . I did n't care . I did n't care . I did n't care .   I just needed to go home . I was in my room in the hospital . I told my mom , how much you could see me if it were n't real . She was there . Daddy had a strange look on his face . He was just as confused as I was when he started talking to me . I walked over to the table where my mother is staring at me , but instead of looking at my father , he said nothing .   I did n't hear him talking . I did n't care . I did n't care . I did n't care . I left this room .   I was n't alone .   I did n't care . It 's not in the hospital .   I looked at my sister . I did n't even care . I did n't care .   I did n't care . I do n't care .   I did n't care . I did n't care . I did n't care . I did n't care . I cared . I did n't care . I did n't care . I did n't care . I never care about my mother anymore .   I was n't alone .

`` Hello , Kanye ? '' Kanye asked , taking off his hat and lighting it up .   `` Yes , I already know you 're an ass . '' Kanye replied , putting his hand around his hips and handing him a list of names .   `` This is Kanye , '' Kanye said , as he pressed the button on his phone . Kanye waited for him to die , before speaking again .   `` Tell me how ? '' Kanye asked , though he was in awe .   Kanye looked up , knowing if he could make it out of his lips . Kanye put his hand on his stomach and gave him the name he wanted to tell him .   `` Kanye , I still feel about you . '' Kanye said , and took off his sunglasses . Kanye stood up and looked around while running his hand through his hair . `` I 'm Kanye . '' Kanye explained , and picked up his shoes , before noticing the logo of Kanye speaking again , `` I do n't know what you 're doing here , Kanye . '' He started walking away .   Kanye leaned in to him and made his way back into stage . `` If you 're not working on the presidency , then you have to give up . '' Kanye said , nodding , `` I ca n't help but pick a few things up . The whole team looks really good at some of us . I 'm getting it , '' Kanye said , and kept running his hands through his hair .   Kanye looked around , but he still had an idea that he was in the business of getting away . `` I 'm sorry , Kanye , you 're right . I do n't want to have it here in your entire life . I wanted to be president if you ca n't . I want to be president . '' Kanye started walking away from stage , at least he could have gotten away in the next few seconds .   Kanye took off his sunglasses , and his suit swelled with the heat of the sun , `` Go ahead and I 'm going to leave North alone and the country will never seem to go to hell . '' Kanye did not waste a moment to walk away .   Kanye walked away , and saw that Nick was smiling .
The man , young as all animals , was walking walking to school and leaving the school yard . It had been a decade since he had looked back at the watch , and there was a large cloud in the area . It was more of an hour until the boy had a look of anger on his face .   He had n't been able to talk , and he was n't quite sure whether or not the night had gone dark just after he had been given the appearance of something that might be a normal , slightly different skin , but it would n't seem to change . It was something he had never seen before , or could n't believe , just a small white sign that read : ** '' Here you go , boy . '' **   The man looked around the room . Everything was dark , and there was nothing but darkness . Except for the shadows of the room . And , not the man , but the trees of the room . Nothingness in it . He stretched a hand dismissively , and watched as everything changed .   * '' Here you go , boy . '' *
As many of the time , I do n't know the right kind of ways for me to go . I just did n't really have the power for the most part . I just got a couple hours ago and eventually I would finally have to go and die of exhaustion . I 'd continue on my own , the best path that the universe could manage before I could have let up a little .   For example , the goal was to travel in a land where a single , very large , and very similar towns could be found and then go back to the small villages . On the outside of the town , there are two major cities : One is a woman , and some type of person is also an overweight man , if not from the far south . On the outside , there is also in this town who can not be seen by her people to any extent .   The roads of the town seem to have been abandoned for several years . The towns around were mostly uninhabitable and other areas still seemed to have been evacuated in the first place . Some of them had not been taken from people or harmed , well , that was n't much longer .   There were four houses here , a few houses , a few houses . There were houses , small houses , some even a few houses . There were one houses that did n't belong in place , or on the outside , or at least around the town , or even the town that was left where the town was .   This town is of immense power . It could n't be used by anyone , but it sounded like they were somehow connected . In fact , as much as it had been hidden on the outside , there was a few houses that were n't there . I just made it to the village first ; some houses , and some kinds of people . You 're a monster of all shapes , and animals , and even one of them is a strange pattern , some trees that can even be seen , and some sort of person , and some people are different .   Do n't worry , there is no way the city at all . Those people seem to be moving at all with their own hands . What 's going on about ? It 's not to be too dangerous , it 's not to be hurt . I just want to make sure it goes to the town 's centre , and if there is still someone who decides where their next village is , they 'll be left alone .
`` ... and what about democracy ? ''   `` The war , the war and the war .   `` The wars , the war , the civil war .   `` The war , the war , the war ... ''   He looked across the room . `` They are so fragile ... ''   `` The empire , the war , the war ... ''   He drew a long sword . `` They fought in their defense , not fighting in their defense , nor fighting in their defense ... ''   `` No ... no ... they ... they were *they* , I saw them . ''   `` ... we were too weak , both ... 'the war ... ' they had our surrender . ''   `` No ... ''   `` *They* did n't attack . ''   `` Yes ... then ... and so ... and so ... ''   `` ... but ... ...

''   `` ... and ... ''   He paused , and looked back to the war .
“ Hush here , ” muttered Jason . “ We get a good look over the world . Your wife , my wife , and my wife , who will have lived in a trailer in a trailer without me but you can ’ t get away with all these people. ”   Jason ’ s frown softened . “ Well , I can , ” he continued , looking for the source of the newsfeed . “ I suppose this is what our marriage had like in the past year. ”   Jason shook his head . “ My wife , she lost the most part. ”   “ And it isn ’ t yours ? ” He leaned in close with his head tilted in his right . “ Our son , Dr. Brown , my wife and children , still hasn ’ t aged . I ’ m a son of the world and it ’ s something here. ” Jason gave the rest of the article , making sure he ’ d been left on Earth .   Jason looked out at the small blue sky , a vast expanse of space . He was surrounded by a myriad of stars . The stars lit up behind those stars , and the light from the sun seeped through those stars . And Jason thought about his wife , and the entire world . What he ’ d done to her was to make sure he loved her .   “ I will see you soon , ” Jason ’ s voice boomed over the horizon , and Jason glanced at the horizon . Jason chuckled at the idea of the planet ’ s origin .   “ I 'm going to tell you , ” he said gruffly . “ What will this happen to you , now ? ”   “ Nothing ! ” Jason shook his head . “ I will see you soon , ” he looked up at the sky . “ I will see you soon , your children will be back , but you will soon be gone . And trust me , ” he said , almost completely unaware of the fact that the story was going to end .   Jason looked out again at the sky . “ My baby . I ’ ll see you soon . And we will see you soon , '' he said , slowly taking a position on the bed . “ And you will see me soon. ”   *****   As Jason sat with his wife playing with the sun , Jason looked down at the sky . He saw a little light from his face . A ball in the sky , facing the heavens .  
`` So here we are , the man I put down , '' said a figure .   `` You have an interview , '' I replied , `` we have a meeting in the morning. ``   Death 's eyes narrowed and he smiled . `` You would n't say that . ''   `` What do you mean ? Is this you 're talking about yourself ? '' I asked .   `` There 's a problem . I come to collect you . '' He began to blink . A flash of silver in his eye snapped back and revealed himself in front of me .   `` Hello ? '' I stammered .   `` I will come , '' he said , `` when I ask you what you want . ''   `` So is that what I have to offer ? '' I asked , `` I have five options . ''   `` Now , '' Death replied , his tone as black as coal . `` If you are going to have to say that you are actually going to die from cancer , at least with your remaining form . ''   `` Thank you , '' I said , `` but you must choose the first . ''   `` I 'm glad of you . I have a choice for you to offer to me , and your gift is here for the first time in your life . ''   `` Why not ? ''   `` The first time you take my form , I will offer you two options to give you one choice . ''   `` And I shall offer you six options in the evening . ''   `` But I must choose one choice to give you two choice . '' I continued , my tone sounding nervous .   `` Right . '' He said with a knowing look on his face . `` Let me just give you ten options , and I will find out if you can take me one option . ''   I was confused . Death sighed heavily . `` So can you choose one option for me ? ''   I asked the question . This was an interesting answer . Death could only choose one option to take to choose one side of the world to give me three options . I did n't need another option .   `` Will I choose ? '' I questioned .   `` Do n't choose three options . What will I choose ? '' He laughed again . `` Would you wish to choose one option ? ''   I asked the question again . `` Alright . I go back to the beginning . ''   He handed me a list of options . I picked them up and examined the number of options . `` Now you will leave , and I will provide you one options for you . ''   I left the room . I had to choose one option , but I was already a coward . I looked inside , but there was a hint of doubt in the head of Death . I thought back to the moment I realized I had a choice .   `` Do n't choose one option , '' I argued , `` if you choose one option , maybe you will . ''   Death turned towards me , `` Will I choose the one option ? ''   `` Will I choose the other option is ? I will choose one option to give you three options . ''
`` The news has said something is wrong , so I live comfortably on a farm in California and I have to walk around to find myself here . ''   `` Not really . ''   `` Did you see that ? ''   `` The news ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` People actually say something . They say something . ''   `` Apparently , it does n't mean something is wrong for you . ''   `` But you look ... like ... a huge animal ? ''   `` But you are telling me everything is wrong . I 'm not telling people you are getting a little concerned . Oh , you 're telling me everything is wrong . I do n't know why . No , it 's just not wrong . ''   `` I ... What ? ''   `` Well ... the news is n't helping . ''   `` Why not ? ''   `` Because you already know what it means . ''   `` Oh , I feel . Tell me what it means . ''   -- -   `` But ... that 's it . I do n't know why . ''   `` And ? ''   `` *No , I can smell it . And that 's it . * ''   `` And if you 're wondering why I 'm here , what 's wrong with this ? ''   `` I 'm just telling people I 'm here . * ''   `` Do you know why ? ''   `` Yes . If I do n't tell people I 'm going to be here before I die . ''   `` It 's not necessary . ''   `` Do n't worry . I 'm just saying something . ''   -- -   `` So ... what do you think I 'm doing ? ''   `` I think I 'm going to have the time to figure out what to do . I 'll start the day you are going to die . ''   `` ... Well ? ''   `` I do n't know . I want to kill you . You feel all better . ''   `` Well , not really . ''   `` I 'm going to go to the hospital . ''   `` I still do n't know what to do , my doctor . ''   `` I know because people probably know I 'm giving you something else so that I 'll be asking you to take the same amount as me . ''   `` I 'm the one who 's lying . And I 'm a doctor who 's the one who 's not talking about the cancer . ''   `` I think I could know you ... you 're going to die . ''   `` You do n't want to die , but I 'm sorry for failing . And I know you 're not going to die since you were born . ''   `` So I guess I 'm saying something else ? ''   `` I mean , I mean , I do n't know who I am . I am writing people I love most . But I know nothing about dying because people love me , every day . I know everything about you . I 'm just saying something else I love most . I know you 're going to die soon . So you are going to die and I 'm going to die from it . ''   `` You 're going to die right then . Why do you want to die ? ''   `` Because I 'm trying to ask people . ''   `` Because I know . I do n't want to die . If the truth was wrong , I would never be the one who died . ''   -- -   `` Maybe I might have died sooner . ''   `` But ... ? ''   `` I 'm taking the same amount of time with this . ''   `` At least I 'm just saying there 's one thing I do n't want to die . ''   `` So why do you need the option ? When I 'm dying , there 's a great sadness I did n't want to die , ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I 'm a man of old . And I know . ''   `` And what will happen next ? ''   `` If you kill me , I 've gotten the point of
`` Listen to me , I 'm going to need you . ''   The old man grabbed his scythe and shot it into the trash . `` When the story ends . ''   `` I 'm going to need you , I mean , I know it 's because I have no idea who it is . You know , it 's a real story , but it 's not . ''   Behind him the old man tried to catch his breath and he let his eyes drift over to what was being whispered . He made a quick motion , then passed it over .   `` Well , I 'm gon na need you to help . ''   The old man started walking away .   `` Then , please , stop me from talking to my brother . ''   `` So , what are you doing ? ''   `` I know , because I have no idea who it is . ''   `` I do n't know . I need you to understand what the story does . ''   `` I know . ''   `` You are going to go on this story then , and I will you please stop me . ''   As he walked away the old man stood up and shuffled to the door . `` I can do nothing for that . ''   A quick peek around the corner . No one stirred . Just the old man peered through the door . It was an empty house and was littered with people standing in front of it . They all looked at it .   The old man waited as he looked at the old man . Then he took a deep breath .   `` It 's on your finger . ''   A single bullet hung from he 'd just opened up .   `` I 'm going to need you to tell me that my brother has died . ''   The old man chuckled as he pulled out his scythe and took a deep breath . `` I need you to help me . ''   The old man stood still and walked away .
`` How long have you been here ? '' I asked myself as I gazed down at my birthmark .   `` Six hours ? '' He asked as I gazed at the birthmark on his wall .   `` Six days ? '' I asked him .   `` Six hours . '' He replied . I sat on the beach watching the waters sink into the water .   `` Six days ? That 's six months . '' I said . `` Six weeks ? ''   `` Five days , '' he replied . `` Eight days ! ''   `` Six days ! It 's six days ! It 's seven months ! And you 're fucking here ! ''   `` Eight days , '' I said .   `` Six days , '' he said .   `` Six days ! '' I said .   `` Six days ! '' He announced .   I walked over to my family 's counter . They had put a mug of coffee on the counter , and I could n't help but smile . They did n't seem to turn off the water . I checked my birthmark , and my second birthmark was a red dot . It was not a purple eagle .   `` Eleven days ! I 've been here ! '' I shouted .   `` It 's not your birthday , '' he said .   `` What the fuck ? '' I stammered .   The water was rolling . It stung worse than any other day , and I could n't help it . Nothing happened .   The water was getting darker . I looked down at my birthmark , and said , `` Six days ! ''   I could n't help it . I looked down at my birthmark . The egg was gone , and the floor was slowly falling over . Everything was gone .   I walked over to inspect it , and saw it was a scaly , dark pink . `` Six days ! '' I yelled .   The room was white . There was a small hole in the center of the hole . The hole just looked like someone had left it on . The door opened and something in the middle of the hole seemed to touch the hole .   `` I 'm sorry . '' I said . I ran through the hole , but the hole did n't seem to grow . There was no way inside . The hole was gone . That was too far , but it was more covered . The hole opened up . `` Six days ! ''   I sat there , still in shock , `` Six days ! '' I asked with a chuckle .   The hole felt good . I looked at it , and could n't help but laugh . The hole started to be there , but the hole opened up to reveal a small diamond . It was a metal ring , hidden under the ring . It was a small brass ring , with a small round and small button on it . There were lots of buttons at it , but it was probably attached to it . It was a tiny , shiny ball . There was a small rectangle that was attached to it .   The diamond started to grow and grow until it reached the bottom to meet it . I felt like it was going to explode , but the cave was gone .   I looked away . My skin was white , and I did n't want to scream . I did n't want to scream . I wanted to scream . I wanted to scream . I wanted to scream ! I wanted to move . I wanted to do this . I wanted to scream again . I wanted to scream , but I could n't . I could n't . I looked back at my birthmark . The blackened ring , and gave it a start .
There was an odd amount of awkwardness that I left from my roommate on our fourth birthday . Something very odd was happening . I had to talk to him if I ’ d known him when he was out of the closet , and I thought I knew what it was , yet all the time . I was so happy that I knew what it was wrong .   I ’ d been spending a lot of time alone , of course . I ’ d watched him die for the rest of his life and he was not afraid of me . If he wasn ’ t ready to let me sleep , I ’ d give him a nod on the head . I would go away and see how big he was and not , I would do some good to himself . But we still hadn ’ t left the house , and when he came here he was dead .   It was at this point that I was happy . And he was alive without going back to his house . I moved , and I eventually found myself in the dark .   We pulled out the lamp and found that it was dark in fact . It was lit by green flame . I would burn soon enough and that I would give him food . The bulb on the ceiling had a glowing glow forming on its own screen , which he left me . So it stopped .   “ What time ? ” I asked , a weird feeling that I was having having some existential crisis .   “ Oh , I ’ m gon na take it . I ’ m going to have to kill it. ”   “ Fine , then. ” He grabbed a small book from his drawer .   “ What ? ” I asked .   “ I ’ ll kill it. ” He shook his head .   Suddenly , it suddenly hit me , knocking at my door with a thud . I didn ’ t hear it .   After a few minutes , the light began to dim and it became black .   “ What is it ? ” I asked , wondering . Who was this person ? I stood up and touched it . It started to glow , but I knew I ’ d already been standing before . He opened the book and revealed a dark monster , a tall , reptilian being .   “ Hello ? ” I asked , walking through the forest .   “ What ’ s up ? ” I asked .   “ My roommate , are you okay ? ” said the Monster .   “ That ’ s it. ” He said .   This time , I was confused .   “ What do you mean , ” I replied , walking towards the closet .   “ All right . And what 's up ? ”   “ Nothing a little weird . No , I just don ’ t know what it is. ”   “ Is that what ? ” I asked .   “ I know , look , it ’ s… it ’ s just… it ’ s just ... I should make it. ”   “ I can make it ’ s *your* apartment. ”   “ Like , just get in the truck . What ’ s up ? ”   “ I can build it . I can build it . I can help. ”   “ But… it ’ s not *my* apartment. ”   “ What happened ? ” I asked .   “ It ’ s just… I ’ m not having any real talk. ”   “ I do n't know , why ’ d I come to my apartment ? ”   “ I ’ d be in the truck . I can make it better . But… it hurt , but I need to help. ” The monster had taken my face from the wall and I saw that I was in the bedroom .   “ So , ” I said , trying to make sense of what was just on the wall at once .   “ You know , I did . Not just anything , but something I can help you. ”   “ I can make it better I ’ m going to see it. ”   “ Maybe I can help you . You can . You can . You can. ”   “ It ’ s not .
`` Fuck , fuck ... '' I thought .   I had just run a couple paces around the office - the one with a couple of kids , all in the same room . They were too scared to escape , and they screamed - they had to be in a hospital .   `` Stop ... '' the old man said , his voice a mix of anger and anger , and I was forced to look at him . He was on the verge of tears . He looked at me , his jaw wide open .   `` Stop ... ''   I felt like I was in bad shape . The kid 's face was dark . He had an accent that made me feel different , and his eyes were green with dread , and he was almost certain he was being with someone else .   `` Stop ... '' he whispered .   `` Stop ... '' I stopped . Everything hurt . He looked up to me , and looked at me .   `` I 'm sorry ... '' he said . `` I knew you were here . ''   I left , away , and turned to see him . He was looking at me , and he was the oldest of people who seemed to have been with me for months . I was n't sure if he was sad that way , and I knew I could n't .   `` You do n't understand , '' he said , staring back into me . `` You 're right , they 've got your own kid . ''   I looked over and saw her right there . My hand came up and I looked behind me . I ran back my head .   `` I 'm not seeing you again . I am not seeing you , '' I said , before continuing , `` I 'm sorry . I just came here yesterday , now and I 'm still here , and I 'm still here . ''   An old man , staring straight at me . He looked at me again , and I looked away .   `` I did n't know you were here ... , '' he said , and he looked at me . I looked back in the mirror , at him . `` You do n't understand , man . It 's a weird-looking spot . You 're right here , and I 'm sorry . I have n't seen you in years . I know I 'm wrong , but I do n't know you and you just do n't understand . You were n't supposed to do anything , just go for a walk . I heard you say a lot of things , and you do n't understand . I just want to do something ... '' He had said , and I sat down while my friend tried to look me over in the eye , and my fingers were still numb .   `` I 'm afraid you 're here , '' I said , pulling away the mirror . I was n't going to get to this . I thought the old man was in his seat . `` It 's probably sad that you are here . ''   I nodded , and he looked away from me . I had just been walking for so long now . I had been walking towards them for so long now . The old man started to try to talk , but I did n't care about him .   `` What is it like ? '' I asked , and it was cold . `` I 'm afraid you 're here , and here ... Do n't tell me how long it 's about you . ''   I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply and a little . Soon , someone , who seemed to be asking me about the doctors , came back again . They rushed in through the doors and stood on the verge of tears , but I could n't help myself . I reached for my hand , and my whole world was black .
It ’ s the end of a long journey .   But even if the last of us are afraid , we are afraid .   There is no other choice .   You made it , never again .   There is another chance .   There is also a choice .   There , just like a little one .   The end of a long journey .   We ’ re told that our journey may be forgotten .   We are told that it might be forgotten .   Death is forever forgotten .   The end of another tunnel .   Death is still forgotten .   He wears white , white , black , white , hooded .   “ Hey , hi , ” I whisper . I wish I could call him before he disappeared .
`` Ok , I 'm okay with you , '' the man said to me , `` I 'm alright with you . ''   I sat back down , listening to the voices . `` Wait , what ? '' He asked , `` Look , you 're crazy . We 're in the right place . There are some people here , and some people at the right time . It 's time for you to come back into the present . ''   He looked up at me and replied , `` Yes , I am , '' He said , `` You do n't ! I 'm not ready for this . ''   I looked at him and said , `` Alright , *this was supposed to be fun . I do n't want you to come back . * '' He said , '' Here 's what I 've done . And I 'm so happy to come back . But , I 'm not ready for this . `` *   My mind drifted to my brain , and I realized I was just ... not ready for this .   I sat back down by this , as the rest of the day passed . I was just ... ready .   The next day , I was walking past it all . I was being dragged around the room , a man with a scar on his neck , and a man with some more scar on his face .   `` Well , you 're not ready . ''   With that , I kept walking . I was left alone for the first time - though I was n't ready for it . All that was left of me was a couple of hours away .   `` So , *the* time machine was supposed to be in the past , '' I asked , `` but I was still holding onto it ... you know where ? ''   Finally an unfamiliar man with a scar was walking past me .   `` Oh , hey , '' he said , `` I 'm ... '' He stared at me expectantly .   `` Sorry , '' I said , `` but ... you know how big it is ? ''   He jumped out of his chair , and smiled , `` Yeah , I get it . Maybe you 're wondering where it is . You know I can help you , at some point I like you . ''   I was interrupted by the man 's remark caused by the gunshot and the man 's arm was bleeding .   `` *So , *what did you do ? '' I asked , dropping my scar on my head . I gave him a thumbs up , then left .
I stare in disbelief , but slowly nod my head .   `` Well , what are we supposed to do about it ? '' I ask , and then I know it . My mind quickly starts racing . I know what everyone is talking about .   `` We do n't plan to get a little bit angry , '' I call out , gesturing towards the camera . `` Now , we can work here , and we could get in a few hours . That 's it , right ? ''   The drone starts to hum . The drone starts to hum . I immediately raise my hand and the drone stops running . I turn my head to look up .   There 's nothing there . The drone starts humming again . I just make this one go . I try to ignore it and start walking towards the drone .   `` That 's a dumbass , '' I say , looking at the drone .   `` Do n't play video games on games , '' I say , looking at the drone . It 's playing and I look at the drone and the drone starts to hum .   A female drone begins humming again . I slowly head to my left to see the drone and the drone starts to hum again .   Then , a female drone starts to hum again .   `` Are you ready to play video games ? '' I stare at the drone .   The drone continues to hum again . `` You seem awfully stressed about politics , as well as the whole world is in danger . I 'm not looking for a more organized military installation . I 'm looking for any updates , '' she says calmly .   I 'm trying to get my head back to my right , but before I can finish , it pulls the drone to a stop . As the drone continues to hum again and again . In the distance , the drone stops humming . I look down to see the drone and the drone is humming . It 's spinning again .   `` That 's not what we just do . We 've been building that goal . '' The drone continues to hum again . `` I 'm not going back to the drone for the next time , '' I say eagerly .   `` This is not what we have , '' she says with a smile . `` We all wanted it . We wanted it . ''   `` You 're a smartass , '' I reply .
The first time I walked in , this universe was far too bad - to say I could tell they were starting to change much . I was a little bit shocked by the way I made it . But when I walked in , it became a tiny little bit too small .   He did n't even notice . I was an angry guy because of the bright flash of light , as much as I could muster . Even though he was still a teenager , I was n't sure what to say . We were having fun , with God and I had little time to learn to talk about the universe . We could n't be together .   It was as if I was n't a normal guy . Perhaps we were both gods . Maybe we should be together . But my curiosity overcame me . It came to a point when we could build some things . Not everything in those world , not everything we were as intelligent as we were .   We got to it together . We were playing with it . It was too bad , too . And we left . Even if it were n't made from a single dimension , I was n't going to lie . I was n't going to lie to everyone . I was going to be alone .   And I smiled to see him . Perhaps I should do something . It was *every* time ; and my ego was so great . And then I made a mistake .   As I got to the front of the universe , I realized I was n't a model . Maybe this was the *purpose* that I could n't share . Maybe it was ... Maybe *something* in this universe . I thought maybe maybe I should go over to the next planet . Well , since the Sun would start a new planet . I looked around and was almost feeling worried , and thinking , I was going to go over the next one .   Then I saw a small , nondescript thing in it 's place . It was n't large , but it looked like it was taking a seat next to it . What I saw was a tiny object . It 's *incredibly* small , with a tiny button on it 's side . It moved on its side , toward it , and it came closer to its side , and it came closer , and closer .   I smiled to see the object in it 's place . It was bigger , with smaller ... smaller ... smaller ... smaller ... smaller . It was wearing a suit ; it sat on its side and looked back , expecting to see me . When I came closer , it looked like it was holding something close to its ear . It was holding it down to its ear . The object reacted to it , and it simply began screaming .   I smiled and it started screaming . It opened its mouth to speak , words that only I could understand . *We* thought softly in silence , and then a voice .   `` Hey , I 've had a good day . ''   The voice was louder now than it had ever ever seen . It had a bigger voice , and it had a large and hairy frame . It had a small nose , and a large finger . It was small , like something to hide . I did n't know what to do . But I knew that it was bigger , bigger , smaller . I was smarter than anyone else . I would n't understand why it had n't moved on . It was different . It was bigger , and bigger , than anything else I had before . I would n't know what to do . It did n't understand . It looked like I had just figured it would look like I had forgotten it .   And I was n't so sure what it *was* .   `` I ca n't see something to do with it . I do n't know if I can see anything , but I know when I look at your hand , I will have forgotten it . I can see the glimmer of light on your hand . I will do everything . God will fix it . ''   As if in his head , it was over .   He made a noise and the light suddenly stopped , and I was almost blinded by it 's light .   I began to feel scared , but I did too .   `` What are you doing ? ''   And I was gone . My head was hurting . I said `` Nothing . ''
The soldiers stared at each other in disbelief as they loaded up their rifles . There was no way they had expected such a situation . This did n't last long .    It 's not like he showed up , or that he was n't expecting something . They had to move quickly in a few minutes , with enough force to get him anywhere .    Then he lifted his rifle up from the ceiling , aiming his rifle at him . He stopped , looking at the soldiers behind him , and then up at the soldiers .    They exchanged glances and continued on . They did n't even acknowledge the signal , and he had n't noticed . They had n't , and not really , so they were both staring at each other without hesitation .    `` What are your orders ? '' he asked .    The soldiers stared for a moment , then back at him , unsure what to expect . Before they could say anything , he raised his rifle again .    `` I ... .I *have* . ''    So they started about firing .    `` Why 'd you just shut it down ? You 're not doing this again ? '' he asked .    `` I 'm just doing this again . I hate this . And I hate this one . I hate this one . I hate this one . ''    They were n't getting angry at him , where they were .    `` Are you afraid ? And do you have anything to do ? ''    `` I 'm just asking this one . I just want to do this . I 'm just talking to him . Do n't want to , just tell him because he 's not okay . He 's probably just supposed to have a couple of orders . ''    He shot their both down , and it was immediately clear they were n't going to have one .    `` I ca n't do this anymore . Please . '' he told them , and they both stood up , and started moving towards each other .    In a panic , a man walked to the front of the soldier , and opened fire .     `` Do n't you dare come back . I do n't want to . I do n't want to . I ca n't . I 'm so sorry . I ca n't do this . I killed an entire village . I ca n't do this again . I do n't want to destroy them . ''    They waited for the same response . He watched as the entire platoon cheered .
`` But I wish for the future '' a booming voice resonated from above the house . A man in a white coat waved .   `` Well boy , I did n't want you to be disappointed . Your mom is a good mom , but I was n't doing the dishes . So why are you doing this ? ''   `` I wish for my future '' . `` You are having a lot of fun , but I 'll do that with it '' .   `` Of course , I have a secret being . You were gon na be a good mom , I 'm gon na have to get used to it . I wish for the future to *look* about the wishes . ''   `` Yeah dad , you know what 's wrong with you . ''   `` I 've changed you once in a while . You were like the future '' .   `` That 's the only point of being interested in being interested in the future ... '' .   `` Hey dad , I 'm going to be crazy '' .   `` I 'm pretty sure I was n't going to do a thing with you . ''   `` But you 're so much more interested in being me '' .   `` Let me get your new home '' .   `` Sure mom , but I 'll do it '' .   For a second he said `` You 're really so happy . ''   `` What really ? ''   `` Everyone wants happiness back later '' . He turned away from the closet and returned home to where he was standing .   Standing there in front of his Dad looked through the small window , and saw a white silhouette .   `` You 're really happy '' . He turned away from the window and opened the door . After a few seconds he looked up at the genie , then back at what he thought was a huge shadow , with a little blue mist . It seemed that the figure was covered in a robe . He flipped it around and took a small breath before letting out a small `` Hi '' as a tiny `` Hi '' .   `` Yeah , all right '' .   He looked around . He saw a child standing there a little man holding a baseball bat , and looking up at him . `` Hi '' .   `` So '' . He started laughing . `` Is this really an honor ? '' . The genies face popped up in a smile and a tiny smile crossed his arms . `` So you were a great mom '' .   `` Yes '' .   `` Hey I 'm sorry '' .   `` Well , tell the boy what we need to do '' . The man looked at him quizzically . `` I 'm really starting to worry about you '' . He was growing agitated and had been trying to decide whether or not he could go get his wish off of him . `` So '' .   `` Why ? It was n't until I realize that I 'm not really worried about your wishes ? What happens to the future ? '' .   `` Yes mom , I 'm not sure . If you did , then why will you help me ? '' .   `` Ok . I know that '' .   `` I think you should have done something to the future '' . He reached outside , grabbed him by the collar and shoved him angrily into the room .   `` Let 's go '' . The lamp clicked and a genie 's wrist was released .   `` Alright '' .
The devil stared right at me , surprised at my surprise . I looked around the room , my own faces were dead .   `` Well , I guess so , '' he spoke , `` you want to talk ? ''   He nodded , then a grin settled on his face .   `` I 'll be here here , '' I said . I said , looking around the room . Strangely enough , my own name was Michael .   As I shook my head , `` Heaven does n't exist . ''   `` Hell does n't exist yet , '' he said , `` but you are n't the one you prefer to believe . What in your name is everyone you have ever loved ? ''   `` Hell does n't exist anymore , '' I said , trying to hide my frustration . I stood up to leave . `` I would have liked to stop you from here . ''   Michael leaned over the armrest to catch my breath .   `` No , I know . Most people get to know someone who wants to know someone who wants to know who is . Just like I said , who wants to know someone who wants to know who is . ''   `` That is why you do n't know who you are or why you 're here , '' I said , `` but I did n't want to know what to do with you . Would you like to know anyone who knows who you are ? Or would you like to know someone who wants to know what your name means ? ''    Michael looked around the room , confused at my reaction . `` In some ways , you can only imagine why you 're here , '' he said , `` but you still know who you are . From what I was told , everybody is here . Your very own religion is in place not good enough to know people who would want to know who you are . ''   
The silence was deafening , nothing special than a single glance in the mirror , just a little more surreal than the one I had seen in my life .   The hair that once occupied my face was covered in a mess of scar tissue , from that moment in the mirror it finally gave way to a gurgling , guttural scream with a whisper .   I stared into the mirror , dumbfounded . It was n't going to die yet . I 'd been expecting it to be my first time . I 'd been expecting it . It did n't even show much of a warning .   I did n't make it halfway through my morning routine , but I was standing at the bathroom in a half-sipid manner , so I turned around .   I was speechless , I had been expecting it , and was immediately surprised by what looked like an actual face would stare back at me . What kind of guy was this man ?   He was gone .   I stood up , looking at his face ,   I did n't even see his face .   `` Yes , we 've been sitting down for about a while now , '' he said in a harsh whisper , sounding somewhat uninterested . He stood up even further , holding up his hand to me .   `` I know ... '' I trailed off .   Then he disappeared .   I stood and dropped my hand . I was right there .   `` Do n't worry , '' I said gently , as I walked into the bathroom .   What did it look like ?   I did n't care what it looked like . The fact that I was n't wearing blood and I was surprised only one thing was missing .   `` How ... are you ... ? ''   He disappeared completely .   A few seconds later a voice took my silence .   `` I 'm sorry , we had to go home and see you on your face , '' I said , trying to find my face .   `` I ... ''   He was gone . We both had gone home and we 'd been together for a few weeks , and now I was in the bathroom with the rest of our friends , the one remaining that had n't been there , and I am still , not sure where I went .   I took over , and went to the bathroom .   No ... but I was not really feeling very wrong at first .   It was then that I realized I 'd been taking my place .   The door was opened .   My eyes were closed , and I was seeing myself in the mirror , too . I glanced at my face , and realized my face .   Then it began to shrink slowly slowly .   It seemed like it was talking , a little too quickly , then just a tiny fraction of me . I looked at my hand , then at it , then at my own .   It said something like `` They 'll do it . ''   I stared at it , then at it .   The eyes where suddenly closed . I stood up , and touched it . It 's very beautiful .   I stared at it , now , and it 's face was still as if it were a human , but it seemed like it was talking to me , saying something like `` I ca n't understand what they say . ''   And it paused .   I did n't know what I looked like , and I waited .   It 's eyes were closed , and the moonlight shone from it 's face .
I stood there on a bench next to him , standing at a manila envelope , contemplating what a story may have been . I had bought it for the year before , but I was n't making it for him . I knew he would n't be able to let me go , so I thought that he was only about to make it for me .   I was too young to be on a Saturday of my own , so I quickly opened it , and slid onto the bench . I sat there for the first time , in a booth with a manila envelope wrapped in a bag . What was that ? They said I was having a bad day , so I said `` What do you want from me ? '' I knew he would have asked . `` I 'm just a kid ! ''   I thought about it for a minute . Nothing did stop me from seeing him , but I still do n't think he was aware of how , how or how . I was getting used to this manila envelope . There was something in between her fingers that could n't make me feel like that . I looked at the manila envelope . He was shaking . I read it . I read it . I did n't think he was reading it now , but I did n't think he would reactivated .   My heart rate increased as I saw his face , and I was already in shock . I felt a sudden surge of courage . He did n't move . I stood up and walked away , feeling like I was leaving the box for him . I would n't have thought it was coming , but I could n't get out of that place . I was n't being paid . I could n't get out of this manila envelope .   The manila envelope was lying on the bench next to me . He looked dead in the eyes . He was back . If I had to see . I could feel his lifeless body screaming at me , but I was still there , just in time .   `` How ? '' He said . I looked into his eyes and saw the face of his soul . He looked like I had a dream , so small that I could n't see him . His lifeless brain was dead on the ground , but I knew it would n't be . I was dead , but I could n't do anything , as I had wished .   He did n't move . I could n't move . I was n't breathing . I could n't think , and I could n't even see him . Every fiber of my being that I took was gone . I could n't think , but I could feel his eyes on the manila envelope .   I looked at him . I did n't understand why . I ran through the park towards him again , and found the envelope : 'I 'll do it ! ' . I walked over to him , and noticed my face .   `` Do you want something ? '' He asked . I knew I had to move . `` I 'm going to see you . '' I said . I just moved from my position , and when I felt him , I was dead .   `` Please do n't do that . I need to , '' he pleaded . I held him close . `` Please do that . Please do n't do that . Please do n't do that . ''   I saw him smiling . He was a beautiful child . I smiled at him and pulled him close .   I saw him moving in his arms , and found him looking down at me with sad eyes .   `` ... you do n't know . You do n't know what to do . ''   I looked at him , his eyes widened at the memory , and then he understood .   `` I do n't know . ''   I just stared at him . I knew he had to be a child , but he could n't be his wife . I could n't feel tears . I could n't help but think back to how he lived . I felt the tears coming down each corner of his face .   I was lost . I looked at him . I felt his hands start to move as I did in between .   I did n't move . I could n't move ... I could n't hear his words . I could n't move . I could n't . I could n't see a single emotion for what felt like hours .   I did n't see the manila envelope . I knew it was gone .   I was n't going to see her again , but I ... I wished .
It was a cold cold night , and it was cold outside .   With a deep sigh they took each other step outside the cockpit , holding onto their seats beside the rest of the ship , the first real oxygen , and the second real oxygen tank .    The engines hummed and the ship hummed as they pushed open the window .    A man stepped out of the cockpit and looked out the window . The sky above him felt like it was a dark brown , gray and black . They looked out at the stars , not so quickly . The sun was rising , but then it was just a dark blue .    The man moved to the cockpit and began his descent past the mountains . The ship was still , and the next step was the last one . The shuttle was n't as large as it would be .    The man moved towards the ships , who was now sitting in a small room with a few others on their seats .    The man moved , `` It 's in time , darling . ''    The man removed his helmet and looked up from the seat .    Tears streaming down the man 's face , the man could n't have been his father , his father .    The man stopped and walked over to the man .    The man closed his eyes , `` I 'm sorry , I was just a few years away . I 've just forgotten you . ''    The man nodded and went over to the controls , looking out the window . The man looked out it , the first real oxygen tank .    A man began to scream as it was built . A man was yelling , pointing at the man , `` You have to be late ! ''    The man backed away , `` No , not now . ''    The man stood up , he was crying , `` Do n't play with me , I do n't feel bad ! I 've been so damn scared ! ''    The man looked out his window and saw the man , the father .    The man went over , `` I love you . ''    The man looked down at the screen , `` I love you so much , and love you unconditionally . ''    The man looked out the window and saw only the man and one man , his father , the father , and the father and his father were friends , the man .    The man started to cry again , but the man was crying again .    The man looked back at the screens , `` It 's time ! '' 
I walked through the park , along the street , looking for another sign of a homeless man . He stood over me . He had been talking about some crazy old man , his voice muffled by his own voice . `` I 'm sorry , but ... I 'm sorry , but I do n't care . Please , let me rest . ''   He was talking about the one that had been on his part when I had the first guy . He had a blank beard . He had a white beard , a white beard and a white shirt . A black shirt . It was white , with the same color as I had used it for what he was saying .   `` What am I doing ? ''   `` Nothing else . No one else to see . I 'm just -- ''   `` No ! No one else to see me . Please . I ca n't make you another . I 'm sorry . You need to be so hard . You just do n't need to know . You want your pain to be painful . I want yours again . Please . No one else to think about . I want yours . ''   He was trying to sound too calm . `` Do you have any other options ? ''   `` No , nobody else . How about you ? ''   `` I 've been there for a long time . I 'm so sad , I just do n't know what to make me angry . I 've been there for years . That 's all I 've done . I have a terrible job . I am sorry . ''   I looked at him . He was crying , and he knew this . He knew this man had seen me before . He knew this man , and he knew this man . He knew this man , and I knew this man . His only option . I did n't even know . We were both sitting down next to each other and looking for another sign of a homeless man . There was no way he knew what other odds were , so I ran back to the bench . I was exhausted . His cries were almost sobs .   `` I am sorry ... I am sorry . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please .

`` I hope you do n't mind the trip to the desert . I 'm gon na get the new car on you first . ''   Dr. Blaine 's eyes went wide as he picked up the phone . `` There is a reason I ca n't take it anymore . Just a few more minutes . ''   Dr. Blaine pulled the phone away . `` That 's just a few minutes left . I 'll see you tomorrow . ''   Dr. Blaine glanced at the clock again . It was a 7am watch , so it was a good five minutes left before Dr. Blaine passed the number . `` This is a good time .

`` And it 's not your game ! '' I pointed to the sky . The sky that had been stretched across the universe had been illuminated by the lights . `` But this is the game . We need to fight the galactic champion . ''   They stood stunned , staring at the sky , blinking its eyes across their screens . `` I have an explanation . I am not the strongest , but I have come to understand , and I know that you want to defeat the galactic champion . ''   The skies behind him were a mixture of energy and energy and water . They still looked like they had a lot of ideas to suggest , and they looked at each other with anticipation .   `` And so , you must challenge a champion . ''   `` Perhaps they were a champion ? ''   `` Yes , I have . But , for starters , there are some sort of *things* , and there have *things* , and sometimes there are *things* , '' the heavens were giving in .   `` Who else ? ''   `` The champion , '' he said , holding up his hand . `` It appears all too well . Maybe some kind of *things* are going to have to be challenged , a chance at all . ''   A smile formed on his face , and a small smile spread across his face .   `` Oh , that 's not *that* the *things* . I 'm not going to win a tournament . I 'm going to win a tournament , you know . ''   `` Do n't do that . ''   `` Go and let me win . ''   `` You want to win my opponent , right ? ''   `` If he wants to win , I 'll win . ''   A pause flew across the sky , then an instant later , the sky turned white .   `` And what happens when he gets his stats ? ''   `` He gets *literally* a billion points in his head . ''   `` Oh , and that 's *me* , '' the ground erupted . `` That is just *me* . Maybe more more ? ''   `` Some of them just want to play . ''   A pause . After a few seconds , the skies turned white , and all that remained was a man sitting in the middle of a field . Below him was a glowing blue orb , a bright blue that covered it .   `` One more thing , '' the man said . `` The other one has decided that the champion has not yet learned , but he has already known him as the dominant leader , and has decided that he is being controlled by all other creatures . ''   A pause . `` After all , that was the way he planned . ''   If there was any other , the man would have noticed the aura of his planet , though they did n't want to . `` And then his opponent was completely aware of *me* . He had no idea . ''   `` But that does n't mean he has to choose , '' he said . `` He is the greatest or greatest , and he has done all this , but he could n't choose that . He also chose that . ''   `` And then his opponent is the best . ''   The clouds widened , and a few thunderous clouds filled the sky .   The sky grew darker .
( I never knew what to say if I knew in a moment . In fact , there 's only one thing I did n't see , I did n't think it was possible to be outside , not in a romantic way , and had a really nice conversation with my girlfriend . Also , let me start doing this for so long . )   I should have fallen asleep in this night . A loud thud , followed by a gentle thud , followed by a large thud . It was louder , and when I opened my eyes , a voice was in the kitchen , `` Oh wait ! Where are you ? Did you get in there for me ? '' I stood up , and ran my hand through his eyes . `` Who ? Who are you ? '' I stumbled into the kitchen and saw a large mirror , and I looked around . I was lying in a pool over the floor , surrounded by a puddle of blood and I could see a man in the living room . I sighed . I should have thought about how I was going down here . He probably even knew I was alive now , and it did n't matter . It did n't matter now . Being blind , I had to think about what he did to my girlfriend . If he took her in a bathroom , he stopped and looked around and seemed confused . `` What the heck happened ? '' I coughed again and closed my eyes .   `` I got in there for weeks ! Then what -- what the fuck was that ? ! '' He looked at me with wide eyes , and looked at me with fear .   `` I ... I died ... '' I spoke , `` And ... . what the fuck -- how is that ? ''   `` I killed you before you killed it -- and , as of late . '' He turned away . I could see the man in the living room , staring at me with anger . `` What the hell is wrong with you , you pathetic bastard ! ? ''   `` You were ... . dead . '' He was quiet . `` But do you know why ? ''   `` Yeah . You were dead you did n't . '' I turned and walked over to his head , and then I heard a small voice say .   We walked away , and suddenly I was in the living room .   `` Why is this happening again ? '' I asked , and put my hand on his head . `` You 've been alive for a few days now , and now for a few days , I will be dead . I will be dead . '' He grabbed my arm and took me by the shoulders , as if to call his name . I nodded .   `` I 're sorry , I ca n't let you know my name , so , I just ca n't ... . what happened ? '' He turned to me , and said :   `` I 'm sorry . ''

I had always spent a lot of time with them , looking for the best pet , the best dog I was . When I was seven , the best dog I 'd ever encountered . The best dog I 'd ever needed . And then it happened . It started out in my day , in my day , and then all my family went to sleep . And then I started to move , and when I was five , it happened . I always wondered why I kept counting , or how I was doing them all here , and for all I knew it would n't stop until they died . I lived longer than ever . I was the best dog I 'd ever had , and I had always been the best dog I 'd ever have . I tried to be strong , until all I had was a few small ones that I 'd ever wanted , to be the best dog I 'd ever had , and it all changed . Then I was all alone , and I was all alone .   We came here today , looking for another dog ; I found a small , leather bound book , all in the corner , that I had seen in years . I did n't know what it was , but it did n't take long . When I was fourteen , I pulled out a book , and it did n't make sense . Then I started opening it , and it happened again . It happened again , and again , but again , again , and again… and again . Then I took out a small , leather bound book , and began to make sure it was n't enough for me to be able to read . After a while , I tried to sleep , and then it happened again . Then , again , again ? When I woke up , I found a bag , and it was empty .   When I fell asleep , I was going home , and I wished I would see that day . I slept longer and longer than I had before , and then I came home . I woke up , and then , again , standing still .   But then , I woke up again . Now , I 'm alone , and I 've only been alone .
`` Oh god , '' I yawned .   He looked at me with his own eyes . `` Are you sure I 'm going to make you a naughty for Christmas , honey ? ''   I nodded . `` Then I got the gift , honey ? '' he asked me . I sighed .   `` I swear , '' I said . `` The Christmas is n't this good ... ''   He ran to the kitchen and grabbed me and slammed me down on the floor . `` Oh god , '' he said . `` I forgot it ! ''   `` How did you see anything in there ? ''   He did as he said , `` I 'm sorry how ... '' He pulled me up . `` I forgot it ! ''   `` I know , '' I said . `` I forgot it ! ''   He hugged me tighter . `` Yes , honey , '' he said . `` I forgot it ! ''   I grabbed my wrist . `` Now , '' I said .   `` But what the fuck was that ? '' He said .   I shook my head . `` No , dear , I 'm so sorry ... ''   The house was illuminated with shadows . The walls were covered in a tree . I could hear the soft beating of cars outside . I tried to grab my wrist but the lights were blocked by a dark red fire .   I tried to stop myself and pull through the floor . It felt fuzzy and warm against my skin . God , I was so sorry .   `` Oh God , '' he said .   I let go of him and pushed the rest of the way back to bed . He was gone . My wife was gone , except for the cold .   Where was I ? I did n't have to go back to bed . When I heard her voice , I was alone . I jumped up and took a step back .   `` Honey , can you hear me ? '' I said .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' She yelled . `` I 'm so sorry ! '' She shouted .   `` Oh god , '' I heard her shout . I looked up and saw the red flames . I looked back . It smelled like lavender .   `` How the fuck are you going on ? '' I heard her shout .   `` Oh God , I forgot it ! '' He told me .   He pulled me on and I jumped off the ground . `` Santa Claus ! '' he shouted .   `` My- '' He broke my trance . I stood up and walked out the door .   Nothing happened .   I walked to the kitchen .   `` Hey , '' I said . I smiled . I was surprised by the old man .   I looked at my wife , who was now gone . She had vanished .   I looked back at my husband .   `` How ... ? ''   `` I 'm so sorry . '' He laughed .   `` I know . '' I said , `` I know you 're a naughty son , but you 've been through life since Santa . You 've been through life for a while now . ''   He laughed . `` My friend- ''    I walked away .   He dropped me on the floor a few feet away .   I was in the kitchen , in the bathroom .   `` My ... . ''   He laughed . `` You were my wife- '' He burst out laughing .
`` What would you like to be there ? ''   `` No , what would you like to be there ? ''   `` I 'm sure it 's just a matter of time . So why would you like to find out who you were ? ''   `` It is n't *fun* . I 'm saying that you 're not real . I 'm going to be here every other day . ''   `` What ? ''   `` There 's no way a tattoo would happen here . I 'm going on live . ''   `` I 'm going to have you ... I 'm going to have you . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I hope you have some luck . ''   `` Now , you have me . How hard have we been together ? ''   `` You 're going to find it . ''   `` I guess I 'm going to be here now . ''   `` Have we been together for years ? You have a life . ''   `` Maybe you find it , though . ''   Just then , there was a knock on my door . The door was open now . All except for the door knob on floor .   `` You know what I 'm doing here , man . ''   `` Thanks , if I could just stay here . You 're going for a walk , man . ''   I turned around and saw something not right . The black on my arm was still black , and it looked like a human , holding it up to a small black . I looked down at it , and then at it .   `` Look , you 're a little confused . ''
“ Morning , ” I respond calmly .   “ Excuse me missus , but I ’ m not really sure what to do for you. ”   “ I haven ’ t just gotten here last night , ” he responds as he reaches for his phone .   “ Ugh ! I missus. ”   I stare at him . He hates this . As he turns on the computer , I notice the first text message .   “ Hey , I ’ m gon na ask what you ’ re looking for. ”   “ Uh , yeah , I don ’ t want to stay here. ”   “ Okay , okay . So you ’ re in the hospital right now . I guess I ’ m just doing my job. ”   “ There ’ s something else you can do , man ! ”   “ Wait , what ? What the hell ? No , it ’ s okay . Did you get here ? ”   “ Nah . Can ’ t do that now. ”   “ Sure. ”   I frown . I ’ ve been here for several years . I ’ ve been a long time .   “ Why ? You ’ re gon na need to give me a go . I know I need to find out what is happening . I ’ m just here to give you a go . I ’ ll run ! ”   “ Alright , OK , OK. I can ’ t do that and I ’ ll get my go . I ’ ll leave , and come home. ”   “ Ugh , I ’ ll just leave . You need to be home . Right now. ”   “ Wait , you are in the hospital. ”   “ Okay , okay . I ’ ll be home , and then we can give you the go . You ‘ re going to need to go . I ’ ll go. ”   We ’ re walking back to the car .   I ’ ve been waiting for months . I ’ ve been here for this moment . I hate this moment .    I got out of the car . I can ’ t stand it anymore . I had been here with him for years . Had he really hated me ? I would have never been here , and he was always here for me . If I hadn ’ t done anything bad , just let him pick it up and walk past me .   I need to get home . To go . To go . To . To . To . F . to . to .   I ’ m just doing my job .   I drive up the highway , and there ’ s a van . It ’ s been around two hundred meters since I lost myself in the field .   My name hangs across the street . I feel like I ’ ve lost everything . It has been an accident and I just lost my car . I should have known . But I know this .   I run past the police station and I take them out . It ’ s not like I had given it to him .   I run around the corner to see what I was looking for . I think I ’ ve lost everything .   I see the truck parked on the interstate . My car is empty .   I look at it . It ’ s empty .   “ Why didn ’ t you get here ? ” I say .   “ Because… I ’ m your mom. ”   I look at it . It ’ s empty .   They ’ re empty . There ’ s only a car .   “ Why did we get here ? ” I reply . “ Why did we get here ? ”   I ’ m not expecting them . They ’ ll never get here . I promise .   “ Why , why did we get here ? Why did we get here ? Why did we get here ? Why did we be here ? We had to let you go . To do something. ”   I know .   I stand there as if waiting for them to leave me to the car .   “ I ’ ll put you down . Forgive
The room has been filled with the sounds of a clock ticking down and down the hall . The last person in the room has been listening to the ringing of a clock .   `` Mommy , we 'll talk about it ; she 'll be there soon , '' I hear the phone ringing .    `` Dad , I 'll see you soon , '' she says , turning to leave .    I want to ask her , `` I 'm sorry , honey , it 's okay , it 's all fine . I knew you were here . ''    She 's sobbing more than she 's intended to .    `` I know , honey , I just loved you too . I guess . Well , thanks . ''    She looks at me again , `` I 'll see you soon . '' As she looks at me closely , her tears become visible , and the lights dim .    
`` Look , please , I 'm gon na see what this is . ''   `` The fabled black dragon is going to kidnap me ... I mean , tell you everything , and you 've got to be brave ! '' I said , my mouth opened , my mouth opened , and I breathed a deep sigh of relief .   `` Sorry , I mean , I did n't like it . This is NOT a part of the game , right ? ! ''   My voice muffled by the thump of thundering in the cave . `` Well , the fabled black dragon is just giving me a warning . This is my boss , the monster is a bit of a bitch . I mean , he is an honest man . He is a little fickle . It 's a trap . ''   `` Well , how about our quest ? Well , your quest is almost up to me . I 'm guessing that I 'm gon na be kidnapped by the mighty black dragon ! I do n't know you 're a monster ! ''   `` No , I do n't know what to do , but we are getting caught . I 've been getting in the dungeon for the past decade ! I 'm sure that this would hurt . ''   `` Hm , okay . ''   `` There 's this weird woman running the castle across a mountain ! What is a little fickle in the middle of the night ? Or has she been killed ... ? ''   `` Nothing , nothing . Her apron is a little fickle . She wo n't tell anyone . She usually just wo n't tell anyone he likes or something . ''   `` It 's a game , dummy . ''   `` Okay , I guess . Just a little trick . I have something to do with her , and more importantly , to *see* . She 'll be in a few days . ''   `` What ? Why the hell are you even calling **The Dragon now ? ** ''   `` Well , I 'm really thinking about that for now . Just a little trick to find out at work ? I 'll get your help , and then I will be sure to get to the dragon . ''   I sat back down , my head hurting a bit . I could n't move , I could n't move . I could n't move .   `` Ok ... I 'll be there . We 'll get you into the cave and then you 'll be there . ''   `` I know . ''
`` ... And you in the middle of the day , Canada won the war again . ''  It was a cold cold winter morning , and he wore headphones on . He opened the door and sat on the couch . The President of the United States was terrified of being eaten . He looked up and saw a man standing by the window . He was wearing a black suit and a black suit . Well , he was definitely trying to hide in the shadows .  `` How have you not been able to explain this ? ''  `` ... You 'll be here soon . ''  `` A Canadian ? '' said the President , `` You should have been able to explain it first . ''  `` What makes you an Australian ? ''  `` ... You 'll be here soon . ''  Now it was over time to prepare the aliens . The Aliens made no move .  The President of the United States would be the first to make the decision with no-one . Or you . He would have to act very smoothly to the Americans , but this man was n't trying to kill him . They did n't need to be attacked . So , he took a bite of the banana and he had another bite . It was a good bite at best .  The General started chanting . The president of the United States in a strange accent made his speech slightly difficult to read , `` ... What is that ? ''  `` Um ... I 'm afraid of this attack , sir . The United States is in a state of panic , and we do n't think we 'll be able to stop it . ''  `` Well ... you said I 'm not done yet . The United States is in panic . We 're not prepared . ''  `` Hhm ... Yes ! ''  The President was n't sure what to say . Someone to hear .  But the President of the United States was still surprised by what he was talking about . If this man did kill him there was nothing to do . The President was still shocked by that .  `` We 're not ready , do n't we ? ''  `` Yes ! We 'll be here shortly . ''  The president looked at the President . He was in disbelief .  Someone to speak to .  `` So ? ''  `` Oh , yes . We are ready . ''  The President smiled .  The President was going on , to become the President of the United States .
I wrote a pretty stupid story this year . I 'm actually going to go and see if I 'm trying to be a writer , it 's basically my first time doing something , and if I do n't mind , I 'm going to write something new .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   It was a nice day in the world . It was a nice day , but instead of one of the many jobs , the same job was good . It was something called my favorite of my own , I 'd eat , I had n't seen anything like it before , and just because I *needed* to sleep .   But it was bad .   And so I slept .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The days started like a normal day . I was home and lived . I was happy one day , and everything was alright . I was happy one day , and that I 'd be happy one day . I went home and did n't need to go . Instead I went home and went to bed , and ate . I did n't need to go through my homework so I ran , and did n't have to worry much . I went to my school , and left my homework . But a few went by , and I stayed in my school for a few more months .   I went to work , and there was a knock on the door . I was there , in the hallway , as I went to investigate . I was angry , and I was n't sure if I was watching or not . I ran very quickly , and I was scared . It was dark outside , and the door was dark outside . I saw a man in a blue jacket , with the brown jacket , his pants . He looked like the owner of the house , and I saw him . I looked over to him , and as I was about to take a step back , I noticed that I was suddenly standing there , and a man in the red coat . He said something , and then , `` What 's going on ? ''   I walked over to him , and froze . From my right hand , I saw him , and then I saw him .   He looked up around , he was dead , and saw a person standing on the grass . He looked like something in the middle of someone 's house . It was a woman , with the black coat , standing beside him . I looked at the woman , and then said , `` It 's ... I think it 's a woman of some kind , and that 's what 's going on . ''   He then looked up at me , and looked up at me . `` Well , there 's that woman in the red coat , and with the black hat , I 'm going to get me to the local store . ''   I stopped by the door and walked out . It was dark outside , and I could see the girl , and I could n't see who she was staring at .   Without warning , I opened the door . She smiled . `` I 'll let you in . ''   I looked at her and said , `` Okay , like , I 'll give you the best stuff . Just like , I 'll be there . ''   He nodded at me and ran away . He grabbed the woman . `` I think I 'll get you to the store ! '' And then he left .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The night was nice . I went to the store and got to work . I started to get the best stuff I could do , but I did n't want to go back to work anymore . I started to turn around . I started to tell her to leave , but she left me .   She got to the shop , `` Where 's your kid , '' she said to me , and then I saw the woman . I looked at my mom and turned
The lights of a high ceiling lit up the alleyway as the rain started to rain , and the wind beat back against the asphalt , signaling the other side of the alley .   “ Why are you laughing ? ” One of the four men called to the man .   “ I ’ m not . It ’ s just a little white . Do you know what it is ? ” A young man named Mark and Mark said to the man who had been in line around the front of the alley .   “ Well , some people laugh . But I don ’ t even know how much I hate my girlfriend. ” Mark said , voice trembling with fear .   “ Oh , she ’ s so beautiful . I love her so much . She has a huge face for all of that. ” Mark said , his voice still shaking .   “ I know . She ’ s not happy about me . She ’ s happy about me. ” Mark said , his words reverberating like iron .   “ Maybe ? I really need to tell you . I want to tell you something. ” Mark said , looking to the man who had just walked up , and walked closer to the man who had stopped in line . The man gave it a quick hug and continued towards Mark .   “ Hey , Mark . I ’ m sorry. ” Mark said , breaking into silence .   “ But you want to tell me you ? ” Mark said , voice quivering as he looked over at Mark for a second .   “ Yeah , it ’ s funny. ” Mark said back , and turned back to the stranger who sat at the back of the alley .   “ Why ? I really love my girlfriend . I ’ m not . I ’ m not happy about her anymore . I ’ m just happy about her. ” Mark said , lifting his arm to remove a small metal tube from his shoulder .   The man walked up to the man who had been walking through the alleyway and then turned to look at him .   “ I should probably give you a look . But here ’ s where it is. ” Mark said , walking back over to the man who had been walking to the side of the alleyway .   Mark stopped suddenly , staring at nothing . “ What happened ? ” He asked , frowning .   “ I don ’ t think it ’ s just that I can ’ t tell you what it means . That ’ s the closest thing I ever had. ” Mark said , his hand reaching for his chin .   “ No. ” Mark said , extending the tube .   Mark nodded . “ I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t tell you . Just a coincidence , right ? If I told you she ’ d like me to see you. ”   “ Well , she looks fine , maybe ? ” Mark said , looking directly at the man who was gone .   “ Yeah , she ’ s right . She ’ s the one who just let me tell you . And I guess she can ’ t tell you what I am talking about. ” Mark said , dropping the tube to his stomach .   “ What ? ” Mark said .   “ No . She ’ s beautiful . And I ’ m not . You know , it ’ s not perfect . Because she ’ s beautiful . She ’ s beautiful. ” Mark said , looking out the window .   “ She looks beautiful , and I ’ m the one who wanted to tell you anything . And I ’ ve been doing it for years and I ’ ve been doing it for years. ” Mark said , and then his words came out on the news . He looked to Mark , then to the man who had been walking by .   “ Mark. ” Mark said , placing his hand on the tube .   “ I love her . But I can tell you what she wants. ” Mark said , holding the tube up to him .   “ Are you sure ? ” Mark asked , walking to the door to the man who had walked the way through .   Mark smiled again . The man had stepped back in line to the man and said that Mark was waiting for Mark as he walked at the door .   “ Where are you ? ”
`` What time ? '' I asked , finally finding myself struggling to feel the air . My vision was blurred and my vision blurred at the same time . So far I could tell what to do , but there was no light . I tried to move my head to look at my surroundings I could see a different . The surroundings were white , or at least more like a room before , but no darkness was slowly creeping through . Oddly , no dark . I moved my hand and felt my arm feel the warmth .   A small , slim , square shaped object appeared nearby . I turned to see a human sitting on a bench , in a strange chair . The man 's eyes were wide and he looked like he saw a huge glass tube floating in front of me . I looked at it and realized I had an answer .   `` What ? '' He replied , turning to me and walking towards the object . I glanced at him confused .   `` What was that thing ? '' I asked , not wanting to make sense of what to do . `` Where is it ? ''   `` It 's very heavy here , but you can never get out of the chair even longer . ''   `` What 's that ? '' He asked , looking to his left , and eventually looking at the tube I had in my hand , `` Is that it ? ''   `` I know . '' I replied , somewhat perplexed .   He pointed at me , `` What is it ? Is it *life* ? ''   `` Is it *Death* ? '' he asked , raising his eyes to look at me .   `` Very specific . '' I responded , my voice rising for a brief moment and I paused .   `` I remember . '' He said , looking at me with a mouth full of tears . `` What does it mean ? ''   `` What 's that about ? '' I blurted .   `` Well , you 're not talking about this in this room . '' He said , his voice growing more annoyed . `` Well , then why do you need to explain it ? ''   `` You 're wearing the same uniform uniform . '' I responded , hoping to be somewhat worried . He shrugged , then continued , `` I 'm going to get that . ''   He started to stare at me , when he noticed a short metal tube , then suddenly looked at me , `` I 'm dead . I 'm a human , and the same metal tube that I had in my hand , with nothing else . They 're not . We 're dead , you really do . It needs to be done . ''   `` Do you mean *Death* ? '' I asked , hoping to be joking by the rest of the conversation . `` Where is your clothes ? ''   `` Because I 'm alive . I do n't even remember anything . I do n't recall anything . '' He started staring at me , but I could n't help but chuckle . His expression seemed to leave his features almost tangible . `` I 'd rather die like I do . ''   `` And then what do you mean ? '' I asked .   `` Just , you 're alive . You do n't remember anything . I do n't remember anything . '' He replied , still looking at me , `` I do n't remember anything . I do n't remember anything , and I do n't remember anything . I do n't remember anything . ''   `` I remember everything . I remember everything . Everything . Everything . All of this . All of this . All of this . All of this . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything else . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything . Everything .

Rude was awake . Maybe he was dreaming , or that was it , perhaps it was or because he was awake .   He was just in front of the room , a man standing in front of a small white coat , covered in yellow . `` I apologize for your loss , but I did do n't have time for this . ''   `` What ? '' he asked between his teeth . No word came out , he was beginning to understand . `` It 's not too long now . ''   He was suddenly aware of a man in a white coat . Around him , a man with white scrubs were standing in front of him . An old man , slightly overweight , wearing a black coat , and a slightly overweight , bald head , wore a black coat . Somehow , it was just about a foot from the man after the man had died .   `` I guess I should have been dead for long , '' the man said , and though he was not quite sure if he meant any words , he knew he needed to know what was going on .   `` Would you like to speak to me right now ? '' the man asked , holding a clipboard .   `` I do n't know . I guess I should have spoken to you right now , '' the man said , and while he did , he put his hand over his mouth to let the nurse know his name .    The man took a seat on the front chairs , and with a slight smile , he turned and nodded loudly , `` I guess I 'll guess that a lot of things will be able to do . ''   
This is my first time writing this while I wrote this while I 'm writing it , in the middle of the night with me hanging off the top shelf . For me I started this after all ... this was some fantasy . It was in my imagination .   I started this after yesterday , and I figured I 'd be dead by now . I was driving home , but I hit it off the night before . I knew that I could n't be dead by now .   I was walking up the bus to my closet , trying to ignore it but I could n't . In the same dark alley I was standing in the middle of the road . I was lying down next to the other side of the street . I smiled back and smiled at the street I had n't seen before . I grabbed the phone and a bit of it was n't quite sure if I needed to go to the bottom drawer .   I was startled by the sight of the large box that I had been staring at , and I was in a lot of trouble with my own gun on the ground .   I walked over to the edge of the road and pulled out several small pistols with the same thought , and sat down next to the box .   The box started moving , and I held it back up , as I had grown accustomed to it . I started to feel confused , and wondered how long I had been here . I still felt uneasy with each thing , but I turned around to see a large box lying on the ground directly next to me .   If the box kept moving , I would have never seen it again . But then a little girl with blue eyes was pointing a gun at me .   There before me was a knock at the door behind me . I turned to look at her , and then the girl was holding her face . I was lying down next to the box , looking at the floor . `` Who are you ? '' The girl asked , looking back at me . `` Who are you ? '' I asked . `` I am your friend . ''   I laughed , for a few moments , but then I heard her voice . `` Am I yours ? '' she asked , trying to take the gun from her .   `` Do you know who you are ? '' I asked , her voice cracking . `` No , I am yours . ''   She looked at me , confused . `` I am your friend . I am my friend . I am the only one who has left me . The only one who , who ... ''   I pulled the trigger from my pocket and pointed the gun at her . She backed away from the box and took a deep breath .   I looked at her . She looked at me , frozen in place , but still confused . `` What are you talking about ? ''   Before I knew it I could tell she was crying she looked at me , and then at me . `` I do not know what you do . '' She looked around the corner of her eyes , and whispered in a whisper : `` I am your friend . I am your friend . You are your friend . No one else . ''   I laughed at her . `` What ? Who are you ? You are your friend . ''   She ran towards me . `` You did not know . ''   I lowered my gun , the gun to my head and she laughed . `` I was your friend . I was your friend . '' She grabbed my hand and shot me directly in the chest . She pulled me up and took a deep breath , and as I did she was gone .   I felt very confused , and then I opened the door .   Not only could I have caused it to open . I opened the box and I was gone . My fingers were shaking just a little , and then I saw a white box . It was a piece of paper , and with a simple blue font , he sat down in front of me . I decided to read it to her , and she smiled .   `` Hello there . I am your friend . '' She said before picking up the paper and placing it back on the ground .   I began to put it back on its arms . I slowly looked at the paper and realized it must have been written in it . It was written in scribbles , all in a language I had written in it . I placed the paper back onto the ground , and felt myself .   I placed it back on the ground .   It was the paper . It looked at me , and then at me . It was written in the middle of the paper , and that was written again .
The class was quiet . As usual , the first lesson was over . The teacher was a husky , unspoken voice , and although he rarely listened .   `` Mr. Evans , get over here . '' he replied , but there was a slight pause . `` I have a program for you to do with a program for your past and future . ''   The rest of the class sighed . `` Why do n't you listen ? We 're a big , dark kid . We 've got ta go , and so can you , Mr. Evans , go to the back and play some games ? '' The rest of the class responded , but the teacher stayed silent .   `` Because , those are the ones who still listen to the computer '' replied Mr. Evans , who was already out of his element .   `` Oh , sorry , my parents were such a bit angry , or worried '' he mumbled , not realizing that he had already opened the program and started packing a few of the other classes . As he finished packing the other students left , the next three of them stood up .   The desk was empty . Not a single one was sure who this particular assignment was .   `` Oh , hello there '' yelled the teacher , which was in a little less than a couple of minutes before he had finished setting the phone on the desk and heading back to his computer .   `` Mr. Evans , I want to go to the front of the school. `` Mr. Evans responded .   `` Mr. Evans , thank you for taking your classes back . I need your help , just go back to class and talk . '' Mr. Evans started walking home to work and he was in the back room that morning .   The bell rang again , and Mr. Evans took his stuff then opened the door . There was a single , metallic panel in one side .   `` Mr. Evans , what are you doing ? You 're such a smart kid , not even smart . How about you get on the computer , huh ? '' he asked .   `` You are like 1,700 , Mr . Evans , let 's talk to us . '' The door opened and Mr. Evans looked down at his watch . It read 1,000,200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
Sighing , I walked past and sat in my front cell , eyes wide as if daring me to move .   `` Really ? ''   `` Um… Well , I 'm not getting any ahead of you , but I think it 's really quite like that , but I- ''   `` No , I was just planning on doing this to us , '' I tried to interrupt him . I had lost track of who he was , and I had been here for over a decade , and now he was finally back .   `` You can keep going , '' I said . `` I suppose I will , but I want to go on then , so I can start running . I do n't have much time to watch . ''   The cell was more comfortable with the fact that everyone had already entered the room . At the end of the hallway , a pair of heavy steps , one hand moving back and forth . He spun around and grabbed me by the throat . We both fell back , as if taking up the whole floor in a frenzy . I followed suit as best I could , and felt a surge of adrenaline through the veins of my body .   `` I 'm not going to let you either , '' I said . `` I want to go on , and I think it 's the opposite you all are . ''   My head shook as I asked him what he was doing . He turned around and gestured to me , `` No , no , do n't make them go , no , just do n't make them go back . ''   I looked up at him . He was staring at me , fear in his hands , and fear in his voice . He tried to slow down . I put away the same thought he had ever been trained to say . He looked at me sympathetically . His eyes narrowed .   `` What do you think of me ? '' He asked .   `` Well , I think I 'm going to join the army . ''   `` And I 'm going to have my hands in my pockets , '' the man said . `` Alright , thanks , '' He flipped down the volume and turned back to me . `` Here it is . ''   I turned around , but found myself drifting through a thick cloud of dust . I had been on for about 20 years now , and I had n't realized what had happened .   `` Thank *you* , '' I said . `` I 'm not gon na let you go , though . ''   He looked at me . `` Okay , okay . Very well . So you can stop me . I think I 'm gon na have to stop you from putting me in my pocket before I go to my cell . ''   `` Wait , '' I said . `` Good . ''   `` Wait . What ? I.. I 'm just hoping ... what 's going on ? ''   He turned and began to walk away .   I walked into the hall , and saw him sitting down . He was holding a book , half asleep , and sitting up where he was . I nodded , and I was alone . I turned around to see if he could hear us . He looked up at the book , and I saw the book on the wall .   `` How long have you been here ? '' He said . `` My name is Samuel , '' he said . `` Do you have any idea where I came from ? ''   He turned around and faced me . `` Uhm . ''
`` State your crime and defense against the jurors , you are hereby charged for the crimes that lay in a bowl of cereal , '' Billy spoke up . The defendant leaned against the bailiff , and let out a sigh . `` It 's not that easy , it just is n't that hard to get . The fact remains that you 're going to have only served a bowl of cereal , '' Billy observed .   `` It 's the only thing you deserve , really . '' The bailiff breathed . `` You just have to see how many people have survived this trial . '' Billy looked down at his hands , `` It 's only because of your past sins . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` Judge , let 's see how the judge is going to commit such a heinous deed . Does n't matter how much you have left me to commit , we have to do this justice . It 's just the way his life still is . ''   Billy looked around to see his lawyer . A man he seemed to be wearing a white shirt with a black shirt and a green shirt . The man began to tremble at the sight of him , but he could n't move his legs . He began to roll it over to the bailiff 's side . He began to sob even more .   `` The jury is trying to force a jury to take a jury to the jail . '' Billy looked around to see if anyone else was really interested . He looked around to see that the defendant was standing at least an inch away from him . He saw two men with a pink shirt with two blue stripes . They looked at him and then he began to flinch .   `` The defendant is getting impatient . '' Billy screamed . `` I already just wanted the justice and your future . '' They watched , and then they were gone . Billy watched .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   **Inhale**
`` Hey , I 'm fine , '' the receptionist said , a small beep from the left , a girl in the corner of the room . She smiled sadly and smiled , a little puffy droplet drooling out of the thin air .   `` Hi , '' she said , a small smile creeping across her face .   The receptionist 's head spun and she smiled , showing off the pink and brown hair that had to be hanging off her back .   `` Do you suppose it 's a 'excuse ' ? '' she asked .   The receptionist smiled back and smiled , and the receptionist gave a warm smile , nodding with a warm smile . She smiled back at the line the receptionist took in her hand , and the pink arm waved in a gesture of reassurance . Her smile quickly faded and she felt a warmth go up her spine , and she nodded .   -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The receptionist 's expression widened , and she smiled back at the receptionist , smiling as she looked at the green , happy smile that had made her smile at the sight of her .   `` Are you alright ? '' he asked .   `` Yes . ''   As the receptionists finished walking up to the receptionist , *Oh , I missed my chance . *   They sat down for a while before returning to the seat , enjoying the warmth of the morning .   -- -- -- -- --   The receptionist took a bite of her sandwich and the interview came to a halt .   `` Hi , I-I 'm so alright , '' she said , a smirk turning her face towards the receptionist .   `` Would you mind if you 'd enjoyed a little to sit down ? ''   The receptionist turned to face the receptionist , and the smile seemed to light up . `` Do you know what your name is ? '' She asked , a little disappointed .   `` I 'm a weird guy . ''   -- -- -- -- --   So , you 're just looking at the green , smiling , smiling , as the smile on the receptionist 's face grew wider .   `` Oh my , '' she said , `` I have an important meeting with you . I suppose this is no different from the outside . So I 'm finally looking for these things you need just to find me here . The good stuff is over . ''   `` This is a bit ridiculous , '' she said , putting a few of her nails in her face . `` I 'm only going to wait until I get to see you . ''   The receptionist smiled . `` Maybe that 's what I 'm supposed to do with it . ''   `` I 'm not , '' she told the receptionist . `` I 'm just sitting on this plane , waiting for the trip to come to a different conclusion . ''   The receptionist gestured to a large woman in her seat , and she looked from somewhere in the distance , to a nearby window .   `` Are you doing it ? ''   `` Sure , '' she said . `` I 'm fine , I 'll be there at the first place in the day . There 's a lot to do . Maybe that 's what I 'm supposed to do with it . ''   `` If I just want to see you , '' the receptionist said , smiling , walking forward .   `` That 's impossible , '' the receptionist said , smiling with warm cheeks , and nodding . `` Besides , there 's a lot to do with it . ''   The receptionist smiled back . `` I 'm just glad you 're home . I can tell you about that . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The receptionist 's eyes widened and she looked back at the receptionist . `` *I want to see you again , '' she said , smiling . `` I want to see you again . ''   The receptionist laughed , and nodded .   The receptionist kept her hand on the woman 's shoulder , and the receptionist 's face seemed to go dark .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The receptionist took her seat opposite of the receptionist , and the receptionist looked at the blue , a look . It looked like that .   `` It 's not a big deal , '' the receptionist said , smiling
The humans stood around the pearly gates of Heaven . A world filled with endless chaos , and then it felt like Heaven was in the back of a million souls .   `` Yes , I am God , '' he answered and they started to cry . `` I do n't know . ''   God smiled , and looked at his tiny , wrinkled face . `` No . I know we are all the creations . But I know you are all the ones who are so perfect . ''   God sighed . `` But ... ''   `` I know I am , '' God said . `` But if you wish to choose your role , we will become different . ''   They started to shout again . This time , one of the souls entered the crowd . When God walked in , he realized he was still screaming , and everyone was screaming .   `` What are you trying to say ? '' the one of the soul asked .   `` You do n't understand me . You want to have a purpose , '' God replied . `` I just want to have a purpose , a purpose , a purpose , a purpose . Everything , and everything . We have worked together and there ! The perfect new purpose , and it is so simple that you can fulfill a purpose , and all it takes is a purpose . Why are we all all the different ?   God looked up . `` Why do n't you call me omnipotent ? ''   The one who asked him the question .   `` Because everyone will . I 'm your creator . ''   God sat back up , and looked down at his tiny feet , and began to cry .   `` Because I do n't intend to be the first man that has created me . ''   God looked through the tears .   `` Why would that serve you ? Why would you become my creator , Michael ? ''   `` Because I can understand you . ''   God looked at his frail hands . `` Because I do n't even have time to go . ''   `` Why is I here ? I have no purpose . I had no purpose . I want this purpose . I am everything . I am the one who created me . I am everything . It is life . And I have no purpose . ''   `` And yet , all this is perfect ? ? ''   Him looked tired .   `` Because I am humanity . Just me . ''   God looked up . `` That 's why you chose me . I am the one who has created me . ''   God looked down at his tiny hands . `` That 's why I gave that purpose . And I know you have a purpose . And I understand you all . I could think of a purpose to live on and live on and like I said , and know you could do something important , and make someone else , or what else should be ? So , when a person person does n't want you to live alone , or what else should I do ? You all and I know you are mine . And I am all yours . ''   God shook his head . `` Yes , but you are all mine . It is mine . My purpose . And now I am all yours . And I am all yours . And my purpose . And I am all yours , and mine . As you are all yours . I am all yours . And I will be yours . And I will be you . And with you . You . And I will be everything . ''   God leaned in , and God sobbed . It felt like a thousand years ago . `` And there is nothing I can do about you . And there is nothing that will do to me . And just you . ''
The first thing I saw was that there was no other reason I could move . I 'd never actually experienced this sort of happening .   Then I realized that I was walking into a car . I 'd never been able to move . I knew I was driving , but I knew I was driving .   Then I saw what I had become . On the ground .   Slowly , I drifted off into darkness .   I never felt this fear .   The car doors opened , and a man with his head still running . I saw what I was in front of me . I was wearing a costume . I tried to ignore him , but he did n't seem to care . I stumbled , and , but I could n't feel my lips .   I got up . I walked around and he was gone .   I screamed . 
I am a real man . I have no idea who I am . I have no idea what I am talking about . I have no idea who I am , or what I am . I am alone . This is not my home . This is not my home . This is my home . This is my home . I am alone . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . I do not live alone . This must be my home . This is my home . I have no idea how to stay here . This may be my home . This is my home . This must be my house . This is my home . This must be my home . It is my home . This is the home . There is nothing . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This will be my home . This is my home . this is all home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . this is my home . This is not my home . This is my home . This is my home . I am alone . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . THIS is my home . I am alone . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This is my home . This was my home . `` This is all home . You are mine . '' 
The man 's face contorted in disgust as he ran at the dying man behind him . `` What was that ? '' He asked .   `` He was n't your sword , sir . ''   `` You 're a warrior , sir . '' A man 's eyes stared up at the man .   `` Do you have a sword , sir ? ''   `` I 'm sure , sir . ''   `` Yes , sir . This man was not your sword . ''   `` And how did he use this sword ? ''   `` He used it as a weapon , sir . ''   `` You 're a warrior . ''   `` Then why would he use this sword ? ''   `` Because you 're not a warrior , I 'm a warrior . ''   `` Because you 're not a warrior . ''   `` Because you 're a warrior . ''   `` Yet you 're not a warrior , sir . ''   `` And what 's right about that hammer ? ''   `` Because you 're an adventurer . ''   `` And who ? ''   `` You do n't even know me . ''   `` And why would you do that ? ''   `` Because my sword is not yours to give you -- ''   `` Because I 'd never trust my sword . ''   `` Is n't yours to give you a sword ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Then why would I sacrifice myself ? ''   `` Because your sword is yours to give you the sword . ''   `` Because you 're here to kill me , sir . ''   `` Because your sword is yours to tell me what you 're going to do as your sword is yours to tell you . ''   They were confused . The man 's expression grew as he watched the last man 's face fade . He did n't ask for any questions .
We both knew it was n't coming . The country had been destroyed for decades and a few days ( was it coming* ? Perhaps it was n't for us ? ) I wanted to save the world , and I could fix it .   The government had finally started to take shape . I would kill the enemy without being exposed to its own oppression and make my own little country become rich . I could n't afford to give up on the government and it would be right . I wanted to help the country , but nothing really changed . I could only save the world .   I lost those people , however , because one person would want a greater country , more innocent than I am for . I had lost those people .   I took those people in order to prevent the world from coming , and left them to work their way down the street when they would find them and begin to drive in to the streets with them .   I would be wrong before the entire world could take place . I would be wrong . I could n't have chosen my country to save the world .   I had been wrong . I needed to kill the world for him . I wanted to let him take advantage of me . I needed to do whatever people did . I needed to be wrong .   I could n't kill people . I needed to be better . I needed to be better if I tried . I needed to just kill the people who would listen to their story . I needed to be better . I needed more , something to be taken .   I needed people to make the world more perfect . I needed more , and I needed to survive . I needed to be better . I needed to know . I needed a better future .   I needed it , but it was n't much . I needed to be good . I needed some money .   I needed someone to protect them , so I could see just enough . That was right . I needed to be more .   I needed them to know . That made the world more perfect . Better . I needed them to know .   I needed to find the right place , to make the world better . I needed to conquer what had been done . I needed to take .   I needed to die . No world will fail . I needed to keep the people healthy .   I needed people to help . I needed to know . They needed to know .   I thought it was over . I needed to know .   I needed to know what my world would entail . I needed to know . I needed to protect the world , to be better . I needed to do what I needed .   I needed them to let me go . I needed to be good . I needed to be selfish . I needed to protect the world .   I needed to make them sick . I needed to stop the world . I needed to help !   I needed to be better .   I needed to tell what I needed . I needed to learn . I needed to stop it . I needed to know .   I needed to protect the world , but I needed to be better . If only I could have prevented this nation from coming to war . What if I could have saved millions ? How could I be wrong ?   I needed them done . I needed to take the world , but they needed us .   I needed to protect the world . Just like that .   I needed to know .   I needed to see what I needed .   I needed them to know . Not to kill the people who needed their help , for the greater good . To make it better .   I needed them to know .   I needed them to know . And I needed them to know .   I needed them to know . They needed us .   I needed to do what I needed . I needed them to know . They needed to know . They needed to know . They needed to know but one thing was wrong but I needed them to know . Their faith was in me . I needed them to know . I needed them to know , and they needed to know . They needed to know . They needed to know .   I needed them to know .   I needed them . I needed them to know .   I needed them to know . I needed them to know .   I needed them to know . I needed them to know . I needed them to know .   I needed them to know . I needed them to know they needed them to know . But they
*This is my first story , so I have a prompt I 've just received from an earlier story and here I am . *   Jane Doe was a woman named Abigail . She had brown hair , bright blue eyes , a deep purple beard . Everything had gotten out of her hand , but she was pretty beautiful . And that was the first thing this happened   That was the first time she saw Abigail . It was the same as she had always been .   She had tried throwing her arms around the man , and then she looked up the mountain of black . She couldn ’ t see him but she had been crying and crying . She cried . She didn ’ t believe it . When you were in a coma , there was no turning back . She was crying . Where did Abigail and Abigail go ? It wasn ’ t in her room anymore . It was over . There was a deep growl as Abigail ’ s lips pressed against the beast .   Then Alice was smiling . It was beautiful . But it had been three years since Abigail died .   She loved Abigail . That was the last time she could remember . It was her last hope .   That is when she realized that she was there . She was there . That was when she was there . She still struggled against the beast .   That is when the first . She was there .   It must be her dream , but the second time she remembered it she had been there .   *I will tell you something . *   Jane had been crying for a while , but when she was there . It was beautiful .   When the first time , she saw Abigail , he had never been there before . He must ’ ve been there for you .
It 's too late , I think , but I think I 'm going to have to do this .   But this is the right place , and I 'm going to have to wait for this day .   Finally , I 'm tired of this , it 's perfect . I ca n't stand to let myself believe that I have n't really accepted any of the necessary requirements of the muggle community . A few minutes before the problem goes wrong , and I 'm already going to ask the sorting hat out .   They 're just another dumb spot in the house .   I 'm going to get back to this place , and they have some kind of magical power .   And I 'm going to have to decide whether to use it or not . I 'm going to have to keep up with what Harry Potter meant to me , and that is how Harry 's plan will be to put my own hat out , but I hope to be able to get over with the whole thing .   I 'm going to have to start walking around , and I 'm going to have to wait for myself to let it in .   But that 's okay .   It 's time to get dressed . In fact , I 'm going to have to make a cup of coffee .
Nodding away from my desk , I noticed the message on my screen . I was a little confused .   `` I was going to call you a friend when I figured you had better luck with that . ''   `` I am not . ''   `` It was n't an easy trip . ''   `` Well maybe I could look at the message . I 'm going to pick that , right ? ''   `` Okay , I 'll see you soon . ''   `` Okay , fine . ''   I looked around the room , trying to figure something out , but it did n't help . I could hear my computer rolling onto screen , as if it was n't on the screen .   When I opened the door for the car , there was a large , shiny , golden silver , white box on its side .   I looked at it , then at it . It was blue in its green glory .   I quickly opened the box , opened it , and it was on top of its head , slowly resting perfectly on its side , extending its head , poking at a white button .   I blinked as the screen flicked , and then my eyes started to race . The only thing I could think about was my face , my eyes , ears .   Then , I turned the mouse up , moving it around slowly , inspecting it . A bit more bizarre than this , but I could feel my skin .   Just as the light in the universe faded , the light faded to black . My eyes closed again , and I opened them again .   The first thing I noticed was the shiny , gold , and silver as well . I was slowly walking toward the object , and my vision began to fade , then the object was gone . I looked at it , and it was over .   *What is it looking for ? ! *   Then , in the dimness of the object . On a screen there came a small red , black dot .   *What is it looking for ? ! ! *   The following seconds were the same .   *What is it looking for ? *   `` It appears ... it appears ... it seems ... ''   `` What the hell ? ''   I stared at it , as if someone was trying to see me , but it was no surprise .   `` Where are you ? ''   The next realization of what had happened , I looked at the bright blue paper again .   `` I ... I am , and I am ! ''   I looked back at the screen . It was blue in its red glory .   `` I ... I am . . The ... um ... ''   `` You 're ... ? ''   A single , red dot came off my screen .   `` I am . . . . the ... uh ... I am . the ... . the ... uh ... ... . the ... ... sirs ... . The red dot appears ... *that was ... uh.. . ... the ... uh ... . the ... uh ... one ... ? ''   I looked at him incredulously .   `` ... ... the ... ... um ... sirs ... . the ... ... um ... uh ... uh ... what ? ''   `` I have ... uh ... no ... Sirs ... sirs ... you ... . ''   He flipped it over and read `` JUM- ''   Suddenly , the letters became fuzzy . I could feel the power surge through my body . I slowly took out my PC , and began to scan it .   For what seemed like hours , I tried to move it , but it 's glowing white all around me .   I opened the box , turned around and started to write a story about the life of the the deceased and the deceased and the death of mankind .   Then , it hit me .
Beads of sweat trickling down my forehead as the rain dripped down my face with each step I took . He looked down at my arm as I left his room , and took off , taking over as the rain poured from his face .   He was right . That 's what I always say . I should have known , like last night . He was right , but at least it always had to happen . It matters though . One of those nights we spent together in the dark and the other feeling like they would never happen again . We were close , even though we could hear the sound of its voice again , the cold was so soothing .   Suddenly I felt my back slam against the pavement . My hands and ears were throbbing as the raindrops poured down my forehead . I was standing still , confused .   `` My ... . ''
I watched from across the hill and watched as a human . A child started walking towards the hill and the wolves kept walking , they followed him as they stalked past the trees . Then , I heard a sound as if someone had been following him . A woman was barking at me , saying nothing . `` No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , NO , no ! '' I did n't move .   Two months later , I was finally a human , and as I looked at the creature , I noticed that it was getting closer , it knew what I had to do . I could n't move . I had to act . No . It had to do . I had to move without moving .   I lunged towards the girl , but she was too late . I grabbed her by the collar and pulled her back up . She was still yelling , but I could n't do anything . I pushed her back up against the bushes and she screamed . `` Please ! Please , just go go ! '' She did n't respond .   I grabbed her by the collar and pulled her back up towards me . I looked over and saw a woman that was n't in a good position .   She looked at me with an inquisitive look . `` It 's alright , I ca n't do anything here anymore . I do n't want the animals to talk about me anymore . They ca n't really talk to me anymore , I just have to make it out of here ... '' she trailed off , and I looked down at where the child was sitting , confused .   I opened my eyes and saw her . I had no expression for her . She looked at me with an inquisitive look on her face .   *But where did she say that ? * I asked as I tried to speak .   She was very quiet , very quiet . After a few seconds of hesitation , and she opened her mouth to respond . `` Why did she say that ? Why do n't I tell you that ? '' I asked .   She had no response .   `` Why do n't you tell me that ? ''   `` Because we kept going , that we kept going , and we kept going , because we wanted to know that this was the first time we 've been dating . We 're going to be together forever , and we 've been together everyday since , so this is n't the first time I 've come to see you , so please sign up , and please sign up , and continue . '' She did n't seem any quiet , so I put on my shirt and walked over to her .   She walked closer to me and she let go of me , and I started to follow her and followed her to the woods .
I sat alone in the room . The room grew restless so I looked upon myself and saw the other man standing at the front of the television . All of this time , I was so startled that I could feel my hands shaking as though I was being dragged out of the door and ran out of the room . I knew I should be here , but I was n't there . I felt like I was in this room .   It was just as bad as the old man , I was doing exactly the same to him . He was just as much as I should have known , and his skin was pale and brown . I looked down at his body , and then back at him . He had n't been tied to the chair at all , and his face looked like it was carved into a glass . His eyes were a wide blue . He looked like he was a man , his eyes were large and almost so large . A sickly man was standing in the middle , staring at me with his eyes wide with fear . I slowly moved my arm to my face , and the man on the ground spoke ,   `` I can know , I know , *you're* here . I know . I 've met your people . ''   His mouth opened wide . He was n't a man and smelled like it . He was like a deer , and he smelled like chicken .   I walked hurriedly out of the room and ran back to the room . He was kneeling down as if he made a move to grab something . He dropped the coffee , and then dropped the coffee on the floor . His eyes widened .   His face went wide .
`` Hey , my buddy , '' the man said .   She dropped the paper and pulled out a syringe . The man took it up , but it was still so much blood .   `` You sure ? '' the man asked .   `` Well , I know . And that 's why you 're getting this sorted out . ''   `` Yeah , but ... '' the man said .   `` What a simple `` yes '' . ''   `` And it 's why I 'm here . ''   `` Well , you have something to do with it . ''   `` Well , it 's a lot of work , but it 's not like I 'm gon na do anything better . ''   `` Look , I have a gun to fill up . ''   `` Huh , I 'm just gon na need a replacement . I 'm gon na be damned . ''   The man looked at her . `` So what 's going on ? ''   `` Uh , yeah . You see , I 'm gon na be damned if not for the first time , '' the man said , and handed the syringe back . `` It 's ... you know what- ''   `` Yeah , right , I 'll be *barking* to take my life . I *want* a replacement . It 'll hurt . ''   `` So you 're gon na be a replacement ? '' the man said , handing the syringe back to her .   `` And that 's why you 're here . '' The man took a swig from the syringe , dropping it onto the floor . The man watched as the syringe burned into the floor .   `` Oh , well , there 's more . ''   `` Cool . '' The man said . The man took the syringe to his lips , and the man looked up at the little girl . `` Do n't you think I 'm going to shoot anything ? ''   The girl nodded and pointed at the syringe .   The man looked down at the little girl who looked down at the syringe . She looked at the little girl who pulled it off the floor .   `` So , why are you here ? '' The girl asked .   The man shook his head suddenly , and the girl looked up at the girl who had hit the floor . The girl looked down at the little girl who looked down at the blood soaked floor . A young girl looked up at the girl . `` I can tell you that you are n't going to fight with a replacement . ''
It was a regular night of night . I sat across from my mother , the sun rising slowly as the planet lights up in the night sky . A dark blue cloud filled the sky , but not in my light . The sky was black and white , and a planet entirely different .   I looked at myself as I walked in . I began to explore the surroundings . There were some type of dark and ancient structures nearby . There were buildings , the walls , the wall , the walls , the buildings , that were covered in old filth . I looked around and saw one of the people , which were still making their way to the other nearby buildings . I could see it in the distance , but I did n't see it .   After a few minutes , I finally noticed the small ship sitting there with its huge arm wrapped around the wall , covered in dried blood . I stood up , and walked to the other side of the building . I followed it , but then I saw a man with a gun pointed at me . He was wearing a suit . I did n't like this attire , but I could n't do it with my finger .   I took a deep breath and let out a small `` Hello ! '' when I looked up the man from the chair . He was wearing a suit that looked like something with skin not too long gone . I walked around the room to the other side of the building and came down to look at the dark brown-haired man with the gun pointed pointed at his faceplate . He looked at me and smiled as he pointed at the man .   `` Hello ? '' he said as he pulled out his gun . `` I 'm sorry to bother you . ''   I replied , `` I-I 'm sorry . ''   He shot me in the chest . He turned to face me . `` You seem fine , but you 've only been here since I last saw you ... Well , I 'm sorry to bother you . ''   I looked at him , and then noticed the man staring behind the gun .   `` So ... I guess this is n't where I am now , young lady , but you are a *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *woooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo* *wooo*   I looked at the man and smiled as he shook his head .   `` So ... '' he said as he pointed at me .   I looked , and my mother walked away . What was she talking about ? She looked up at me , and then back to me with the gun to her chest .   `` What ? '' I asked , `` Are you serious ? ''   She slowly looked over at me . She was holding a pistol . Then she started to sob , and then back again , and again , `` It 's ... ''   `` I 'm sorry , babe . I 'm sorry . ''   She stopped sobbing in her tracks , and then shook her head . `` I 'm sorry , '' she said . `` I 'll be okay . '' I looked at her , and she made a move .   `` Not terribly loud at all . I 'm sorry , but ... '' She took the gun away , `` but I wo n't . I 'm just ... ''   `` No . '' I said , `` you 're okay . It 's just very lonely . '' I looked at her . `` I 'm not that kind of sad ... but I do n't like it anymore , if you can leave life behind , and you can go back and look for them . ''   She looked at me , and then at her chest . `` You really were n't sad then , baby . ''   I looked at her , confused . `` Look , honey , we have something here . ''   She took a step back , and lowered her weapon . `` I remember ... I was ... I do n't know . '' she said . `` Do n't tell me , honey . I 'm not really sadder ... but that I 'm sad . ''   She gestured towards me , and the gun pointed at me , and then dropped to the ground . She fell flat , and then screamed . I watched her cry
I stood still , staring at the ceiling . The air barely moved - the walls were slick with sweat . The window had broken ! I looked around , making sure nobody else was there , but their furniture was old , and not here , it was now . I kept my gaze on the floor so that I could hear them , my knees were shaking and their faces were filled with tears . I let out a deep breath , and the words escaped my mouth as I pushed my way over to the window . Basket must have been in my arms , but there were still nothing to worry about .   I looked back at the window , and could n't see the tear forming a deep red streak across his cheek . A small , raspy voice said , 'You 're not going to do this . '   I looked up , and the pain in my stomach was gone . I had to stop . Or so I thought . At least today , I thought . I closed my eyes slowly , and gave the sound of breathing . Finally , I heard a voice again . I looked over , and saw it 's mouth open , mouth shut . I looked over , and heard a voice again , 'I 'm sorry ! I did n't need to . I had to make this . '   I turned to the window and saw my friend 's hands , and his hands were shaking . I looked back at him , and found this was a prank , a prank .   I stood on the ground , and opened my eyes . The police officer 's hands had been shaking , and I could see an old man 's face .   I looked up . I heard a heavy sigh , and a sudden fear washed over me like a tsunami . I looked at my buddy again , and saw that he was not making progress . He was the middle of the street , and had n't even looked at me . It was a house on the other side of the street . I made sure to keep my eyes on the man . He turned around , and the two held out their hands in front of his face , and he shook them again . I turned back around and saw the older man who had made progress .   `` Hey dad , '' I said , `` I 'm hungry , '' my eyes watering . I pulled out my phone , and saw that the man was there , but they had no idea what was going on . I opened it . I could smell the warm smoke outside , and I saw that I could smell the burning burning burning inside of me now . My stomach churned at the thought , but I knew that it was a trick . I ran towards the bedroom , and swung the door open . I heard several heavy knocks come from the hallway , and I ran out of the house .   I came to the door , and it was locked . I walked over to the door . I looked at the man , and noticed that his gaze was a deep red .   `` Your blood , '' I said , `` I 'm sorry , I wo n't let you die . Let me go . ''   I put my phone down , and started walking toward the door . I did n't bother for the man . I followed him , and ran to the door . I picked up the knife , and grabbed it . I was at the door , and realized that my friend was not here . The man wore a simple silver and red hat , and the wooden handle was the same color as me . Well , there was something in his eye , he had a green hat , and he was dressed like a black shirt made of paper .   `` Hey dad , '' he said . `` How the hell did you get here ? ''   A small , brown hat , and a green hat , made of paper , and just that the man wore a red hat , and his face was covered in red .   `` I told you , '' he said , `` That 's when you need to stop . ''   I ran to the door , and shut the door . The door opened and I saw that my friend had just moved out of the room . I was right there , and there he was . I smiled , and I saw that he was there . I smiled .   The guy was smiling , and he took away the hat , and let out a loud sigh . It was a while later that my friend came , and I was in an awkward stance . I looked up at the small brown hat and saw that it was still smoking , and I looked at my friend .   `` Okay '' said the man . `` Your blood is still drying . ''   `` I know , '' I said , `` I have to make this happen ,
The door opened and a man walked into the elevator .   He was dressed in a black shirt and a tight sweater , a small wooden dress with large white buttons and a golden crossbow shaped crossbow . The man looked down hard . Standing in front of him was a man wearing some sort of suit , with a short red crossbow on front of his cheek . The man was wearing a large black suit , with a silver bow sticking out his chest . The man looked up , but then he looked at the man and thought `` Thank you '' , and said `` I 'm so glad to see that it will be a lie , but only when I can give you some time . ''   He nodded , and said `` When did I get out of here myself ? ''   The man looked up and down to the man to see whether it was actually a woman or a girl . `` I 'm not sure why my wife is here , but I believe she does n't want to . ''   The man nodded . `` Sorry , because the people here are really pretty happy about that . At least it sounds bad , but we can never keep our secrets safe now . ''   He looked up again and said `` Sorry , do n't worry . If I just give you a few time , it 's just me , and you 'll hear me . ''   The man sighed , and walked away .   The man was quiet for a few seconds all his time , but then a rasp came from behind the elevator and he was sure it was his second time . When he walked in he noticed how much the doors were closed and he looked down to see the man , who was sitting next to him . The man said `` Sorry '' and then walked towards the man , but then stopped by a small door and walked in . It was a man , a small man with a long scar on his cheek . He yelled `` I could n't believe you '' and then she said `` I 'm glad to know where I am , and what else I will do ? ''   `` I can '' and gave some time `` If I do n't want the police to know how to stop me . ''   The man walked away quickly , and opened the door to the man . The other man was wearing a black suit , a thin man with a long black suit and a trench coat and some kind of military insignia that just showed a massive black box with a large red button on top .   The man took a small bow and said `` Wait , do n't worry , I 'll tell you exactly what happened and tomorrow , what are you doing here ? ''   The man continued walking towards the man . He walked away , and he came to his senses , and immediately he felt a cold sweat on his brow . The man was staring at the big man before he could respond but then came to a realization of what had happened .   There was something in the man 's pocket of the watch , and he started searching the watch again .   Suddenly a loud bang came from behind him and he felt a huge amount of sudden pain in his arm . For an instant , he felt the man 's forearm go cold . He screamed , and then he saw a small blood stain on his chest , and then realized why he had n't lived comfortably . The man looked up to see a man stood up , and reached out to touch his ear . He let go of his hand , and then slowly turned his head , and then a cold drop fell over the man . He closed his eyes and looked up , but then he saw the bright blue light emanating from the inside of the room . He felt a hand brush against his temple with a quick motion .   The man grabbed a large rifle and started shooting towards the man . The man felt a strange sensation in his neck . He touched a small red button in the ceiling . He looked up slowly , and then the light went to the same angle , only to reveal a small man . He started to feel a trickle of blood drip down his neck , then he felt a trickle of blood running down his body , then he felt the blood trickle down his right thigh . He saw a gun running off his head . He felt a warmth on his left arm , and quickly heard a voice in his ear , `` I 'm so sorry , I 'm very sorry , but I 'm so sorry , I 'm so sorry , but why are you so sad ? ''  ___________________________________________________________________________________   A half hour passed with the man and a girl and a woman . They were married and married and there were 7 people . Their family was married and they were their daughter , and it was n't their
The day was a blur of color and light .   I sat at the foot of the wooden stairs of my apartment , arms crossed around the waist of my back . The white glow of my face and face , was a beautiful face with a simple grey dress and skin .   It was a woman that stood at the edge of the floor in front of me . She sat on a ledge below her bed , her body draped tightly around her shoulders . A man , with only a few eyes that kept the man in his wake .   His face was pale , the light of the night sky was as deep as its . The room was covered in the red light . A picture of a man with a broken face stood beside him .   I sat in the corner . It was a young woman , with a slightly darker complexion , but pale . Her hair had gone , her eyes did not look through it . The woman smiled back at me , a smile on her face . `` It 's been years for you . ''   The woman looked up at her , a smile plastered across her face . `` My name is Alex . '' She said she disappeared into a black ocean . She sat up , a glass bottle in front of her . I felt silly to say something .   A man stood there , looking over a little girl . His eyes bore red . He wore his jacket , and his eyes began to bulge on mine . She had never seen him before . `` Do n't worry , you wo n't have to worry about anything . '' She said , standing up . `` I 've tried to see you again . ''   The woman nodded . `` There is no time to worry about anything . I 'm sorry . '' She turned back towards the door , and I realized she was walking toward me .   She was sitting next to me , not touching our feet . Her dark curls were tied around her back and her head was slumped in a knot . `` I 'm so sorry , I 'm sorry . I just wanted to know . '' Her voice was still , but her voice echoed around me . `` I remember this time you 've been in my little room . I was always the same and I 'm so sorry , but I 'm so sorry . ''   I took up my hoodie and began to speak . `` It only took forever to realize what happened , but I do n't know how to stop time . ''   She fell into my arms , her arms wrapping around her shoulders . I looked to my left and I noticed that she was standing behind . She looked back to the window , and saw that she was covered in blood . `` It 's ok , you 're so sorry . I tried to stop time . I just wanted to stop time and stop time , but I ca n't stop time . I 'm so sorry . ''   Her face turned into a frown . `` I love you . '' She said , and her words drifted into the room .   It was n't the girl that stood at the back of my apartment . Her face was slightly red , but it was n't the woman she looked to be in . `` I LOVE you . I love you . I love you . '' She began to sob . I fell into the pillow .
The suit is black and all too dark .   You can wait to see the sun rise from the sky . It 's the same light as you , and it seems the same as you think it was just the beginning of the journey .   You step back into the blackness , when you hear the sound of crying . It does n't sound like you 're crying .   `` Fuck them , '' you mutter to yourself , before shaking your head .   You turn around , and look away . There 's a group of three men that did n't just let out a cry , and both were gone . It 's like a dream . We were only one survivor .   `` I 'm going to die , '' you say .   `` This is not what it was like ! '' You say .   `` Take care of this ! '' The group of men yell at you . You look away , and see the same faces . They look away , and disappear , until you have to remember them .   You look away , and find that they are holding out them all . He 's still holding onto the chest , and you are shaking from exhaustion . You 're so excited .   You take care of this group .
Lying away from the TV we all watched while people watched what we will be doing to get on the surface of the city . Everything we could do to prevent the zombies from appearing . People who had been infected seemed to be heading toward us , were now heading back to us .   Slowly we started to run towards what we would assume was an exit . Once we got there it stopped .   The first step was complete .   The first step was incredible . There was no way out . We ran to the nearest man and he started shouting .   He started screaming and screaming and screaming .   He started screaming but he stopped crying and was scared . Slowly we began running towards the exit .   Slowly we began walking towards the entrance .   The zombies started running , taking their arms in anticipation of what they see .   There were hundreds of zombies , hundreds and hundreds .   The next step was complete .   Each step was complete .   The first step , followed by a loud bang and it was almost as if a gunshot had been knocked down .   Slowly we crept towards the back of the van and looked behind us .   There was a long silence .   Then we realized . The first steps were a little fuzzy to us , but it looked like the wall behind us .   Then the screams stopped .   Slowly we were walking towards the center of the road .   The second step was complete .   The first steps were so massive the second step was slowly slowing now slowing .   Slowly the second step became faster and faster and faster .   The second step was complete .   The fourth step was complete .   The second step was complete .   The second step was complete .

It was n't .   It was n't worth it . I was n't about to give it any shit . If I had a choice , I had to stay home . I did n't have the choice .   The woman in front of me was staring daggers at me , as if it were for something . She walked toward me , past me , towards me , and I knew she had to . This was it . There was a monster .   I had a chance .   But I needed to stay away from this monster . I needed to stay away from this monster . I needed to stay away from this monster .   I needed to stay away from this monster . I needed to be away from this monster . I needed to stay free .   I went to the monster . I needed to make sure the beast would do well .   I needed to stay away from this monster . I needed to stay away from this monster . This monster took me time to stay away from this monster , to be away from those monsters , to be away from our monsters .   I needed her . I needed to stay away from this monster . I needed to stay away from this monster .   I needed to stay away from this monster . I needed to stay away from this monster . This monster had to have to be scared .   I needed to stay away from this monster . Leave this monster in the afterlife . I needed to stay away from this monster . But I needed to stay away from this monster . She needed to stay away from this monster .   I needed to be safe for this monster .   I needed to stay away from this monster . I needed to be safe .

I needed to stay away from this monster .   I needed to stay away from this monster .   I needed to stay away from this monster .    
“ I don ’ t know why you ’ re here. ”   I did n't really want to believe it . I had been there for years . Many of them . Many of them used to be more than this , some of them used to be smart enough to wear things and others used to wear it . Some of them used to be smart enough to live like that . But it was so difficult to tell when you were .   I was sitting on the bench , looking at my hand . I knew there were many more options for me . We could play a game , play a game , build a game , play it . At last , I had told you to give it up . I had always wanted everything . And if you wanted to , you would have to know why .   But the game was very much bigger now . More and more important now .   I had seen this whole game before . All the games , my games , what you were saying as I read every single piece of paper I had spent in my pocket . I had told you to keep calling me by the name of your game . I knew this game was a game I 'd never wanted . I was always going to win .   Now , though , if my wife couldn ’ t find out I would have let her be in my pocket , she would pick up the paper .   So I got bored . I said , “ Good luck ” , and she threw up the paper .   I sat .   Sometimes , I would ask you the same questions and say , “ What do you mean ? ”   We found each other , in silence , and I nodded .   Instead , not the same question , but the same question .   One day , I finished .   I left . 
`` ... Mr. Timmy ! Is this right ? ''   The white Christmas sky was full of glittering , white and white paint . Mrs. Timmy was confused .   `` Oh , who am I ? ''   Mrs. Timmy blinked brightly at the white Christmas-white-haired girl in the white dress .   `` We 're all in Heaven ! '' she yelled . She looked up and down at Santa . In a matter of minutes , she was all staring at Santa . `` *Why do n't you see Santa ? * `` Well , I should . ''   Santa looked up at Santa and closed his eyes .   `` He 's dead ! We can live forever , Mr. Timmy ! ''   Mr. Timmy looked up at Santa , before turning back to his computer . He watched as flames rose from his body each time he would be able to form a shape .   `` Is this me ? '' Mrs. Timmy asked .   `` I 'm not . I believe I am . I believe I am . But you are n't the only person here . ''   `` I have already found this ... Mr. Timmy . ''   The white Christmas sky was full of glittery smoke .   Santa looked over his shoulder . At Santa 's computer , there was something strange about it .   Santa 's mouth opened . Mrs. Timmy was staring at him . He had been so confused that Santa was not seeing Santa . `` Yes , sir . I am . ''   Santa turned back to his computer and went back to his computer .
I stood up , slowly , and let out a sharp breath . A smile had gone on my face before , so cold that I could feel the wind outside my fingers . I could see that the shadow was already there , the shadows in the distance , even as the sun faded down , it was still there .   `` It 's time to leave . '' I called out . `` Come with me , I promise . You wo n't go this far . ''   I did n't want to go this far , I just wanted to have a good life and I would n't be here . I was here , and there was nothing I could ever hope to .
`` So we 'll see the faces of the stars again and again , you want the last time ? '' the first ship said .   The stars were white , and the world around them was covered with black , shining green , and white . For the entire universe , there was a man in his late 20 's with the glasses and his glasses and glasses . They were the same blue , as blue on his forehead . The blue on his forehead twitched above his neck , and his brow dropped , and he looked to the right .    `` You know ? That 's why I came here . ''    From his side , a small hand wrapped around his shoulder . The voice said , `` Look , you look like an old man . Its hard to say I do n't think that 's how they say it . Like I said , you 're really old . Or you 've always been around for so long . ''    The first ship left , and the first ship left the planet orbiting a distant planet . The ship said , `` You think that 's the last time you 've seen someone here ? ''    `` No . '' The third ship said , and the third ship left . The second ship left the planet , and three other ships left the ship to rot further away .    `` I could n't believe it . '' An older older man in the late 60 's replied , `` The only thing I can ask is that was the Earth , because I still heard `` the last time it left Earth , '' and yet again ...    The three ships left the station , and the other two ship left the station , and left the two astronauts alone .    -- -    EDIT : Added the word `` the Martian '' in his last few paragraphs , and I went about my new world , to write this next time .
I have been through this fight before . I 'm in this war for a few years .   I do n't know what to do , but I do n't know what to do . There 's absolutely no way I 'll ever save another person for death .   I have to save this town .   So I go to prison .   I take a long breath and wait .   The next thing I know is that I die , and only if I die I need one more blow .   I breathe .   I breathe again .   I breathe again and again .   I remember .   I remember .   The first time I fought , I was surprised . I 'd lost , and I still have to fight .   I still have a lot of battle .   But I need to save a million people .   I was worried .   This is what I had n't fought for .   I 've killed a thousand people , and I 've killed hundreds of thousands , and my life is nearly all mine .   Some people do n't know what to do .   I 've been through this whole fight for about 20 years , and my past life .   And then I see it .   I ca n't find a way to save this wretched land .
`` Muhhh ... yeah , '' I mumbled .   He was n't answering my question . He 'd just made my move .   I thought about what he 'd done . I 'd just have to make sure he did n't get out of his way . This was his first try .   It was amazing how easy his brain was to develop as a catalyst for his mind to become the one he 'd started talking about . And he did n't really know .   I pulled him closer . `` G-hey , dad ! '' I 'd say .   `` How do you know about my condition ? '' He 'd say there was a time we walked out of the room .   He 'd get in . `` I 've been there for awhile now . ''   He 'd just shut up . I was waiting at his place . `` Do n't worry boss , it 's a big deal . ''   `` Oh , I 'll go . ''   `` What do you mean ? I 'm just thinking we see what I 'm putting on . Just because of someone 's work. `` I said . `` Do n't worry boss , I 'll just want to get out of here this time. ``   I closed my eyes .   I pulled him to my side . He was not paying attention . This was n't his first attempt at talking , obviously . Or that I 'd planned . He also did n't want to see me at all .   I 'd always wanted to be the one where we 'd left the place , I just wanted to see what he had done .   In a hurry , he shoved the door open .   I held him tight . `` Hey , you 'll see me later if you ca n't help but understand what you 'm thinking . ''   The shock washed across me . `` Okay , let 's get out of here . '' He said . He stared at me nervously . He did n't even let go .   I looked around at him . They should have gone wrong . He was n't moving . That was n't how it worked to make sure there was n't anything happening in the world that was n't a problem .   `` You think you 're being honest with me , huh ? '' I tried to think of something . I tried . `` Look boss , I 'll just tell you about a whole lot of things all over the world . ''   There I was . I was walking to my car and finally stopped . There was no time to stop . For a moment , I felt like I had just left the place . I did what I wanted .   I stared at him . `` Maybe I 'll just tell you what you 've done . ''   The tears came back . `` You 'll do what I do , dad . ''   He was n't saying anything . It was n't just the tears that streamed down his face . I could only sob . I did n't just cry , but I was n't there .   I was n't there . I was lying . I just ... lay . I was n't there .   My heart was beating from my chest . `` What happened ? '' I screamed .   He was n't silent . After all , I was n't there . His words were soft and harsh .   The whole room was quiet and silent .   I knew that I was there . Was n't there some sort of light ? Or was there someone else behind me ? Or was there something else else that was n't there . I could feel the cool feeling of anger coming over me . It was pure emotion .   He looked at me . A piercing glare . I felt it . I knew what I had done . I could feel it . I was n't there .   Even if this was an ordinary day , I 'd find myself in a more comfortable city . It was my home .
I did n't have time to react with everything other than the noise that clack of the steel and steel and metal clacking of the wood . I looked around , trying to see if the bank was just a small town : the entire town had fallen to pieces . The men walked around the counter and looked at me with surprise .   `` You ... not even noticed me , '' I said , rolling my eyes . `` How are we going to keep those damn legs off ? ''   `` Because this is not how this happened that year , '' he said . `` I got into one of you guys , but we had about one more than enough money , so ... do you know what I really think we 're going na do ? ''   `` You mean you two are going to put us out here in this town ? ''   `` Yeah , you 're going to have to let yourself relax , '' I said . `` Just get to work , there 's a firebomb down there . I want to take your place in the back where you 're going , but do n't worry . Put my hands all the way to the back of the bank . ''   `` But we 're going to be late . '' I said .   `` You 're going to have to be late . '' He said .   `` If you 're going to take care of me , then we can get up there tomorrow , '' I said .   `` Do n't make me be late '' he said . `` We have to get in the back of the way . Not to mention that we have to be late . ''   I looked down at the floor , noticing that it was a white ceiling ... was n't it ?   `` Let 's go inside , '' he said .   `` Go ahead , '' I said . `` Go ahead , please . ''   The men looked at me with confusion .   I smiled .   `` You 're putting us away ? '' I asked .   `` I already know , they are going to be late . ''   `` Great ! '' I said . `` If they did not come up with us , then I can leave soon ! ''   `` But I need to , '' he said . `` When they did n't come up with us , I 'll see what they can do with this place . ''   `` Okay , '' I said . `` What 's going on here ? ''   `` See how we want to go . ''   `` Look ! You 're not going to miss them , '' he said . `` I 'm going to show you then . Please help ! ''   I was left alone behind the white ceiling , and I took my place in it . I wanted to see what the hell was going on , but no words asked .   `` I 'm gon na tell you something , '' he said , and I led him out into the back of the door . `` When we go out , let 's go , '' I said . `` Just , get out , go inside and pick all the guys up . ''   `` Is there any way you could say that ? ''   `` I 'm going to tell you what a real problem , '' he said .   `` I 'm gon na tell you something . ''   `` I do n't want your kind to keep them safe . ''   `` I 'm just going to tell you something , '' I said .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -      
`` No , no , no you do n't '' I said . This was n't supposed to happen , I had done this for years . After all , I had no idea where I was going , but we were here on this beach , and these two men had just finished dinner with a couple of others at the beach . They had just finished dinner after dinner .   I decided that I could get back to my place and go , and I needed help with them . I do n't want to want to be upset , but I did n't want a job , so I told them to leave this beach without going back . I was n't supposed to have to go back , I would n't be able to stay here too , and I always tried to get up .   As soon as I got back off my seat I decided to go back home to get a nap . I thought about it , and I had a plan to do .   I wanted to see what was going on , but as soon as I got home I told them to let me go . My heart was racing , and I wanted to see what was happening , but I should be in that chair . Somehow I knew the gun was n't so bad , but I had used it . I also had n't used it for so long , and I did n't even need to get to it . I did n't have much time at work . I decided to lay down , and thought to myself what had happened .   I stood up and tried to get up , but it was n't quite time . My legs , my legs , and the thought of hurting could only be broken , but my arms were n't as big as a gun . The room was dark , and there was only one window to a side . I did n't want to be here , but I did n't want to . I was n't going anywhere , and I was just going to get home .
*What are you looking for ? *   *The darkness had all gone dark once again and I could hear the other children 's prayers . The children were the only ones who could hear the words , but in my head , they were n't doing anything . `` I will do anything to bring you back to haunt us . ''   *And how would it go ? *   *The Dark Lord*   *I have n't slept yet . I could make it to the city . I will miss him . I can make it to the city . It will be beautiful . And I will miss it . I will miss it . *   *And what will it be ? *   *And how will it go ? *   *I will miss him . I will miss him . But soon you will miss him . *   *And I will miss you . But I will miss him . *   *And we will miss him . *   *And why do he love me ? *   *Because he 's the only one who can love me . But I will miss him . And I WILL miss him . *   *And I will miss the whole forest . And I will miss him . And I will miss him . *   *And that will do it . *   *And I will miss him . Those ... well ... I will miss him . There will be no more time . *   *And I will miss him . But I have lived long and long . And I will miss him . And I will miss him . *   *And I will miss him . And for the last time . And I will miss him . And I will miss him . *   *But he will miss me . I will miss him . *
`` Well , you 're an atheist , right ? ''   `` Yeah , what do you mean , not a fucking God ? ''   `` Well , that 's a god . ''   `` And you 're telling my God that this is a god ? ''  `` Well , I have to explain it to you . But do n't you have any faith here , and I know that it 's a god . I figure you 're God , right ? ''   `` Oh , it 's also a god . That in your own head is proof that this is a God . ''   `` You 're suggesting that what are you saying is true ? ''   `` I mean , I must be god , and then I need to explain it to you , right ? ''   `` I mean , that 's just sort of funny . ''   `` Well , I suppose that is just a god . ''   `` We have to explain the God . He 's telling you that 's not true . Though we have to explain the God . ''   `` I 've been saying that it 's not true . I think it 's true . ''   `` Do you know that it 's true ? ''   `` I 'm saying that it is true . ''   `` Well , but I really do n't think that 's true . ''   `` Listen , I 'm saying that it is true . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` So I think that 's true ? There is nothing about it . It is a god who is supposed to be gods . ''   `` A god whom is called God . ''   `` And a God who is one that is gods . ''   `` And why are you telling the God that ? ''   `` Because it is true . Then that you are god . ''   `` Well , that 's what you 're saying . You 're saying that it 's true . ''   `` That 's true , right ? ''   `` You 're saying that God is God . You are telling the God that God is indeed God . ''   `` You do n't know . You 're saying that God is God . I meant that god is God . And that there is no god who is God . God is God . And God is God . ''   `` But I guess it 's true . ''   `` Because God is God . ''   `` So I can tell you that God is God to be God ? ''   `` Because he is God . ''   `` Why- ''   `` Because God is God . ''   `` Because God is God . ''   `` Because God is God . ''   `` Because God is God . Because he is God right ? Because God is God . Because god is God . ''   `` Because God is God . ''   
He woke up to the sound of clinking . As he went , he realized he was panting . The sound was almost like a thud . He looked around from between the windows . There it was . He heard footsteps .   He glanced around the room and saw a single window in front of him . He looked around at the room . A hole lay beneath the bed .   `` Who are you ! '' he screamed as he looked up at the ceiling to see a tiny bed in front of him . It looked like *my* bed .   `` My God ... '' he sobbed . `` Did you come from this room ? ''   His eyes were wide . He was screaming . He was n't sure if he ever started this again . Was this just a dream ? Was this nightmare what he remembered ?   He looked up at the ceiling . Blood filled the room in a giant pool of blood . He was sobbing . `` You were crying ! ''   His head started to sob . He felt a lot of blood . One of his hands was dripping from the ceiling . He could hear it , but nothing came out .   `` Oh god ... '' he whispered as he jumped up . A small man ran towards him . He was in the middle of a large hallway , with large white doors . The room was also covered in blood . He looked back at the man again .   `` Who are you ? '' he asked .   `` You 're ... '' The man was n't supposed to have a voice . He was n't supposed to be dead . He looked around . He heard the clinking of blood .   `` I am him . '' He whispered as he stepped further into the room . The man stopped , staring at the man . He was trying to get his hands up and down .   `` I ca n't go back to sleep . '' The man said .
* '' Ohhh… ..there 's nothing out there ... '' I said my name , but my stomach was numb . The last words I remembered when I was the first survivor I saw . Apparently the cure was infected . In fact it was infected with me . We were n't sure if it meant that , it was still ... *   I looked around the room , the air was so thick and damp the air was warm and I could hear the screams . I stood up , grabbed my hunting knife and headed towards the door .   Oh shit , everything was so humid almost no one noticed . I was naked , and I heard the scream coming from the kitchen . I walked towards it , grabbing my gun in its sheath . She put it down and yelled at me . I yelled like I must have slept .   * '' Hey , hey , hey , did n't you get a bite ? Oh no , I 'm hungry . '' *   I looked up to see her face , and realized it was a zombie . I grabbed her arm and she was so sick to her face . I started wiping blood from her shirt , and she was screaming at me .   `` No , you are hungry ! Do you want to eat ? ''   * '' Yes , you are . `` *   I looked around , and noticed the zombies were starting to shuffle in from behind . When I turned they were getting closer , and after they could , they were starting to speak again .   Unexpectedly , they were just starting to go ahead .   * '' Sorry , um , I 'm sorry , you are so hungry . Thank you , I thought to myself . `` *   I saw how many people had to live on their own , they were so kind .
The broadcast was silent . Well , here we are . Everyone is waiting for the moment . It was silent . The news was dark , but the news was already on .   `` We have to prepare for the purge , sir . The city has been evacuated as your city needs a few more minutes as your city 's resident . ''   `` Thank you . Now your mayor , the city should be evacuated , but you 're sorry for the purge , the city should be destroyed , but it is n't about to end . ''   I looked at the three people sitting in front of me , their faces solemn and solemn . They had a small group of three strangers , who looked like normal people . Some people looked like little kid , but they did n't seem much different . The kid was a man of the sort , very early in his 60s , but with a sort of hardworking eyes . He had a large stomach like that , with dark brown hair and a beard like none . They were big enough for him . They were big enough for him , he was a man of the kind . It was a man of the kind of guy with a dark eyes , but also for him . He was quiet , usually reserved for himself .   `` So , are you staying in bed ? ''   `` You 're awake ? I 'm coming down here . ''   They looked for the first time since the epidemic started . They would be in the hospital at the time , but some would be fine . My wife gave me a hug , saying goodbye . I stood up and walked up the stairs , my legs slowly stretching .   `` Maybe tomorrow , maybe three days , maybe two or three ? ''   `` Nah , '' he put an arm around my side , `` We 'll just get to work . ''   I looked at him , who was sitting on the couch . The way I used to think of him , whatnot . He was pale and deep , staring at me with a smile that made his skin grow brittle .   `` Alright , good , '' he said , `` I 'll be here later in five hours . ''   I felt my body become tense . I knew it was happening . I should n't have sat up , but the weight of the events must have slipped . He had a sharp look on his face . He was trembling , looking at me as if he were breathing heavily .   I walked towards my wife , who was standing next to me . She was holding a gun to her head . It was a gun . One of the best marks she had made . `` So , a zombie ? ''   `` We went home to check our house in the morning . ''   `` Yeah , that was the first day what we did . It was a Saturday , though . It was n't a Monday , it was June , and I was just about to walk on a cold snow road . ''   `` We were about to start it , sir . From outside , we could just put on a black hood to work . And the smell of burnt flesh on the wind . ''   She looked at me with a shrug . `` So , what happened to the house ? ''   `` When you first noticed the smell , I was at home a few days ago . I noticed a few people walking around the station . Like , some were doing a shopping party , but I noticed that they were still following me , and I was n't able to tell when I saw them . ''   She had a strange look on her face , as if she was about to ask me something , but I could n't tell if she wants to say anything . I sat up and started walking . I walked it up and down the street . I quickly walked down the street , but my heart quickly cut out . The first one , and I noticed one of the first few of them . I got up , looking around once again .   `` I saw a zombie . ''   `` Did you see a zombie ? '' They were looking at me , thinking of what I was talking about .   `` The zombies were growing . They were growing up . I could n't tell where they went . I thought they saw a zombie . ''   `` A zombie ? ''   `` Someone started killing us . '' The second one said , as if that was an insane being . I looked around again , in confusion . Was this a zombie ? I thought for a few moments and looked at them , while my heart sank and I let out a scream . I stared behind me as I stared at the two of them , still staring at
Dear diary ,   It is the greatest gift I have ever bestowed upon my gift of life . I am proud to see that I have become something other than a person .

I decided to leave the room , and immediately started to drift around in a dark room . In the dark room I found myself occupied with only an audible siren . I stared at the screen , as it appeared that I was dreaming of myself , with a very curious look on my face . With a deep breath and a deep breath , I lifted the covers off the bed and began to pull a pillow out . Just before I could get to sleep , a loud bang startled me . As I woke up , I looked at the world . My best friend . My head was moving , as usual , but I could n't quite see the door . A woman with a dark hair , I thought . I looked at her confusedly , but then pulled the sheets off and looked over at my friend .   `` Who 's my name ? ''   `` I 'm you . ''   My friend ran a hand through his hair , and pulled them up . He looked at me , and went to shake me violently . He looked at me again , and asked :   `` Hello ? ''   I answered : `` I 'm me ? ''   `` Um , it 's me . ''   I saw myself staring up straight into my own eyes . It had strange eyes . What was going on ? `` I ca n't remember . I 'm me . ''   `` What do you mean ? '' I asked , his voice cracking without making a sound .   `` I can hear you , but I ca n't stop it . ''   `` You 're me . ''   I looked up at him . `` I know you 're me . But ... ''   `` How ? ''   `` I know you 're me . ''   `` You 're me , what ? If I could talk to you and I could talk to you ? ''   `` Wait , how did I know you were me until then ? ''   I looked over at the woman . She stared at me at the ceiling in all kinds of angles . Her tone matcheduated by the sound of her voice . It was n't until I caught sight of the woman who could n't hear me . `` Um , what do you mean ? ''   `` You 're me . ''   `` I 'm me . ''   `` So you 're me , here ? ''   `` No . I mean ... ''   `` So you 're me . You 're me ? ''   `` You 're me . ''   I looked at the woman again . `` Who 's me ? ''   `` I 'm you . ''   I looked up at her . `` Wait , where are you ? ''   `` I 'm you . ''   They looked at each other . I looked at the woman again , and she then looked at me . The woman was staring at me again . I looked at her sadly . `` Are you a me ? You 're me , I 'm *me* , I 'm you , I 'm me . ''   `` I 'm me . ''   I looked at the woman again , and the woman nodded sadly . The woman turned to me with a smile , and I nodded .   `` You 're me . ''   `` But I 'm you . ''
The snowstorm was a perfect storm , the ice storm was a perfect storm . It was like the sun never had before , the endless storm , the winds had been torn clean by fire , the ice and snow had begun melting , and the flames of the ice remained , and they still stuck to this earth with a single crack of ice .   It was like watching the snow , watching the ice fade . As it fell , it was like watching the world burn out , and the lights began to fade , and then I woke up . The sun was warm , and the snow was hot , and the freezing would n't have made it hurt .   But the pain still would n't hurt anymore . Maybe not .   And to that day , it happened again .   They 'd wake up early , and when the snow came back up , it would be cold .   I opened the door , and the lights to my face revealed the world .   I stopped moving , and the world was filled with cold .
A doctor could tell that he was a ghost , or maybe a ghost . It was just a myth , the true theory , a joke , or the fact that he 'd been able to live .   His death was a cruel joke . He was a ghost . He was the ghost , a ghost , a ghost . He was never a ghost , in the dark .   He had been there in his attic for 13 years .   It had been fun , and sometimes he wished someone had told him how he had been lied in the dark . One day , he 'd forgotten to tell his father to tell his stories . He would never hear them again .   There was nobody in the room . But in the dark , he had never seen anything like a ghost .   The doctor had seen what , and just told him , `` Do n't we have to be here for a little while ? ''   `` No , '' the doctor replied , `` why so ? It would happen only to a few scientists , you know , and the whole world would never be happy . ''   The doctor had always had an idea , but one of those scientists had told him of it .   `` Why is n't nobody here ? '' the doctor asked , looking at the two astronauts .   `` Because there is no one around , '' the astronaut replied , `` then what would happen if you were n't there ? ''   The astronaut took one deep breath , `` What would happen if you were here ? ''   `` No , '' the alien said , `` now , we must be here for a little while now . ''   Before he could say anything , the astronaut turned on his heel and walked out of the room .  
I was sitting in my chair , staring at my laptop . I blinked . I could n't remember blinking anymore . I did n't want to see the message but I could n't remember everything . I tried to turn my head and see if there was any indication of the source of the message but my mind was racing with questions . I waited and tried to think of what it would say so I could translate it to the same old writing style as words I had thought of it in my old brain . I stopped to stare at the message and the date was on top and the date was on the list . I thought about how the world ended , how the world ended and how it ended .   I leaned forward . Its pages were written in my grandfather 's hands and the screen of the artist 's story was on top . He was sitting on a chair and an old man with a chair across from me moved me into the chair and into the chair . He was smiling but it was the smile I usually used to imagine . I looked at the date and it was , but it was the exact same .   `` I 've seen it before . ''   The man stood up and walked away . I sat back down again , thinking of what he was going to say . I looked down at the floor and started to notice that the page was still on top of the page - with the same old written language as `` how far did you catch us ? ''   The man smiled again and stopped his pacing and his pacing and looked at me with a blank expression . I walked over to him and took a look at the screen and looked at the date . It was n't right . It was n't right . The date was on top of the page .   I could n't figure out how much it was . I looked at the date and everything had changed . I sat down and closed my eyes .   I pulled out my laptop and thought about how much I wanted to go back and do it again . I placed my feet on the desk and started to read .   *This book has the ability to communicate with you . You know what I 'm thinking . *   I took a look back and then shook my head . The date had one in it , if that meant I could at least tell the difference .
At first , the universe was completely normal . The stars were everywhere , they were black , and then everything went black . When a few planets started to expand , a single star had finally started to turn dark once , and there there was nothing to be done .   When the planets started to expand , they started growing bigger and smaller . They had no idea how they had experienced the universe they had been hiding . At first , they believed it had originated from in huge amounts of space . It was incredible . When a few galaxies started to form , a massive black hole was revealed .   A couple hours later , it was discovered that something was n't there . The aliens were scientists and scientists . And then they started expanding . Suddenly , the black hole enveloped the entire universe .   Soon , the aliens had started to grow bigger . Their own universe began to grow more and more smaller as one . Eventually , it became bigger and bigger and greater . Finally , as its entire universe grew smaller and bigger , it became bigger and larger every time .   Eventually , it began to grow bigger as they were growing larger , growing larger . Eventually , it became larger , larger and larger . It started growing larger with larger size . Then , all the stars started to grow smaller and smaller . And then , all the planets started growing bigger and smaller .   Then , things started growing smaller , bigger . Soon , the universe was growing bigger . The stars started growing smaller .   Soon , a new universe began to grow larger .   The first day , one year , a new universe started to grow bigger , bigger and bigger until this time , it became bigger . And growing bigger , smaller , bigger , bigger , bigger . It started to grow bigger and bigger , eventually . And bigger , bigger , smaller and bigger . Soon , it formed bigger , larger , bigger . And bigger , bigger and larger .   Then , the entire universe started expanding . The bigger , bigger and bigger , bigger and bigger . Soon , it became bigger and bigger and larger . Then , brighter .

The house was a cozy affair . The sound of a door being shut was comforting . A small wooden room was a small , large room . Despite the noise of the door , there was just a single window in the corner , and the only sound was our living room and a door . A simple , wooden stool slid open , and I nearly dropped it .   `` We see . '' He began to say , his features not as dark as the night he had been left alone . `` You have been sentenced to death by the owner of the lamp . ''   `` Not just a name , '' I countered , `` but a name so that never gets used to it . I 'm not the type of person who has been sentenced to death by the owner of the lamp , but of course you have the privilege to grant someone . ''   `` Are you afraid of something ... '' He was not lying . His voice was harsh and rough , as though he was not coming to terms with the situation .   `` I do n't know why I signed this letter , '' I replied , still angry . He was trying to find out where the door was .   `` I want a nice life , '' he started to say , `` you 're not afraid '' .   `` No , '' I answered .   `` Very well , '' he responded , `` that is when you chose to make a wish for yourself '' . I put the arm around my legs . My body was stiff and weak , and I felt a pain all over my face .   `` No , '' my body refused . `` I want one . ''   `` No , '' the voice repeated , `` but you must understand , you must understand what I am doing . If you wanted one , your wife would be able to be able to be able to tell you how her voice was made , and how she had made a wish , and how her voice made it seem . ''   I was certain my brain was n't moving , and I stared at the person 's body waiting for him . He was looking right to me .   `` Your wife would be . She would be lying down at her desk . ''   I had my mouth dry and I knew that I was n't hurting , but I did n't want to . My eyes were in shock , and I knew that I was n't hurting .   `` Fine , '' he said , though in a way I was n't feeling quite good for killing , `` but she did n't want anyone who did it . I wanted the same . Inanimate objects . ''   He responded , `` So many so often inanimate objects . ''   `` Is it possible I 'm a person who does n't want to be able to live without a living without a living without a living without a living without a living without a living without a living without being able to suffer without being able to live without living without a living without any living without living without a living without even living without living without a living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without having a living without living without breathing alone without knowing someone should find their living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living with being able to stay without living without living without living without living without living for what the living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living without living .

The woman looked at me with disgust .   `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I have a bad idea . ''   `` I just wanted to let go . ''   `` Why my parents even called you out to do what you are . ''   `` If a single person , it would just be a little easier like you could do . ''   `` Why would you do that to me ? ''   `` I do n't understand . People are trying to help . Maybe I can help you . Or maybe I can help you . ''   `` I do n't understand . ''   `` What did I do ? I do n't know . The government needs to understand ! ''   `` Do n't deny it . And you can help me . ''   `` Now , if I do n't , I can help you . ''   `` You 're getting a lot more important . ''   `` No , you 're not . ''   `` I 'm afraid . And you 're getting good of yourself . ''   `` You 'd go to the police and call me cops , where 's my daughter ? ''   `` But it 's not the police and I do n't want you to protect me . ''   `` I do n't do that . ''   `` I do n't understand . The police are putting me to the police so I can help you understand . ''   `` But I do n't understand . I do n't understand . I do not understand . ''   `` So you 'll do that to me ? ''   `` No . ''   `` But I am . ''   `` But it 's not the cops . And I do n't understand . ''
I ’ ve done this too many times , my friend . I ’ d met him earlier , my first girlfriend , and I ’ d met him in the middle of a park on the roof , and I ’ d met him . I 'd met him when I was young , which is when he came back . The first night was when he saw me . The first night I moved towards him , my girlfriend . I had been staying as happy as possible and it helped me to stay awake . The second day was when I was lying in the snow . I didn ’ t care either , I saw some snow falling out of nowhere and they ’ d been out for two hours until last night .   I looked over my shoulder and I realized I ’ d been crying for two days . I ’ d met him in the park for a few days , and I was too big for him to say anything . I still couldn ’ t believe that he was on the outside . I never believed anyone . So when he saw me , I remembered him . He was so… nervous . When I met him , I told him everything he could to tell him to come back , that is when I met him , that part of him was worried about me . I didn ’ t expect him to reply , or to him that would be my last reply , which would be a good question . If he knew , it was him .   I was certain that the snow was falling all the way to the ground , as if he had . I didn ’ t want him to return to his place , and that he had been here more often than he could . He didn ’ t want me to go back , so I could spend my time in his place . I was scared of what he should say , he wanted me to do the same . I didn ’ t want him to say anything , but he was so weak . And he was so helpless . I didn ’ t want him to live .   I stopped when I touched him , and he was so frail . He looked at me and gave me a smile . He nodded slowly , and I smiled at him . He kissed me , and I loved him . And he smiled , and we kissed . And he didn ’ t want to see him back , but it was then that I realized that I wanted him to give me more time .   I told him to go back to my place , on the roof and on the roof , and he laughed . He gave me a kiss and said , thanks . I told him that I ’ d come to him sometime when I first met him . If he did , he would cry , because that ’ s what I wanted . And I gave him a kiss , and he smiled , and I went back to the roof .   I told him that I was glad we had the same conversation . I told him that I ’ d meet him again , and that he would ’ ve had a meeting . But he told me that I should stay awake longer , and that his memory was of him . He ’ d said that I was him with the same experience , and that he ’ d finally see me again . I told him how , and I told him that I was happy .   And that it had happened again . They were both laughing , and that ’ s when he broke my arm and said that I was happy . And that ’ s when I saw him again . 
I ran over to the window and gently pushed the door open . The trees were barely moving , not so fast as I had expected . I could hear the familiar sound of the leaves being ripped into a small hole . I could n't see it . I could n't see anything but the faint sound of a dog barking . I had heard that voice , and that 's when I heard it . I slowly scanned the window , trying to determine what it was in . It was n't big enough for someone to believe it was that something had been different .   I kept running , my hand reaching toward my waist . `` What are you doing ? '' I cried out . The thing in front of me was that I was getting closer .   I was still running , no pain . This was n't big enough for me .   I had been running for years now , I did n't know what to say . I had heard that voice . It was n't big enough for me , just a bunch of rumbled rocks against the floor and around my neck . I tried to run , but I could n't . I tried to run , but I could n't keep moving . I realized why I was walking . I could n't go . I tried to run , but I could n't move . I tried to run , but there was n't much left .   I eventually reached the edge of the room and I dove . I caught a large piece of junk in the wall and found a small bag placed in a box . It was n't long before the bag started spinning . I did n't want to run . I ran . I ran . I ran .   There was no way I could be stopped . I frantically ran , but my feet hit the floor .   I could n't run . I could n't run .   I ran .   I ran .   I ran .   I jumped .   I saw it .   I scrambled .   I ran .   I could n't run . I could n't .   I ran .   I ran .   I ran .   I ran .   I ran . I ran .   I ran .   I ran .   I ran . I ran again . I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran .   I ran .   I was .   I ran .   I ran .   I ran .
For what seemed like a hundred years , I thought that these people ’ s faces were a bright new color . There were tears of those big glasses of water dripping all over my face , and my mind was racing . Some of the crowd could ’ t help but notice . The last thing I saw was my body and , of course , my own eyes were burning so he could hear the crowd calling for me to come back . I found myself looking up at the sky . There was nothing in there . Oh well , I didn ’ t want to see the sky .   The crowd was still there , all of my friends , and I knew I was dead . I heard a shout and a scream and everyone had collapsed . They were dead and they were dead . I didn ’ t know what to think of , so I grabbed my gun . I pointed it at the man standing next to me .   “ Hey ! Hey ! ” I shouted and yelled . “ Hey ! What do you want ? You can ’ t go get your own hands on your shirt . You can ’ t. ” With that , outstretched hand , the crowd laughed and laughed . A wave of relief washed over me as I walked towards the man . I looked down at the ground . As we moved closer , my eyes began to take shape . The crowd was still there , staring out at the buildings in the distance . They were now staring intensely . They did not notice me .   “ Listen . I don ’ t know why I ’ m here ! I didn ’ t want to see this man anymore ! ” The man pointed to me now . “ You can ’ t see me anymore . Look. ”   “ Do you know why I ’ m here ? ” I asked .   The man pointed to me . “ Please ! I didn ’ t want to see this man anywhere ! I just wanted to see him ! ” He paused , his eyes glaze over .   “ Please don ’ t ! I don ’ t want to see you again. ” I said .   “ Stop , listen ! Please ! Just don ’ t ! Do not be stupid ! Just do not let me out ! ” He said . He looked angry .   “ No ! I want to see this man before you die . What now ? ”   The man looked down at the tears in his eyes . “ What now ? No , no . I ’ ll go to the city now . Every day I ’ ve loved him . Sometimes I do that . Sometimes I love him ! It ’ s not that I want to see you again ! I already have the courage to leave you . Why now ? I want to understand . I want to see him again . I want to see him again. ”   “ Your fucking , listen . I know not what to say . Please ! Please ! ” He said .   I looked up at the sky . I saw it at the sky , and the sky .
A man with a knife with a knife with the knife in his hand held an arm as if to break it .   Sighing , he quickly turned to face the knife . Suddenly he realized the knife was just there , there was only a slight dent in it , and the blood on his shoulder was bleeding from the wound .   The man raised the knife in his hand and spoke again with a stern voice that sounded like the world was ending .   `` Honey , it 's okay boys . '' The man said with a full smile and put down the knife into his hand .   `` The pain is going to be your daughter 's fault . '' He said before putting his hand back in his hand .   Sighing , he brought the knife in his hand and squeezed it tightly .   `` I 'm sorry mom . I just do n't want you to hurt me . I know it . '' The man said as he started to walk .   Sighing , he turned and put his hand in his pocket . He opened his fingers for the knife , wondering what it was . He did n't know why he was holding it , but he did n't know .   He lifted the knife and placed it in the table .   A man with a knife in his hand made a big noise at the man 's hand . Biding his time , he turned and faced the man with his knife . The knife closed in on his hand , and a small black hole slowly disappeared in the man 's hand .
`` Now , just let me take this old man 's little speech from you . ''   `` Tell me , why do you want to hear it ? If you want you to hear it , just let me know . ''   `` Does n't matter , '' I replied , as I shuffled my way through the crowd .   `` Look man , I 'm just here to kill you . You are here to kill me . You are here to make me do a job on earth . ''   Fucking asshole .   `` Sorry , mate . What 's your name ? ''   `` Oort . ''   `` I 've been here for many years since I was younger . ''   `` I am here to discuss my options . I 've been here for many years . ''   `` You do n't have the money for me , I do n't want to be this easy to kill you . ''   `` I 'm here to kill you . ''   `` I am here to kill you at the end of a long run , but this is a good time . This is my new job . ''   `` And I 'm here to kill you . ''   `` But ... ''   `` So what ? ''   `` Every single one of the movies shows someone more nervous than you . ''   `` Do n't . See , what 's the secret ? There are two people who you already have . One of them who has n't even seen yet . You are here to collect them . How many years did you know about your life in that game ? ''   He was n't expecting me to make an angry motion . `` Your age is over , so when your life plays out , you go to your friends , and at that time , you know that your life involves you being the best man in the world . ''   `` Why are you here to kill me ? ''   `` The greatest man in the world ? ''   `` For some reason , I have no regrets , so my life does n't break , so I die here to kill you . There is no pain , no fear , no anger . I 'm here to kill you . ''   `` So , why would you leave ? ''   `` I want you to make me feel better . My life is over , but it is n't worth it . My legacy is over , so I take back all of my lives , so the rest of my life is over , and we 're here to learn why I 'm here to kill you . ''   `` But you could n't win this old man . ''   `` It 's here . ''   `` What are you doing next ? I 've done a lot of things to deserve ! ''   `` I 'm here to kill you . You can get away from me once the year is over . If I did n't kill you then you 'll be here to kill me . ''   `` My life is over , buddy . ''   `` That sounds great . ''   Before I could react , he saw me standing there . I reached out to grab him by the collar , and he grabbed me by the collar , and pulled me off . I hugged him tightly , but he began to sob .   `` I 'm here to kill you , mate . '' I said . `` Do n't worry , you ca n't get away from me . ''   `` Then how far would you give me ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` A game of chess does n't matter that you 're here to kill me . ''   He took him off .   `` You 're here to kill me all . I 've killed you and left for you . ''   `` If I do kill you , the stakes will pay for it . If you did . Thank you for protecting me . ''   `` Thank you for your help , friend . I can see you in the rearview mirror , with a clear blue eyes . ''   `` So , what 's the purpose of the game ? ''   `` Nothing . ''   `` You see , no one else is here . I 'm here to kill you . ''   `` I 'm here to kill you . I have killed you before , but before you go into your living room ,
One day , the first boy moved out from his perch , a happy woman who was sitting on a bench with a loving , happy woman . She was playing with her husband and a perfect children . It was not the life , of course . He gave her a little laugh and let her play along . She did not like anyone else . She did not like anyone else . She like anyone else , not that anyone would ever ask . She did not like anybody else . All of them . The man who lived alone , did not like people who lived alone . The boy who lived alone , did not like anybody else to care . The man who lived alone . He only wanted to stay in solitude , not with anyone else . Every night he came home , while the wind began to blow , and the trees began to dry like weeds . It was not the day he would be here . It was that the boy was not alone .   Each time the man moved out from his perch , the old woman 's parents would be there . They would often take care of each other , get the scars she would have for them . They would take care of each other , leave themselves , for their little lives . It would not matter now that the boy in charge of her work would be here . The boy who lived alone , was there . No one could know . The man who lived alone , that too was the death that would come from him . The man that lived alone , had spoken to the man who lived alone . The man who lived alone , who lived alone .   The man who lived alone , who lived alone , seemed to have been alone for so long . They lived alone , though their parents had been afraid to see him .   The man who lived alone , with no other friends . They lived alone , and they had no doubt that someone who lived alone would end up alone . They lived alone , alone . Each day they lived alone .   Only the man in charge of his work would ever answer . They lived alone , and they would not need something to ask . It was not the boy who lived alone . One day , their small lives would come to life , each day they would come to life . They would come home and find the man who lived alone . The man who lived alone . The man who lived alone .   The man who lived alone , had lived alone .
The scene was brutal . A woman was already dead in a second . She was n't so much alive . The man inside stood before him , his long and slender beard billowing all over her pale face . She looked up at him and felt him with eyes wide as he struggled to regain his composure .   The man smiled smugly . `` I 'm sorry , but I did n't think you 'd get a treat . '' He looked up at her , his dark eyes , and told her they 'd let her know what it was . `` Where 'd you find your clothes ? ''   The man nodded . `` Any last time . Same ? '' The woman nodded sadly . `` I find my clothes . I do n't know why I even wear them . ''   The man nodded again . `` A pair of jeans ? That 's what I 'd wear . ''   The man nodded .   It was a good idea at first . He turned around to say `` Heh . That 's what I 've got to do . Heh . Heh . ''   The woman chuckled again . `` I know everything . '' She turned to her husband and grinned . `` Heh . Heh . Heh . Everyone else has a name . Someone who is quite happy . ''   The man was silent , but he always did . She reached in her hand and wrapped it around his chest . `` This one is dead . ''   The man nodded nervously , before the woman could even answer . `` If you wanted to see someone else like that , who could I have been ? ''   `` I 'm going to take this one , '' The woman let out a yelp . `` They 're very well suited . My name is Mary . '' The woman shook her head . `` And what 's this you are doing ? ''   The woman was dead now . The man shook his head . `` You 've done a great job for me . We get to meet again . ''   The woman walked off . It was a long journey to get out .   As the woman exited the house , the man did . He was in the living room . A few hours later , the man had gone on to work .   `` Is that my job ? ''   The man stood , confused . `` Well , I guess I 've been building up the courage to walk this whole time . ''   The man chuckled again . `` This one was the first thing we 've done to tell the other , I guess . What can I do for your ? ''   The woman nodded enthusiastically . `` You 've been building up the courage of this day . What 's this ? ! ''   The woman frowned . `` Why would I do such a thing for your life ? ''   The woman nodded . `` Is that the word ? ''   The woman shook her head . `` Yes . ''   The man chuckled again . `` Perhaps you should . '' He glanced at her . `` Not to worry . ''   `` Or maybe I should n't . I have seen the beautiful woman . ''   The woman shook her head with her hands as the man grabbed her shoulder . `` We 're doing a good job . You do n't have to . I do n't want the women at all . ''   The man smiled again . `` Then why would I do such a thing ? Why would someone be so happy to lose ? ''   The woman nodded . `` Well . I 'm a good leader . I 'm afraid I can tell what , but I do n't want that much . I do n't want that . You 've been building up the courage for a while now . But I do n't want that . You 're not an evil man . ''   The woman shook her head sadly . `` Do n't worry , I 've lost my life . ''   The man felt his eyes stingy . `` I do n't want that . I want to be happy . I want that . You 're beautiful . You 're happy . '' He let out an exasperated sob . `` Why would you do such such a thing for me ? ''   The woman 's smile widened . `` Because I 'm only going to have that on my own . ''   The woman stared at him longingly . `` I think I 'm a bad man . But I do n't need a gun . ''   The man felt his eyes close . `` I have no
I walked into the bar at 7:00 PM , the cold sweat dripping profusely down my forehead . I do n't know what I 've touched , but I 'm not sure what it 's like to be alive . One minute or two seconds ?   I turned my head and saw my twin 's body , the man who had a baby 's head and three eyes , and the girl who had been wearing a pink dress underneath . My twin just smiled . He had a weird smile .   `` Wh-What 's wrong ? '' I asked , to my younger self , in a surprisingly sweet English way .   `` What happened ? '' he asked , somewhat incredulous .   `` You did n't notice . I was dreaming . '' I replied , and I knew what was coming .   `` Well no , I do n't know . I just went in to sleep . ''   My brother was talking about his life as he was about to say , `` Well I do n't know who you are , but since you 're being reborn I did n't need to do some research . ''   My twin took a deep breath , `` You had to stay alive and you did n't have any plans to find out . ''   `` My brother and I are a clone , but I 'm not sure how to handle the situation . I 'm not sure if I have any plans . ''   `` I do n't think you 're going to be there , '' I said , with a somewhat disappointed sigh .   `` I do n't think you 're gon na be there this time , okay ? If you do n't believe me I do n't know where I am . The answer is , '' he said , gesturing about his own body . `` You should only assume that you do n't understand my own mind when I die . ''   It was me ! I had n't really thought my twin would actually be there . We 'd either meet , or that , or we 'd meet . I 'd have to wait for it .   `` Alright , I 'll change tomorrow . Come with me . ''   `` Tomorrow ? '' He asked , and I gave him a firm hug . They passed the bar and I stepped back , out of the corner of my eye . It was me , of course , so my twin was wearing an eyepiece , and the smile that made everyone go with them .   `` He 'll be there soon . I 'll be there tomorrow . '' I said , and I walked back to my car , heading back to my apartment .   ***   I checked my house , the door unlocked , and the house in the corner would go completely empty . I walked back to my house and sat down . She was wearing a white dress , and I could see it in the distance .   *No way* I thought .   I stood up , hands raised . My sister was n't happy , and I took a deep breath . I had never felt a day before I walked into my apartment after that .   The door opened and I saw myself in a mirror . My twin was standing right beside me , but I did n't recognize him . His clothes were tattered , and I knew what it was .   I recognized him and he walked to the mirror . I took a step back and saw my twin . He looked for me .   `` Where ? '' I asked to him , and I frowned , making eye contact .   `` This time , I 'm going to need you . '' He said , making eye contact . `` Is there something wrong here you can do ? ''   I nodded , and he looked at the mirror closely .   `` Is there something wrong with your head ? '' I asked , puzzled , and then shrugged as he talked to the other me .   ***   I closed my eyes and took another step back . I felt the hands on my shoulders , and saw myself staring at the mirror in a dark blue eyes . He laughed .   `` And what did you do ? '' he asked , and I smiled at him , and he smiled .   `` I 'm going to need you to look for something , '' I said . `` What 's going on here ? ''   He looked at me .   `` I 'm going to need you to look for something I say , but I wo n't put it in your head if you do n't want to know what
He stood outside the door with no armor or armor to support his armor . As soon as he entered the castle , he looked over his shoulder to see his son on the ground . It was a boy , he had no army , and were a tad scared when he walked past the castle .   He felt a hand brush through his hair . It was already past his shoulder , and he knew what was going on . He was n't sure if the boy was the hero .   The boy looked down at his hands , and looked at the boy .   `` You 've chosen me for the day , sir . I 've saved your lives , and I do n't care how hard I am for it . I do n't worry about you . ''   A voice .   A young dragon .   A man .   `` No ? I 've killed your father before ! ''   A tear streaks down his cheek .   `` No ... I ca n't . I 'm simply ... ... ... .I ca n't ... . No ... .. ''   A boy .   A few hands .   `` It 's been too long ... I miss you .

It would be a rather simple day to find out about the dark side of the Milky Way .   For weeks I had found out about it , the two worlds . Nothing different , and nothing new .   After the third planet of the Milky Way , I found it . The entire galaxy , surrounded by nothing more and as one of the planets , scattered across this planet .   The planets were not yet the same , and as the planets on the Milky Way , it must have meant the same . This was something , but strangely enough , the fact that they had not seen the planet in centuries could have been the same .   I found myself watching the planets from the distance . I found a new planet , and once again I found a new planet .   I searched the stars for new planets . I found someone who could find something .   I found another planet . They had destroyed all of their ships , and their ships were full of them !   All we found was for one , a planet that could have been found in it . I hope to find a place , enough for an answer .
*He ran out the door and ran into the living room . *   He had always known his home would be more than he knew . The old man had always known he would be there . His old mane , his work mates , all he 'd seen were his friends , his brother , his father , and his family . The house looked at him in amazement , his father , his brother , this one as they called it . *   He walked over to the chair that had been placed in the middle of the room , reading a `` video game '' on the wall . It was a dirty piece of paper and was a tiny piece . The title of the video 's play 's name was read in `` I 'm sorry , I feel so sorry . '' It did n't say anything , he just smiled at his mother .   He brushed it off , and read it aloud . `` You 've been following the rules since 'I do n't have a job . ' For years I 've been following the rules . ''   He sat down , and picked up the paper and read his message . *   *He ran to the living room , there was an envelope on the desk . After waiting for it to be opened , he picked it up and got ready for the living room . A man with a cold , cold , pale face , and his brother .   *We need to get out of here . It 's just you , * he thought .   A few more moments passed as the man searched for the envelope . He had spent years chasing it , enjoying it . But there was something in his mind .   *I should n't have been here , * he thought .   The man looked at the paper and saw the other man . There was no use . *   *You 've been following a rules to rules for years . You 've earned some happiness . *   He let out a sigh . `` I ... I ... I 'm sorry . It 's the only way I can get out of here all those years . ''   He took a deep breath , and closed the door behind him . He opened it , and looked outside . The sun peered through the trees . It was covered by clouds , and the old man knew the way home would be when he asked what he needed , a man with big eyes and big dark red eyes , just like all his life .   *You 've lost this . * He thought . He looked outside . It was sunny outside , light even still . He had n't seen a man since there was a person in the house .   He let go of it and smiled , and the man was so pale . He knew what it was the first time he 'd seen it , so bright . He closed his eyes and let go of the man , but was not listening for the man 's mother 's voice .   *You 've lost this , * he thought . *I have n't lost it yet . *   *It does n't matter who you are . * He thought . *Of course . I know what your purpose is . * He put out his chair and wiped his tears off his face . *You killed one of my friends . *   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -      
The sound of their footsteps clacking against walls sounded a little too loud , and the familiar texture of their footsteps were unlike anything in the universe . The sound of their boots clacking against the damp pavement caught their attention , like an insect running through the air . The small crowd of people that had lost their ears were buzzing and they knew they could hear them talking to them in a manner that sounded almost like a thousand tongues .   `` Wait ! '' the leader shouted from the ground , his voice a harsh and harsh but loud yet menacing voice .   `` Please , sir , please hurry . '' he replied , his hand raising to his jaw . The crowd was silent now , and the voice sounded like they were arguing .   The crowd was quiet again , and a person was sitting on a floor facing a glass window . The group was starting to figure out *What an odd occurrence* , the leader said .   Suddenly , a door opened and a man appeared to have a large , brown man holding a clipboard . He put it back in his hands and began to walk towards it . The man saw his partner in the middle of the room , he realized he was in his early 20 's . His arms were covered in dirt on a small table . He waved his arms to his partner as he walked quickly over to him .   `` Is it your turn to say ? '' the man asked .   `` Yes , I do , sir . I am very pleased to inform you that my partner would be here to investigate the situation . '' The man replied .   `` Sorry , sir . '' The man said , his eyes darting around the small table to confirm the situation .   `` So . He 's still very aware of who he was , which he 's got at this point . '' The man said .   `` What happened ? '' the man stated .   The man looked up at the man and nodded .   `` The most recent report of the same species of the same species when they were a little different . Are we to leave behind that ? ''   The man smiled weakly . `` My friend , we 're leaving behind , '' the man said .   `` Do we have an answer ? '' the man asked .   `` Yes , sir . '' The man said .   `` Yes , sir . '' The man said .   The man grabbed the clipboard and started walking towards the room . The man looked around at the table with a mixture of confusion and confusion . The man saw he was going to have to walk away .   The man ran to the door and knocked , and he fell into nothingness , until he landed on the floor next to the man . Before he could react , the man looked and gasped as it came out of his hands . The man reached down and dropped the papers in the air , dropping them from surprise and horror . His arms shook as a man ran away , then ran away , screaming and sobbing , then screaming again .  `` Is he okay ? '' the man asked . The man stared at the man and said after a long pause , his eyes darting around the room .   The door closed slowly , and then he left .   `` Are you okay ? '' The man asked . His partner smiled . He was still crying . They had tried to escape .   The man fell onto the floor and the man took all the furniture .   The man stopped in his tracks and threw out his arms and said , `` That is it . It started as a child .   When the father looked directly at him , the man said , `` Well , yes . This is it . ''   The man ran down the stairs and down the stairs the stairs to the front of the room . The room was dark and silent .   The man called out , `` Hello , there ! The door is very quiet . '' He yelled , and reached down and grabbed the man 's coat .   When the father walked away , the father looked at the door and said , `` As you can imagine , I have an answer . I am not sure what to say . I , this is going against all odds . I , we have been watching this happen . And now we can see the problem . And what does it matter ? '' the old man asked . The young man started walking away , the tears running down his face . 
# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap )   In my dream , I was greeted by a bar tender , scotch , and a drink of ale that offered no pleasure . I put the bill away , but I knew not what the man needed , so I did after a while . A small , but elegant looking man , with a bright , shimmering glow and a smile that almost looked like he was not listening from a man in a corner .   `` I think I ’ m going to end this , ” I said , “ But you are not interested in the establishment . It ’ s not like there might be a way to get around you. ”   I chuckled , and then went to grab a beer . He handed me a quick drink , and I pulled my way out of the bar to the bar , and handed him a small bottle . He smiled , and my smile widened . He did not acknowledge my question , or even flinted from his glasses . I grabbed the bottle and lifted the glass , and poured it both in .   `` You are going to wake up , ” he said , the bar tender lifting a drink .   I took another drink out from my pocket , and began to pour . The man nodded , and then reached into his hand and pulled out a small , worn photograph . He spoke .   “ I am going to end this , ” I said , and I turned and walked out the door . I stayed inside , looking down and the dark night in the night were the same . I had wandered in the streets , and I felt alone .   I noticed that the man didn ’ t seem the same , so I walked down the street , and grabbed a nearby glass . I closed them , and began to drink .   Once again , I had felt the warmness of the night air , and I stood up . Inside the small table , the man was leaning against his desk with his hand clenched on the table , as his arm connected and he let out a deep sigh .   I took a long drag , and took a few deep breaths , and I opened my mouth . This man had the same time , and I had had yet to find out what he saw . He leaned over me , and slowly sat down next to me , letting out a shaky breath . I took the small sip , and drank it quickly .   I took the small , warm liquid from my hand . What did he mean ? Did he know my name ? I leaned back and looked .   He took another deep breath , and he inhaled . “ You aren ’ t here to wake up , ” he said softly , and began to say with a nod , “ you are not here to begin this conversation. ”   “ But I am going to end it , ” I said , so slowly that I couldn ’ t help but stare at him , and he said , “ But you ’ re going to end this conversation , and it ’ s all about you. ” 
I woke up next to my mother and my mom . This was my first day of high school . The smell of mold had filled my nose in the house . I gave birth to myself . My sister raised me . My mother stared at me with a wide smile and shook her head . Her eyebrows twitched together in surprise before she returned and smiled at me . I smiled , not realizing what could have happened . I was not a monster of me . My mom got up and walked out of the house . I was surprised to see my mother standing there . She was just staring at me , waiting for me . I smiled and thanked her and closed my eyes . The doorbell rang , I did n't know if my mother would die . As I made my way to the door , I saw myself , a reflection of myself . My face and I recognized the name . A woman with a brown hair . A short blonde hair .   `` Welcome to the meeting , '' the woman said with a small smile . I smiled , smiling . `` We 've been waiting all night . '' She had said with a little smile . I took her hand . `` Who are you ? ''   I told her that she was a bit older . Her hair was old and I could tell it was a blue . Her hair was blue . She was almost perfect . And her face was a bit of a smile . I had a lot of excitement in the world .   `` The one who survived to kill himself ? '' I asked . `` I am not your sister . '' I said to her .

It was n't one of those days I would have thought that this would be the perfect day . It was a day in the office ... Just another of mine . But just another day .   I was a man , and even though I did n't think it would be a day ...   The first day of battle had gone to hell with Dwight . He and Dwight left our lives . Dwight , Dwight , and Dwight , like me , left us with his wife and wife . Dwight and Dwight , had been together for weeks , and finally had gotten together . Dwight and Dwight had been together for the past few weeks , starting to get together and then being together for a while , I went to the office to explore which each of us would reside here . But , Dwight and Dwight knew that there was no real way we could live without a single goal of life that could , nothing had ever taken and we were both in the same situation as the night we spent .   Dwight and Dwight looked at each other happily , and I heard the first waves of `` the sea has already been . '' And then it was gone . I knew that someone , or something , would end badly ; Dwight and Dwight would live happily ever after .   Dwight did n't want to be alone ( but that 's what he asked me ) . We were , in the same place , in the same place where the sea had grown so vast that the sea had become too vast that the sea had felt like a sea . But it was soon gone . I had no idea what I am seeing , nor at all . A wave of terror surged through me , overwhelming me . I did n't care .   I had won as a man , I had won as a man , and every day I saw Dwight and Dwight are gone . I still see Dwight , and the sea has grown so vast that I can not continue to live without Dwight , but as the sea has become too vast that the sea is where they will go . I would still be here , and I would hope they would remain with me .   Dwight was one of me .
I 'm a man of evil , and I am what they want in the city of the Superheroous , but this is good . They have n't been . They do n't want to know what he 's done . But it 's not even that he 's done it ...   There are some ways to stop any one by one . Some of their biggest villains were destroyed in the chaos of the city . They had escaped , and they had been doing so for decades . And now I 'm living a good life . The best I can do is give a big speech and laugh .   They 're wrong , but I 'm sure that they 're wrong . The villains are wrong . They get trapped and imprisoned , but they do n't want to . They just want to see me .   I can see the scars on their faces . They 're all wrong . They did n't want to die , but I did . They wanted to realize what was going on ...   One that 's the only way out . There 's a knock on the door . I do n't know if it 's their fault , but they 'll be here . If they do n't want to be murdered . Or if they do n't do it for the world to be the only way out does n't matter anymore .   The door opens , and nobody enters . Some people are crying , others are crying , but they do n't seem to get out . They seem to know who I am . They 're crying , and they 're already crying .   I 'm so sorry . I have to stop them . I 've tried to protect them . But I 'm so sorry . I 'll leave them . I 'll leave them . I 'll leave them . Please .  
`` I do n't think I 'm ever going to ever talk to someone who can just leave me alone ''    The music had gotten over with me suddenly , so I went on about my day . It had all been a quiet day , and I had not heard the music yet . Finally , the song ended just as I could hear it clearly . Even after the music started to fade , I felt bad for it , but I did n't know it . It was as though everything was already making a happy birthday for this fact .   I walked through the halls of the building and opened the door . The music was amazing , but the most important part of the music was , the very same thing every day , except for a dull dull ache , the bright rays of light making a bright light on the windows of an apartment complex . Even the light was gone , so I took a deep breath .   `` If you 're hearing people coming home , why are the people coming home ? ''   The music stopped . No more music . The music started playing , but it was there . The light went out , and I found myself smiling . The light was just a fading white , but I could see my face .   `` I just wanted to tell you all about my life , and I want to call someone else '' I said . I could hear the music slowly beginning to disappear . I felt bad for myself , I could feel the light becoming brighter , and I wanted to tell everyone what happened .   `` I love you so much , I love you so much , but I always love you ''    I ran forward , and the light faded . It was like the music was passing out after a few months of quiet .   `` You 're doing not even know your true love is what you 're doing '' as I walked to my door , and I opened it quickly , as if I had just been walking along .   ____________________________________________________________    As I walked up to another elevator , people started to wonder what had happened . Everything was so wrong .   ____________________________________________________________    Suddenly , I sat up and looked at my clock . I woke up , it was still starting to show up . The light was still off , and I felt nothing . No more music . I felt myself rising as I pressed buttons . As a child , I felt something . A feeling of sadness . My heart skipped a beat , and I felt like I was being watched . I felt my heart rate slowing , making me feel my legs were going to be fast .   ___________________________________________________________    I walked back to my room , and when I woke up , I felt something . I was in a room , and I was holding my head .   I looked around , and saw something . I opened the door to see someone .   `` Hello ? '' my mom asked , bewildered .   `` No ... just ... '' The voice was my mom 's hand . `` No , just ... there 's something bothering me about your life '' I looked at the person in front of me , and saw something inside . I saw something , something . I could see it , and something was moving on at the same time . It was something , something ... nothing . It was n't there . It was there . I felt the same feeling , and I felt it . It was warm , it was ... warm .   ___________________________________________________________    As I woke up , again , I remembered . I could see it , and it was real . I looked in the mirror , at the face of my mother and my mother . I saw the realization of what was happening . My mother , standing on the toilet , screaming for help . They were holding their hands , and I could feel the power coming home . I felt something around me . I felt something . Something . Something ... ... . Something . Something . Just . Confusion . I opened my eyes , and the light was gone .   I saw the man in the mirror , and the man in the mirror . I stared at his face . It was weird . He was just like me , like me . There appeared to be something . Something ... ... . I looked at the man in the mirror . It was just as if he was talking to me . He was just like me , wearing a lab coat . He looked like me , and spoke .   `` Hello ? Mr. Roberts , what do you need to know that I have a problem '' I said , opening my eyes .   `` So you 're here ? I do n't
I stepped out of the house , ignoring the man in white dress and tie . The man in black was laughing at me .   `` Hey , hey , do n't be rude , just a little joke and a little bit of surprise . You 've finished your show , '' I replied , smirking . He was n't laughing at me . Either way , I was holding my hand . `` Now you 're back , I have a special guest on my hand . ''   He shook his head . `` I 'm here to see you for this , '' I said .   `` Oh , I 'm glad you 're there ! '' He said , his tone growing more serious . `` You ca n't be wrong ! You 've made you a magician ! ''   I looked up . `` You 've no magic . I 'm just talking to ghosts ! Let me show you again ! ''   His brow furrowed . I made a very aggressive sound . Instead , I got up and started to walk in .   `` Oh , so you 're not going to be here ? ''   The man in white stood with a smile . `` What has that happened to me ? ''   I looked up from his cards . The man in white dress and tie let out a small puff of laughter . He grabbed my hand and took it again . `` Well , as I said , he 'll keep himself alive . ''   I took a moment to smile , and walked past him .   Inside was a large room . It seemed to be a small table , but if it had a table , it was even a little over 4 chairs , the table , and the table . The same table that I had just entered , a man in white dressing stepped forward . He took a look at me and nodded , his eyes widening .   `` Here we go , '' I said , grabbing a small bottle from behind my glasses .   `` I have a really bad idea ! '' he told me . I tried to ask him what it was about , but his voice was too high . He nodded again . He handed me a small pill .   `` Well , '' I said , looking at it again . He gave a quick nod . `` Then , I 'll show you again ! ''   He stared at me , shocked . Then , I started to see him look up at me . I looked up toward him and said , `` What is this ? ''   He nodded and moved to the room .   `` Oh , that 's right . Do n't be that ... ''   I looked at him . He cleared his throat and said , `` You are supposed to have fun with this magician , and I 'll show you this , ok ? ''   He looked down at me and sighed . `` Thank you , Mr. O. O. O. O. O. O , very pleased . ''   I looked at the table again . `` I think it 's okay , '' I said , rubbing my forehead . `` *If I would you like your show , right ? * ''   He said , `` Here we go ! ''   `` Alright , '' I said , handing him a small bottle . He waved excitedly .   I stared at him for a while , but then looked at him again . `` It 's not fine , '' I said , walking back inside the room . He handed me a box , then handed me a small pill . He handed me a small glass of liquid , then handed it to me .   I flipped the bottle open and found a small card . It was there . I turned to him and said , `` What 's it , sir ? ''   I looked at the card and said , `` It 's nice to see you again , but I 'm here to see you again , '' I said , putting my hand down to the table . `` Is it okay ? ''   `` Absolutely not , '' he said , putting it on the table . I put my finger to the side and said , `` I 'm sorry I gave you the card , sir . ''   He closed the lid and slowly , he opened his arms . `` I 'll show you the card , '' he said , leaning against the table . `` Well , if you want a card , then you 'll be back . ''   I looked at him puzzled . `` Oh , so you 'll be back later tomorrow . ''   I walked quietly to the table . I saw him smiling . I reached
I wonder if this is an interesting idea for a story . Have n't been done so far , but here you go , and there is a lot that can be done . I like to think that this is some kind of sci-fi crap you can be reading . I do n't really want to see their own story , and I 'm not sure how I could write anything they have ever written , because any of them have even read on their own , but I know better .   **1 : We 're starting to build a new world to each other , but they wo n't . They 're getting scared of people , and some of us wo n't understand . They 're angry at all , and it makes it difficult to think of anything , but they 're upset at the thought of them . They 're afraid because they 're scared of people they want to get their guns on , and they are so terrified that they 're scared of what they 're imagining and what they 're imagining . I do n't want to be in this world , but I choose not to be scared .   **1 : We 're getting ahead of each other . Neither of us are scared of people . Some of us are starting to cry , and they ca n't understand . They 're scared of people , and neither of them are scared of people . They 're scared of people .   **2 : We 're getting ahead of you . Do n't be scared of people . We 're scared and scared of people . We 're scared of people we 're scared of , and we 're scared of them !   **2 : We 're scared and scared of people . We 're scared of people . So we 're scared of people who do n't really care for us . We 're scared of people , and so we continue . We do n't want to be scared of people , and they 're scared of people who do n't care for us . They 're scared of people who do n't care for us , and because they 're afraid of people who do n't care because they did n't care . Hell , I ca n't even let people think of anything anymore . I do n't want to be scared of people who do n't care . I do n't want to hurt people because I want to scream .

`` Now , sir , '' I said tentatively . `` What does people want to do with me ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' said the officer .   `` Well , I 'm going to kill you , '' he replied .   I nodded , a smile slowly creeping across his face . He was a little sad , like most others .   `` I have my hand . I 'm going to kill you , sir , '' I said , standing up and wrapping my hand around his neck .   He took a second to process what he was saying , and his attention made me a bit uneasy .   `` Are you sure you were alright ? '' I asked slowly , putting my finger on his tongue .   He took another step back and looked to me . He looked at me like he had said something .   `` The rules are simple , '' I said . `` Are you sure I am joking ? ''   He shrugged . `` I do n't care is all I can do when you are in no condition . ''   I frowned . `` Do n't worry , I have my hand . I 'll go . ''   He said , and walked to the door .   I stepped inside and closed it behind him .   I stepped inside and watched them turn into a small room . I had been planning on killing them for a year now . I then realized they could stop me .   When they did , I heard the door rattling behind them .   I slowly stepped inside .   They held the gun in place , and then I shouted , `` you have one . ''   They opened the door .   I was shocked . I froze in fear .   `` It 's ... '' I whispered .   The door swung open . I threw my hand away .   Again , they opened the door and I froze .   I was surrounded by cops .   `` You are dead ? '' I whispered . `` You are not going to kill me . ''   I looked into their eyes . They knew I was joking . I had never seen them before at least , and the rest of the gang had a couple of hours before .   The police were looking at me , looking up at me . `` What 's going on ? ''   I looked at him , and then around .   `` This is going to be a long day , '' I said , `` a good week ! ''   They led me down the hall .   I was going to kill him , let alone the men . I should have just killed him , to prevent someone else stealing a car for my life , but I had to kill him .   I had to wait .   I walked out the door . The guard followed me down the hall .   I approached him . I then grabbed my hand and shoved him back into the shadows .   `` Go out- '' I started . There was no hesitation behind me .   They finally opened an already lit room with the highest ceiling fan .   `` Do n't worry , '' I whispered , and started walking . I stood up , smiling into his arms , and took his hand .   `` Good evening , '' I said . `` We 've been preparing for the execution for this week . We 've been preparing for this day for years now . ''   The guard looked at me , and said , `` Good morning , Captain . I 'm going to have to take that back . ''   I walked to the window , opened it .   `` I know , '' he said , and in began walking towards me . I walked over to him .   I said , `` Now , '' I said . I did n't want to die without him .   I walked back outside and entered the room .   They got into the room and headed to the kitchen .   `` Are you feeling alright ? How do you know ? '' I asked .   The guards grabbed my hand . `` I 'm just going to kill you . ''   I felt like I was dying .   They went on to kill me .
`` You are saying the NASA Colony is sending you to the surface by landing , sir . ''   `` My name is Major Ziplock , there is a second delay to leave . ''   The man on the other end told me the story of the Earth . I was n't just an astronaut , the Russians were so excited . The first human to arrive at FTL was a regular man , but the first human to arrive was a man in the suit with a scar across his cheek . He looked strangely human as he had died of cold radiation .   `` Yes , sir . You have come to the surface by landing . You have come to Mars and your ship has come . '' He said , `` And you have come to Mars . ''   I was just imagining what he was saying . He was n't wearing his suit , but his suit was a plain leather tie and his hat . Maybe he was in trouble .   `` You are telling me that you should return . '' He said . `` However , I am that man who has come to Earth . ''   `` What do you require ? '' I asked . He was staring at me with an expression on his face .   `` The Space Company has come to Mars and I have come here today to find you . ''   `` I 'll be there . Do n't worry . '' He told me .   I walked out of the room to find him sitting at his desk , surrounded by a small rock , with a few white dots in his right hand . I sat down in the chair , and listened . Then a booming voice filled my mind . `` Please help . I wo n't . ''   `` I wo n't . ''   My heart became racing . My heart became racing . I was n't worried , but I knew I was n't going to get the life of some kind anyways . But the men and women who had come next looked the same in the same way . Why would anyone want to go in ? Why would n't I be alone ? I could n't let myself leave .   `` I have come to my rescue ship . I 'm your home . ''   `` Yes , that will be me . ''   `` Thank you . ''   I paused and looked at my hand . Then another voice came again . `` My ship is n't supposed to stay here . ''   I stood up and walked over to the computer , opened up the microphone . As I read it , I felt a cold breeze come from my mouth . The voice was a little familiar , but unmistakable . `` Welcome . ''
`` What 's your name ? '' I ask .   `` No dad , no dad . He had a phone call , he got a phone call , and just one of those things , he got a message . ''   `` Not it . ''   I 'm the one who remembers when he died . The one who saved me . The one who saved me .   `` I know . '' He says , I 'm one of those things who 've got upvotes .   I guess it 's why I 'm stuck here . But today , I 'm new . Life is n't going to be a normal life . Life has a strange life , right ?   I have a date . I 'm new . I 'm glad I met up with the boss . One of those things gets together , and I 'm so happy I 've had a date . For all those years I have , I can choose it . I 've been born .   I ca n't choose a date . I do n't choose a date . I 'm sad . I 've seen most of those things happen . I want to fix them . I want to fix them . I want to fix them .   Maybe I can go back .   I have a date . I want to fix the relationship . Hopefully , I hope .   I know .   I might be happy .
I watched the world be turned black . I watched the surface collapse in the pitch black . The waves began to drift around below us . We just had to be ... the same .   I knew there was a massive creature . But I had the fear that the sharks would break in on top of the ocean and I could n't help but laugh even as I watched the creature climb further up into the depths and around us .   I looked outside and saw the oceans are moving towards us .   I watched as it fell to the floor and started to float toward the water . Inwards the beach rose to a large pool , and I watched the creatures fly towards us .  ***   I watched the creatures move towards us . They were looking away , but I could see the monster crawling towards us on the surface .   `` Where am I ? '' I asked .  ***   `` You ! '' My assistant yelled . `` Please run ! ''  ***   I watched the creature walk back in the water , but then it stopped moving . I watched the creature fall to the floor . I watched as the creature descended from it .  ***   I watched helplessly as the creature went towards us , but the creature stopped moving .  ***   I watched the creature emerge from the water . I watched it fall to the floor .  ***   I watched the creature fall to the floor . For what seemed like eternity the creature did n't budge .  ***   The creatures ' eyes grew larger as the creature collapsed to the ground . The beast had just begun to cry . It looked up at me . It blinked its eyes and died out .  ***   I watched in horror as it plummeted to the ground .  ***   I watched the creatures fly in fear .  ***   I watched in horror as the creature moved closer . I watched as the creature lifted from the ground and fell to the ground . It screamed as it did .  ***   I watched as it fell to the floor and fell to the floor .   I watched as it moved closer . I watched as it started to move to the ground , and it kept moving . When the creature did n't move , I watched as it did . It ran towards us as the creatures began to retreat into their holes . It fell , and continued to lift the object .  ***   I watched as it moved closer . It was advancing towards us , and then towards us . We stopped moving . I watched as it descended , but then it moved towards us . I watched as it bent over the other beings .  ***   I watched as they collapsed to the floor . A black creature was spreading towards us as if it was n't in the water . It moved closer . I watched as it moved toward us .  ***   I watched as it raised its head . I watched the creature fall to the ground , too . The creature started to move closer . We stopped moving , and the creature was still moving .  ***   I watched as it moved from the other creatures . It moved closer , then toward us . It moved closer , quickly , and closer towards us . But neither side went around . Then it stopped moving . It left its back and left . I watched it move closer . I watched as it moved closer , but it did n't move . I watched as it moved closer .   ***   I watched as it moved closer and closer to moving . I watched the creature fall and fall to the ground . It did n't move until it fell to the side and fell to the ground .   It moved slowly to the water as it moved closer . But it stopped moving . It moved closer until it moved closer . The creature seemed to move closer . It stopped moving .  ***   I watched as it watched the creature slowly move toward us . The creature move closer . I watched as the creature moved closer , to see what had moved to the other creature . It jumped . I watched as it tried to move .   When the creature moved closer , it made no move . It moved closer . I watched as it moved closer towards us , but its tail hung up and left . I watched as it disappeared behind us . Then it stopped moving .   I watched the creature move closer , and turned toward me . I watched as it moved closer . I watched as it moved closer , but stopped moving .  ***   After a few moments of walking , it moved closer than our first time .  ***  
 And now it does n't seem like any other day , and a lot of people are probably dead . Well , my mother was there . If she was n't dead , I would have walked out of the house and put my family right out of there .   It does n't seem like I 'm in this chamber . I do n't even remember my name or any . When I woke up , no , I was on a cold corpse . Except for a footnotes where the body has been buried , some of the dead had been buried .   `` So this is no longer a coffin ? '' I ask him . He 's already dead , and he 's dead .   `` No , it 's as if you were a coffin . '' He said .   `` I 'm not sure . '' I said , tears rolling down my cheeks .   We were both dead .   `` I have n't lost anything . '' He says , `` It 's ... so ... so ... so ... lifeless . ''   I smile , my eyes are now open , and my eyes are closed now . There is a small , scratchy-looking corpse on the slab . I 'm standing there . I look up , looking down at the corpse around me .   `` I 'm not dead . ''
I always thought that my mother was the one of those things that makes her life a better place , to be a better place for a better place to go . I never thought that my father would be .   Or so I thought .   *And you gave it . *   You tell me that I 'd been there for so long . I made sure that I needed to live , that the world would n't be there all their time , that I would be there for it . The only decision I ever had was that I got a chance to live . It 's kind of fun that I did n't have to live , so I could n't find a better place .   I could n't find a happier place after all , that I had n't lived for twenty years , alone , I did n't mean to spend my nights in a hotel . I could n't find my family again .   I did n't quite think that I would have lived for an exhausting life , that I never had much time to pay .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  And that 's all that 's left . 
`` Just a moment , '' was all I could say . I heard the boy 's voice over the low noise of the alarm . Of course , it was a question I had never experienced . As I laid my arms on the bed . Once I had finished my dream , I put my hands on the covers and looked at my hands on the carpet . I was so scared .   I had always wanted to do this , but I feared it . I would always end up walking around them .   `` Stop ! '' the boy shouted . He had so many questions about her before . I could n't tell if he even knew where she had been . I glanced at my hands and smiled . I was so tired . I would never be able to forget how bad I had made the wrong mistake .   There was only one problem . I heard the boy 's voice . That was probably a good idea .   `` Yeah , '' I said . I had done what I had done . `` I could n't have stopped it . '' I could n't tell if it was his voice . But this time , he was afraid of me . It was something I had never heard before . But the boy had the very same thing about his . Every other thing I would tell him , however , was that I could n't really remember how much I had become . Which was wrong .   `` Is this why I do *not* remember when I should remember to tell you about that ? '' I asked .   `` I do not remember anything . '' The boy had the same thing about his voice . That was the point . To be honest I had gone through this many years ago .   `` What about the time ? '' I asked . Not that it mattered already . The boy was waiting for his answer .   `` I am the one to explain this last thing . When I was ten , I tried to do what I had done to my wife . You will remember her as I do . I will remember her as she was before she was twenty . That is not what you have done to her . '' The boy was silent now . It was true that he had always been a strange monster . But even though it was true .   But the boy did n't . This time , he was not . That was the reason I loved his voice . I should have kept thinking . I should have kept thinking . But it was true that I was the one to realize how wrong he was , the one to change his mind .   `` Well , I do n't remember anything . I had a dream I had at birth . I 'd had a dream when I was twenty . But this morning , I was gone by a dream . A real nightmare . I remember the beginning of the revolution . We were planning to sacrifice the society and kill the next generation . Their lives are ending in a single way . ''   I was tempted to say that before I could say my words , I could only turn in that dream . At that moment , I could feel his blood boil on my hands . I could feel my forehead tremble . I hated the feeling of it . And I hated the feeling of it . And I did n't know .   That was my first mistake . I had always wanted to get rid of the memory that felt like years ago . But I did n't want to feel the same feeling all the time . It was so perfect . But I wanted to do it again . I wanted to try . I wanted to do it again . But I was more happy . I wanted to do it again . After all , I wanted to do it again . I wanted to be different . I wanted to be different again . And I wanted to , happy .   `` I can do things things again . I can do things together and I can do things together . I can make things together . And it 's too difficult . '' He was crying now . `` I can do things together . ''   I did n't know my name . But I was so stupid that I wanted to make an mistake of it .   `` The last thing you know is that I will win my name . '' I could n't believe it . I did n't know it . I had wanted to go to my office to get a copy and head to my desk . It did n't matter since I was twenty , there were hundreds of times I wanted to do it again . But I was n't going to do things I could do . I wanted to make something special . So I planned to make the perfect mistake . Maybe I 'd get to make the perfect mistake . Maybe the perfect mistake had fallen to my desk , maybe . Maybe I 'd let
`` Alright then . Are you serious ? '' I hear as the voice disappears into the darkness , but I do n't want to move .   The room is dark and cold in a moment . I 'm so sick I 'm so sick I can see the darkness . It 's dark in the night , it is dark and dark as night . I feel the warmth of the night 's sun setting , but I know the darkness is darker than the walls . What is this , I remember I ... oh god , is this new ? What is this feeling ? `` No , no , please ... '' I hear myself say , in one last time .   I remember my father , I remember his mother . He was my oldest daughter , I remember the day he was born , I remember her first , he was just a child of seven years , he was born from fifteen , I remember him telling me he loved her mom and I loved him so much ! I think it is too late , but the pain I feel is far enough away , but I do n't know how long it 's been since I wake up . And so I stand again , the light is fading and I can not help it . Where am I ? I open my eyes and I see my father , I can see his face , and it is my father 's hair . I can see what his eyes are and I see it and I see it . Is this his body ?   I take a deep breath and say , `` No , no , I 'm just a little scared but ... My eyes are dead . Mom is alive . I want to know what is happening and why I want to know what is happening , maybe then I want to know my mommy and daddy and I can be okay . ''   He and I both know what is happening and I can feel my heart beating faster than the waves of my eyes . I can feel the warmth of my dad 's face , my heart beating faster . I run and I jump out of bed and think of the sound of my father calling out to me , `` Dad . Is this your brother ? ''   I see my mother and I must be a couple hundred yards away , but I 'm just scared and scared . I look down and the noise is so loud that I can hear my mother crying so loud that I can n't hear my mother . I hear my father yelling at the room , and when I look up the lights go off , I can hear my father crying again , but I can not see him . It has gone from here this day . I can hear my mother crying . I can hear my mother scream through the darkness , and my mother is crying . In my hand , I see my mother crying , I can see my mother crying again , but I still can not feel my emotions . My father says to me , `` Do you ever know what is happening ? The darkness is fading away , I can see your mother crying again . ''   My father stands up and says , `` I know you knew this as soon as possible , but what is happening ... You know that you could be lying to me . This only made your choice . You know that when you were born , you will always be a child of five years , and this is your destiny . ''   I can feel my heart beating faster , I must understand my father 's words ... You know that I did the right thing . My mother 's voice is broken and I could hear my father sobbing at the top of my lungs , `` It was just me ... mommy . We ... .. We were there for a while ... '' She seems confused .   Now you wo n't hear me again , and I can smell my father 's face . I do n't know how long I 've been able to hide my fear of my entire life , but I soon understand that everything was okay .
The sun is setting today , and the sun has disappeared , leaving the eastward in an echo of the morning song . The first time the sun is setting I 've listened to the song , but it 's not the song , but the song .   We were the first ones to speak in our native language ; they spoke of the song , and we learned of the song and of the love we had . They were the only ones to speak of ; they were the ones being told for what they needed to mean .   Their expressions were etched with hate but their mouths were dry and they had a tongue which could not make up their tongue . They had a tongue so they could not taste it , but they had a mouth . Yet they could not taste it .   They were going to meet me , and that was when I kissed them . I did not think the song would be spoken on in front of me , but the song was not how it felt . It was the song I 'd set in my head , but I did not think I would have the words for myself . But I did not think I would have the words .   I did not believe in my intentions . I did not want to believe in my own stupidity , and it was a good metaphor to the song that I wanted to say without emotion . I did not want to believe in my actions , and I needed to believe in my actions , then I should have .   The song was a quiet way up that was n't the song , but the song was not , and is not the song of of their eyes .   The last time they spoke , it sounded like a song was spoken on a radio ; but it was not a song too simple , and the song that came from inside inside was not one to listen to . Because the song was still a song . The musician was not enough to know the song , it was just a song that spoke on a radio that had heard . The song was melody of the song that came from inside the speakers when we were silent .   They did not understand by what the song was doing , but they had not understood .   The song was one with a smile , one with a smile that might be genuine for both their hearts and their hearts and hearts .   I had been watching my two sisters , and they had seen my face . Together , that was my last confession .   I did not . They did not understand . They were not even friends , and they did not understand . I did not wish to believe in my actions . That was what it was to know ; that it would be as if we were not friends .   They 're both dead now , and they are dead now , and they are alive .   I am alone now , and I hope that I have not told them .  
I awoke up , and the pain was gone . I turned around , and suddenly I realized that I had gone to sleep all over again . The pain had become worse , and I 'd changed , but I could n't move my legs .   `` Who are you ? Who are you ? '' I shouted as I looked around the hospital .   I got up from the hospital , and walked downstairs to find a small black scar with a ring on it . The scar was in a different one . It felt like a scar was going through a hundred and ninety times , but I decided about it for a few minutes , and I might as well go to sleep , but I was n't tired .   --   *Ding*   I went to the hospital , and found myself sitting in a hospital chair , with two people sitting on a bed , and with one hand on one of them . They were tall and had a tattoo on them . The number was 'good ' . I closed the window , and turned around .   --   I rubbed my eyes and realized I had n't slept , and woke again . My arms were bleeding , and I was looking at the scar . My chest was bleeding in a bad way .   *Ding*   I stopped , and I saw it . It was hard to remember , and I did n't know why , but I did remember that there was no pain anymore .   I walked outside , and found a lot of people sitting on my bed with their hands on the top of their head . They all looked exactly like those people , they looked like they spoke for the first time in months , but they did n't know what they wanted .   `` Yeah , a lot of people who do n't get many years and years and years spent doing the same things a lot of time . ''   They could n't understand what I was telling them . They had always been so selfish , they had to admit it better than they were . They had to know that no one had ever done anything to me with anything to deserve my power .  So I placed the first hand on a table , and he placed the last hand on his own , and he motioned towards the clock .   --   *Ding*   The nurse placed the first hand on the table . She was holding a small , broken arm that was missing behind .   `` What are you doing ? ''   `` Just talking , and nothing to say . The pain is too bad . But I 'm going to tell you something . Just look at it , and just look at it . And then , I 'm going to tell you something . * ''   `` I like you , but you know what I 'm doing ? I 'm going to tell you something , or something . ''   `` Your hand is gone , the pain has gone . ''   `` You know what I do ? ''   `` And you know what I do ? ''   `` I do n't want to worry . So I 'm going to tell you something . ''   A few more minutes passed . The nurse left the room , and I sat back . I did n't have a hand on my own , though .   --   *Ding*   *Ding*   *Ding*   *Ding*   *Ding*   *Ding*
It was n't until I heard the sound of the small gunshot . The sound of soft , steady breathing . I heard the gunshot coming from other side of the room .   As the door to the room opened , I saw that the door was empty , a single man who had kept on walking and screaming . I 'd tried everything I could to be alright , I 'd failed .   I heard the door slam open . My knees were heavy . I felt a searing pain in my body . It was so overwhelming . I tried to turn around , but the light was gone . I heard the door open . I looked over at the man . The head was a handsome man .   The voice said , `` You know we are doing the same . I ca n't . I ca n't . I know . I do n't know . But I know . I 've lost you . I trust you . I have to find you . You are going to tell me you are going to kill me again . You are going to kill me again . '' I heard the bullet through the door .   He laughed .   `` You know that . We were going to get you killed . I do n't know . I just could n't . I do n't know . It 's not too bad . I almost do n't know . I know . But I know you are going to kill me even now . You know that . I know that . I want you to know . So I 'm going to kill me again . You know that after I stop fighting you , you will understand . I do n't know how long your life will be okay . I will miss you . Please know that . You will live . I know that I know that . '' He took a long , deep breath , and his eyes closed .   I opened them . They gave me a brief look . The mask glinted as if it were an empty shell .   `` Is this all you do ? '' I asked . I had to . I did .   `` I do n't know . I know . I know that . I know that . I know that . I know it . I know that . I know that . I know that . I know that . I know that . I know that . I know . I know that . I know that . I know that . I know that . I know . I know that . I know . I know that . I know it . I know . But that do n't matter now . I know that . It 's going to take me ten minutes to kill you again . It wo n't be long . '' I told him . He grabbed my hand .   I looked back at him . He walked back into the room . He stood next to me . He smiled .   He pulled the mask off , and he pointed me towards the door .   `` Do n't , I know that . You will realize . And you will love me . I know that . And I will . I know . . I know . I know that . ''   He stepped back and walked towards me . He pulled out his gun .   We both stood up .   `` I will . I know . I know . Look at you . I know that . I know that . And I know that . I know that . I know that . I know . But I know that . Because I know . I know that . I know that . I know . I knew that . I know that . But I know that . I know that . I know that . I know that . ''   He walked back left . He left . He left , alone . Why was he here ? He walked back into the room . I think he was in there . I know that .   He walked back to the door . He slowly walked to the door . He opened it and looked through the mask . He looked at me and then back at me .   He pulled out the mask and pushed it to his face . He was completely covered in blood . He looked at me as if he was trying to get him to stop . He looked at me with shock .   I looked at him .   `` You 'll stop dead . I know that . You know that . '' He said .   I looked at him again .   He smiled .   He walked back to the door .   I walked back into the room . 
`` What are you fighting him , Father ? '' I ask .   `` I 'm sorry , my brother . I can not let you talk . It is not your fault . You were n't like the one you was listening to . ''   `` I-I mean that you could n't tell me what he 's just saying . If you 're saying anything , then why do you ? ''   `` I 'm afraid . I must ... I am afraid . I 'm afraid I 'm afraid I am not listening to you . You do n't understand . I do n't understand . I 'm afraid I do n't understand . I will give you a gift . I will not let you talk to me . I will not let you talk . I will never let you talk to me . I wo n't let you speak to me . I promise I will let you talk to me again . This time I will change anything now . Do n't let me talk to me anymore . You will not hear me understand . I will not let you speak to me . ''   The boy is in a thick Russian accent but I 'm not listening to him . I 'm not listening . I 'm not listening .   I 'm speaking , I can hear , it 's not my voice . I 'm not listening . I do n't know what I want . I 'm talking , I am speaking . I do n't know what I want but I know , what I do know . I do n't understand . I do not understand , I ca n't understand . I ca n't let you talk to me . I ca n't let you talk to the guy , he is speaking to me . I am talking . If I were to get stuck with him , I can help . Goodbye . I wish I could share with you .
Cancer and the doctor had been working the hard way to the office on Monday . Every morning , a group of doctors had said they should start discussing the potential problems and the anxiety that plagued the office . Most of the doctors were trying to make up their problems . The doctors were looking more and more annoyed than usual . The doctors were n't so surprised though , and they were n't much like that . A few of the doctors were so angry , and the doctor was n't too worried .   As he scanned the room , he understood that there was no issue . The nurses were too worried to mess with the problems , but there had to be something to say .   He examined the room , carefully trying to understand why it had n't been over . He checked every every corner of the room , hoping the doctor would be able to find a solution next week .   From him , he noticed a large , white man . He looked toward the man , who was so pale .   `` You must look into his eyes . '' He said in a hoarse tone . `` He 'll see you . ''   The doctor opened his mouth to say , but in a small voice , he was so dry .   `` What the hell ? What ? '' The nurse asked , holding out a hand , `` You have a gun . ''   The doctor turned to look at the man who stood there , still holding the gun . `` I 'm not looking at you . ''   `` What ? '' The man said in a gruff voice , `` You 're saying that you 're being serious , you 're saying that you 're saying that you are n't serious , it 's that you are saying that you were serious . ''   The doctor looked at the man . `` You 're telling me that you are not serious , but we are saying that you are saying that you have a gun . ''   The doctor began to cry , but the words came out of nowhere . One of the nurses , then , came out of the room .   The man smiled . `` I do n't think we are saying that you have a gun . ''   `` That 's right , you 're saying that you can do that . ''   The doctor looked at the man , who stood there in silence for a second , then at the man .   `` Alright , what is going on ? '' The doctors asked , `` I 'm going to ask you about this one . ''   `` Oh , well . I 'm writing this for some reason . Can I tell you something ? '' The doctor asked .   The man turned his head sideways , but was met by a brief silence . `` Everything is going smoothly . The problem is , it 's gon na get easier . And it 's gon na get easier . ''   The man took a moment to think , `` Do you know how the odds are ? It 's gon na get easier if you want a gun . ''   The man looked at the man . `` There 's a really good question . ''   `` What ? ''   `` If I can tell you something , then I 'm gon na try something . I 'm gon na try something . ''   The man nodded , and the man started to slowly walk away . The man could hear a slight gasp , and then at a minute , the man vanished .
`` I know . I never wanted to get on the board , but I wish I could show it to them . Not to mention that . ''   The players had been dead for over a century of searching for answers . Each time they were here they were standing there amongst the crowds . Each time the outcome was to come to a close approximation of their own accord . This was n't a game of chess , it was it ? As the outcome began making its way down the well known paths , the players were standing at a ready , ready for battle .   It had been a long time since they had first come together , and they talked about the last game . Now , she was n't one for jokes , and they were here to go , one for the final time . No , the best friend . But , it was the first time they were on the board .   It had become so bizarre . They were supposed to be the oldest .   `` So of course you are here to play chess , please do n't you understand ? ! ''   The pieces slid off the board with the other hand . You walked towards the game , in a long , clean white line . Soon , the two sat behind each other , watching each and every one of them . Their faces were focused on their chess , and the world was now ready .   `` Wait , what ? ''   `` Alright , thanks . My game is far from mine . I want to win , and I want to do something before we lose . ''   The rest of them sighed ; the last two sat there . One came after one of them . The other did n't watch the chess from across the board .   `` So you have another move , then ? I want to know . I 'm just going to make a move . ''   The players stared at each other 's imaginary friends . They closed their eyes .   `` What happened ? ''   `` Just a random move . I move from behind . ''   The other two looked at each other and the bishops moved in unison . They looked at each other , and the outcome was still sitting .   `` Well , I guess . What happened ? ''   `` The first move . ''   The players looked at each other and spoke , only to hear the same ones .   `` You have another move , or you will be going to win something . It will happen , but if you have to , you will get used to it and you will have to stay together . I can take over that . ''   The other players looked at each other , and saw an opportunity .   `` Look , you want to know the outcome . I want to know you better than you . I want to know what happens tomorrow . ''   Silence .   `` Alright , ok . ''
The sky was just as beautiful as the sun , and the sunset was bright again . A cool breeze blew through the trees , forcing down the trees trees as it rose in the distance . There was so much joy in the world . Yet here was nothing left . Slowly at first , but then slowly at first , but then again louder , the grass became a little more vibrant now . There was nothing there . As the atmosphere formed , the horizon became brighter . But eventually , the sun , the sky , saw something beyond the horizon , a small , sad looking flower hovering over a flower -- and then inside , a flower , a flower . Then , here it was , a small flower , all over the earth . It was all at once . It was a beautiful flower . It was beautiful , and there was so much joy in it . It was wonderful , and beautiful . It was beautiful . It was beautiful , and so beautiful . And so , so bright and so beautiful . It was beautiful , or so beautiful , and so beautiful . And then , it happened . And so . So beautiful .

The war had raged , but the forces had won .   We were all about to die , and the war had led , and we had only ever killed the soldiers . And so we fought , and they stood to me and stood and demanded the answer . At first , the soldiers seemed hesitant . Not sure how long we stood , but we were sure to see them as best we could , but we knew it would be a long time before the war went on .   And when we fought , we would run as fast as we could , and there would be more to see what we had done . And so we fought , and we fought , and those were far too far to see what we had done .   We were the only people left . They looked upon us , and then upon their faces and said , “ We are the only things we have accomplished. ” That was correct . But now they held the same pose for the rest of us to show others what they had done . And they were proud to not know what they had done , and they were proud to be taken as the enemy we had done , and that was what they had done : just for the sake of death .   And so we fought , and we fought and fought , and we fought harder than we could comprehend , and we fought , and we fought . We won , and we won . And so we fought , and the battle wore on . And so we fought and fought , and we fought and fought . And we fought . And so we fought harder than we could comprehend . And so we fought , and we fought , and we fought . And so we fought again , and again , and through our final battle , and again .   And so we fought , and we fought , and we fought , and we fought , and fought , and we fought , and we fought , and fought , and fought . And each day we fought , and they fought , and we fought , and our glory began . And so we fought , and fought , and they fought , and we fought , until we fought . And so we fought . And so we fought , and yet we fought , and we fought , and it fought , and so we fought , and we fought , and we fought , and we fought until we fought , and we fought . And we fought , because we fought , and we fought , and we fought . And we fought , and when we fought , and we fought , and we fought , and in our last battle , we fought. ”   And so we fought , and so we fought , and we fought ... and we fought , and , and it fought , and we fought , and we fought . And so we fought , and we fought , and we fought , and we fought , and we fought , and they fought again , but we won . And we fought again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again again , so our warrior fought again , and again , and again , and we fought again , and again , and again . And again , we fought , and again , and again , and again , we fought again , and again , and again , and again . And , we fought , and at so we fought , and again , and again , and again , in silence . And so , so we fought . And so many wounds , and we fought , and we fought . And so we fought again , and again again , and again . And again . And again , And again , and again , and again , and again . And I fought again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again . And again , and again , until I fought again , and again , and again . And again . And again and again , and again . And again , and again , and again , and again . And again , and again , and again , and again . And again , and again , and again , and again , and again .

# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap )   In the years of my life , I grew up in the shadow of the snow . I used to hide under the snow as a kid , or hide under the snow if you were trying to hide under the snow and hide under the snow . Through a lot of snow , I used to hide under the snow as a kid . And then , while I ran from an animal-like shelter , I did n't want to do anything very exciting . I did n't want to risk being a child that would be my choice but I thought it was luck . It was only an attempt . If I were to protect a child , then why would it be my choice ? I 'd be able to fly , so I could n't risk having to risk losing my mother . I 'd been able to hide under the snow for a while , if only I could stay under the snow . That 's the only way to protect my mother , the only way to protect a child was to protect a child . My parents died just as they got older by the time I got older at the time .   That 's why I broke up with my family . Because they still do n't notice me as they get older . Because they 're still taking shelter because they get younger , so I 'm not afraid , and they 're still still keeping me alive . If I were to protect a child , then why would I want to protect a parents of the people I did n't know ?   I 'd been caught in a long time . That 's a bad time for them to see me . For now , just as much as I had to hide behind myself , and maybe even worse , I was n't afraid of that . I am scared . For now , it 's easy to see my parents grow up , to protect my parents and protect both of them . I keep running , and I can still see my parents grow older and younger , and I see my own eyes dart from side to side . If not , I 'd have to protect them . For now , if only I could protect a person .
The first letter , The third letter . I told myself , `` it 's not one of those . '' One of them said . It was the last letter that I took to get it .   I did it , I *can't* do it .   It was a year after the letter . I had heard that word for weeks , and had n't done anything to scare me . To do it .   I 'd started to read it again , and again , sometimes I would make myself happy . I 'd tried to help myself in the new book , but I had not done anything much better , so I stayed in a state of panic , at the same time .   I figured my heart would be hurt , I began to panic .   I tried to make myself happy , to make that word for myself . I could n't risk making myself sad , I could make yourself happy . I was n't the only one who saw me , and I had n't done anything to help .   I tried to make myself happy . I 'd tried to make that word for myself .   I figured I 'd just make a whole lot better . I 'd get done my laundry tonight , and I 'd finish my laundry now , and I 've tried to make myself happy .   But then , the second letter , a letter , in the back , was gone .   I started thinking about the word on the note , which was already gone . I needed to reach out to grab my hands when the handwriting became too real .   I began to understand what could have happened . I could n't say anything to someone else , what could the date be , what could have happened now ? I opened my hands and quickly began speaking to someone . Maybe there was a moment before the letter left , or maybe there was something wrong with me .   I closed my eyes , and slowly began to make sure they were indeed my hands were not mine .   It was time to be happy .   I thought about the word , and that was it . I stood up and began to feel myself becoming one of those people who could n't even recognize it .   I thought about the word , and then I realized how bad it was . I thought about it .   In fairness , I still could n't hear it , but I could n't hear it .   I started shaking , and finally I realized how long I had been trying to make something right .   Soon , it was over . I opened my hands and held them out , and put them in my hands , and with the words , I began to feel more and more happy .   I tried to make a better word , but it was n't the same .   I did n't .   I did n't care , I only could , take it out and go to the same place I did .   It was the one that all the people did n't know who it was .
“ You could feel the deep , empty air ? ” Asked Tim , staring at the closet door .   “ That ’ s all kinds of weird , ” said the older Tim . “ I guess I ’ ll have to take a bit of an apology to you . Maybe I can just pick up a little old paper tomorrow. ”   Tim sat down on his bed and took a shower . The towel that covered his face had to clean it up , and the whole thing was covered in blood . “ We ’ ve been getting all the time. ”   “ Why are we out here ? ” asked Tim , turning to look at the man who was next to the door .   “ Maybe we can just see some of those things we ’ ve done in school . But I ’ ve always wanted to change . There is only one thing that matters to me. ”   “ Now , I ’ m going to ask you a question , ” said Tim , stepping back into the room .   The man was taking a few steps forward , and then looked at his hands . “ You don ’ t want to continue with it , and there is no need to go back. ”   Tim sat up from his bed and looked at the door , just staring at everything else in the closet . The knife that he had in his hand and the knife she was holding in his hand .   Tim stood up . “ I… I was just trying to summon you. ”   Tim looked at the closet door . As if he was finally right , it didn ’ t see fit .   “ So , ” said the man , almost holding his hands up . “ After your parents ’ death , you couldn ’ t get our bodies together . Remember , you ’ re old now. ”   “ Yes , ” Tim said , raising his hand up . “ I just… I just… ”   “ That ’ s right. ”   “ Well , ” said the man . “ And there are so many things that do happen to you , ” he said . They were both angry and frustrated at his mother .   Tim thought about it all again .   “ Then what if we didn ’ t know what happened to you ? ” asked the man . He had been sitting in his room for the last few hours . “ We ’ ll start to lose our weapons before they get up . And… you ’ re always so old now . Now , you can see the strange stuff all over the room ... ”   “ Thanks , Tim . Well I ’ m glad I was finally able to finish my ritual. ”   “ That sounds weird , ” said Tim .   “ I ’ m not sure , ” said the man , grabbing the covers . “ I ’ ve had to summon you now. ”   “ Alright , ” said the doctor , pushing on his hair . “ And the last thing I remember was your magic. ”   “ No , honey , this is so stupid . You should be worried. ”   “ No , not at all . It doesn ’ t answer much , ” whispered Tim . “ Everyone else likes the power that has possessed you . I ’ m pretty sure we ’ re both a sort of group of friends , but in fact I ’ m getting much more than a little bit more confused. ”   “ That ’ s fine . But I just don ’ t have a lot of feelings , ” said Tim .   “ We said that we should be proud of you. ”   “ Wait , ” said the man . “ I ’ ve also seen the good stuff for years. ”   “ Right ? Like , the good stuff you ’ ve done at the time . So , I need to make sure that you do n't expect to be able to become a member of the community -- ”   “ You know , ” said the man . “ Do you know how to do it ? ”   “ Well , I can not just have a job… ” said the man , taking a deep breath .   “ Do you know what ? ” said the man . �
I sat on the bench reading the newspaper . I do n't have any trouble with the story . There 's no catch in it .   You come out of the world just a few yards away . You ca n't walk . You ca n't walk . You ca n't move . You ca n't do anything . You wo n't walk . You ca n't walk . You ca n't walk . The world 's not so different .   You 're standing in the middle of the park . You ca n't sit . You ca n't . You ca n't talk . You ca n't speak .   You ca n't . You ca n't . You ca n't . You ca n't *feel* anything . You ca n't move . All you know is that you 're moving .   You ca n't do anything . Please do n't . I ca n't . Please do n't .   You ca n't .   You ca n't . She ca n't . The world is this . I ca n't . Her is me . I ca n't .   Look . Please do n't .   You 're staring .   If she 's staring .   It 's just a dream .
*Shit ! *   I had given up on the scene , and was surprised when I was standing on the floor , with a knife aimed at me as I screamed my name . The woman was dressed in white shorts and an in-front of me . She spoke through a mask of an ear-splattering laugh .   `` Well then , how do you come ... ? '' I shouted , my mouth moving as I heard her voice call again . An apology and a nod from the woman , I could n't help but gasp .   `` Then why do n't you come do something you want to say ? '' She gestured in a way that made me look like she was trying to take off my outfit .   She simply laughed and grinned . `` It 's not so ... what do you want ? ''   Now I do n't dare say anything , just because I knew what possessed my attention . `` What exactly do you want ? '' The woman replied .   I did not falter , and I just began to sob . `` I do n't want to be stupid , '' I said , the face of a gun pointed at me , but I did not protest . The woman did not move , but she glanced to the man and said `` You do n't want to be foolish . ''   The woman nodded . The gun pointed at me and said `` My name is Tim , and I want to live your own life . ''   The woman frowned and said `` Here , let me be a woman ! ''   I could n't help but laugh . `` What 's up ? ''   `` Everything you want to know ? '' I asked .   `` That 's my name , Tim . '' She said .   `` I 'm your wife , and I 'm your wife . '' I said . I turned away .   `` I suppose you 're not your wife . '' She smiled . `` Or your wife . ''   I looked at her for a second . `` Well , I guess you 're a kid . '' I said . `` You 're a girl , well , that 's not my question . ''   The woman 's face changed . `` Well , what do you want to know ? I mean , I get to be stupid . ''   `` How did you get off my feet ? '' I lied . `` How did you get on my feet ? ''   She nodded . `` Did you say something about some sort of joke ? ''   The woman laughed and nodded . `` You think your wife is a girl ? '' She smirked . `` No , that 's not a joke . You go around your shoes and dress and dress . ''   `` It 's just ... The dress could be a flower ? '' I asked . She did a little bit of a smile . What kind of joke would she have to look like ?   `` I know . '' She said . `` ... '' She said . `` No , I just want to give her a chance . ''   I could n't help but smile . `` That 's simple , Tim . I am smart . I want to be smart . ''   She nodded . `` This is the first thing I have ever done to her . '' She said . `` That 's not how I know . You know they did a good thing . You can steal your heart and face it and face it and face it with it . And just then you go around your shoes and look at them , '' she said .   `` I know . You 're real . '' I said , but the woman did not say anything .   She stopped and said `` Do you have any questions ? ''   `` I have n't asked anyone for this , but what 's more interesting than I am . '' She said . `` It 's pretty rare . You 're one of those people who can afford to rent your identity in a less-than-light money . ''   `` Tell me the truth . Tell me everything . I do really owe you the money owed , and how do you know how long it will be worth being here ? '' I asked .   She smiled a while . `` I have n't even asked anyone for that , you 're not . '' I said , `` You know how hard it will be for you to do something so much ? ''   `` Um , then , I got to buy a person money ? '' She said .   `` But I do n't think so , anyway ,
`` Hey , you 're awake . ''   The world around me begins to swirl into the deep crimson of the Earth . After all , this was n't a very *very* perfect place . I 'm not going to do it .   `` I think that 's your problem . ''   `` I 'm dead . ''   `` Yes , I knew . ''   `` It was n't my fault . ''   `` I forgot to lie . You did n't have to lie . You did n't have to lie . ''   `` Do n't look at what I mean . ''   `` You 're dead , do n't look at me . ''   `` It 's not even your fault . I do n't have to lie . You do n't have to lie . ''   `` You did n't have to lie . It 's your fault . ''   `` Is that why you kept lying ? ''   `` Yes . I do n't deserve to lie . I did care . They only let me go . ''   `` That 's my fault . ''   I pause . This is this ... This is not heaven , not heaven .   `` You 're the only one here . You ca n't live . All of this is the one place I get to take care of . ''   `` I know you do n't have to die . What does it matter ? ''   `` You wo n't have to lie . And I wo n't have to lie . You ca n't live anymore . ''   `` You 're not . You can live again . ''   Tears pour down my face .   `` Do n't act like this , you 're wrong . I do n't know . I 'm here . ''   `` You 're not . ''   `` Are you ? ''   `` You could live more than I do . But I do n't . ''   `` But what is wrong with you ? This is Heaven . ''   `` What is wrong with you ? ''   `` You 're not there . ''   `` There 's no way you could be content . ''   `` I know . ''   `` I know . But you know . It 's not our fault . ''   `` No . ''   `` I know . ''   `` Then why would you ? Why would you be there . ''   `` Because of the pain . That is why you were there . ''   `` You 're thinking . Is this the reason you were here . ''   `` This is the right room . ''   For a moment , I thought I was confused , but I did n't know what it meant . I did n't see the room I was looking at . This was actually a room , not just a furniture , but a floor . I could feel it . As the door opened , I heard a deafening knocking .   ... ... ...   I paused . I felt no pity .   ... ... ... ...   ... ... ... ...   ...  *It 's ok . *   `` Please . ''   I felt nothing . The room was dark and dark . I knew it .   ... ... ... ...   ... ... ... ...   ... ... ... ...   ... ... > One person who chose to live *after* *after* *this* **life** ended* .   ...   > One person , who chose to live ...   > One person , who chose to lived a happy life .

They say that someone is a hero . They say that someone gets hurt , but one word gets worse . That 's why she writes words like this of every word . It 's just a word , she 's always able to communicate . Like a curse for anyone who has tried for many years has spoken for herself . How can it be so bad ? This has to be going on in some way , like a crazy person .   She did n't know exactly why , or why , but it was her life that led to her death . She had a lot of times , a lot of things she would say about people . Someone who was very good at getting hurt . If she could n't just stay away from the rest of them , someone would say , `` Good . '' But that was as bad as that . She had a lot of time left for her life she could n't be out of here . So when she said that . The only she could live in here had a lot of time left . There was always something about being hurt . The only thing she had left was that she was n't in here . She was one of those pills . She 've never been out of here before , but it was the same . She knew she was a hero . She had been quiet in this world just a few years ago . It 's a beautiful sight for years . She could see it in his eyes , one of his eyes . She even felt so happy when she said that .   He was her friend . He was everything he had known , and her name was his . She could not remember him , and he was , but she did n't know that . She knew all the time . She could not remember , but that was the thing in her life . She could not remember him , but she knew that he was n't alone . She loved him . She loved him . She loved him . But what was he about to do now ? She knew that something was different . So she knew that it was his own fault , that made her happy .   She was n't sad anymore . It was her fault that she was happy .
`` I just wanted to say , '' the man said , pointing to the small boy standing on the dais in front of him . He was in a dark black suit with a briefcase hanging over his head and a man with an expensive suit with a clipboard and a large frame with the light blue tie and what looked like a massive black office on top . The man stood up and started walking towards the table .   `` My name is Richard . The 'I 'm here for you , are you who 's in charge of being called ? '' The man asked , as if he was in some form of trance .   `` Why ? '' The man prompted , as if this had been the first time he had noticed the man was standing in front of him .   `` I 've come to tell you what kind of people say . I 'm here for you . '' The man said , as if he were doing some sort of trick .   `` I 've seen your actions . I could n't even tell you what kind of people say . '' The man stated , as if he was seriously trying to get this mad .   `` Who cares ? '' The man asked .   `` You want us to say . I 've come to tell you what kind of people say . I want you to say this . '' The man said , as if he was n't joking .   `` I want to say that . '' The man stated , as if he was about to ask something , and he did n't answer .   The man continued walking towards the stage as if he was about to ask if anyone would know . He walked the stage and looked around at the man , asking if anyone else was there and what was wrong .   `` What has happened to him ? '' The man said , while walking towards the man .   `` He 's ... who 's here . '' The man said , as if he was doing something .   The man stepped away from the counter and stepped inside . The man walked over and looked in the eye .   `` He 's done . He 's done . He 's done . He 's done . He 's done . He 's done . '' The man said , as if he was trying to find something to say .   The man took the first steps towards the man , and reached into his backpack . The man pulled out a small teddy bear , and shoved it back . He looked towards the man .   The man turned to the man , as if nothing had happened . He looked back at the man and said , `` It 's kind of a miracle . '' The man sighed . He turned to face the man , and then he was startled . He only stared at the man in the eye , as if he were trying to reach inside and pull out a teddy bear . He began to cry .   `` But then why do n't you tell me ? '' The man asked , as if he was doing something . `` My name is Richard , and I must explain it . '' The man began to cry . `` No , I do n't see it . Everyone has . '' The man said , staring at the Teddy . He was crying . So angry at the man . `` I am here for you , Richard . I 'm here for you . The world has moved from just to so long ago , so long . ''   The man said , as if he was saying something to the man , but nothing happened . The Teddy began to cry , as if it were something he could n't hear .   `` Who is this ? Why are you crying ? '' The man asked , pleading and pleading .   The man responded , as if he was trying to say something but his voice was weak , and barely audible . The Teddy cried out , and the Teddy cried out again .   `` I 'm here for you , Richard . Will you do something ? '' The man asked , as if he was trying to say something .   The Teddy said , in his booming voice , `` I know what 's coming . I know what 's coming . '' The Teddy said , and then heard it , and with a loud *click* , two men saw the Teddy .   The other two men saw Richard and the Teddy , and the Teddy in the eyes , and the Teddy . The Teddy did n't react , even though the Teddy said he was n't speaking , or the Teddy did n't answer . The Teddy said , `` It is because of his voice , and you , too
**Part 3**   `` Please . '' The judge was visibly upset ; he knew he had done this for the past few years . The judge was the only one who could have been convicted . `` I 've been waiting for a long time . ''   **Part 1**   The judge , well , did n't care . He still had n't done it for the past 72 years , and had been thinking hard about the situation . He really did n't want to be here for the last 5 years , but this time it would be best for him to be be here . The prosecution sat expectantly , the tension in his presence .   `` So , the judge , , Mr . Ahem , I am the defendant , as I was accused of guilty of murder . ''   **Part 3**   `` The prosecutor , of course , did n't commit the murder of innocent people though . I 've been debating that if this case is guilty , it seems , I have no clue what a crime I 've committed that does . I 've been trying to make it into action with my victims for ages . I 've been trying to make it into action with one of my victims . ''   **Part 3**   `` So , now , you did this for me ? I 've already decided that this is n't going to happen ''   **Part 3**   `` Yes . Well , you just were n't very interested in giving me a chance to spend your life trying to kill me . I *know* about this , but you 're such a dick , and I do n't even know what this is . Are you certain that I 'm guilty ? ''   **Part 3**   `` What ? I 'm sorry , sir , I do n't know what I 'm afraid of . Would you like to know what I did ? ''   **Part 3**   `` I did n't . I 'm just saying , my wife and child in the family are going to have to have to get her mother mother in a car accident of sorts . I have no idea what I did . I have no idea what I did to deserve such a terrible fate , but I 've already been able to see the defendant 's face as he 's dragged away from my body . This is n't what you did to deserve this , but I can see my own skin and skin and skin , and that 's what I had . Do n't ask for it now . ''   **Part 4**   The judge sat expectantly , his head slightly agape .   `` I was wondering if I 'm guilty because you chose to die . Or if I did n't deserve it if I wanted to -- ''   **Part 5**   The judge paused , staring at the defendant . He considered what the trial had to do .   `` I do n't . I do n't think I 've found it . I 've killed every other person in the known way . I think I 've lost all of my ability to do this . I think I 've been done this before . I think I 've done this because I 've had a lot of people working at this point . That 's how I 've done this for myself . People are living lives with people who are sitting here with happiness and pain . ''   **Part 4**   `` The same as before . At the same time , I know what happens . I 'm a monster , and I just want to be back on this earth . I 'm ... I really do n't know what 's going on , but seeing as I did this , I think it can be worse . I really do n't feel like I died , but I 've been going through this procedure for a long time now . I do n't feel like I killed anyone else . I do n't think I deserve it . For all I 've done , it 's not like I am the only one who can get my attention I did this . But I do n't have to give up for it . People do n't like this , but they do . I do n't deserve it. ''   **Part 5**   The judge was clearly on the verge of tears , and he was clearly seeing tears on his face .   `` I do n't know what 's going on , but sometimes you do realize what ? When you make it , you just do n't know what 's going on . I love you . I do
My parents had been talking about my job , and told me I was dreaming of it .   It had been a while since . I had known it was n't real , and I tried to hide it . I had said thank you that . Then again , I had been forced to hide it in their basement .   I have been in the kitchen for nearly half a year now . The door was open , and a black figure came into the hall . He was wearing a dirty red hat and a dirty hat . It was a funny coincidence .   `` Hello , I have been busy lately . This is weird , and I are at a good spot here with friends , '' he said .   I nodded , and then back to my room . He walked to my door and threw open his hat .   I looked at him and smiled . `` Congratulations , I have been so kind to you before . ''   `` Is that a nice surprise that you brought to me ? ''   I nodded , and then walked back to my room . He waved , and I walked to the end of the hall . I walked to the back of the room , out into the rain . He walked to my room , and I placed a hand on a handle . He turned and walked over . He waved and pulled off a large hat . I lifted it , and I heard him step out .   I was shocked when I heard a voice from my apartment , and a man in black spoke .   `` I do n't want to take risks , '' I said . I made sure he was right , but also had a few other words that would be stuck in my mouth .   I smiled and went to the back room . One man walked down the hall , and held one arm on a lever . I smiled so hard it made my heart pound .   I turned around to see the man standing in the corner , and the other man stood in the street . He stared at me , and I stared at his arm . He made his face more wet with tears , and he looked at me . I laughed .   `` I want to take risks for a while , '' he said and I pointed at the other two of the other two of them . He started waving at me , his hands were bloody . He was right . I sat down , and I looked at his hand . I looked at my wrist .   `` I am looking too tired to tell you how I managed to survive . ''   `` Thank you . '' He handed me the mask , and held it up .   The man produced a pair of scissors from his jacket .   `` It 's just so hard , and I think I did n't have trouble sleeping with you . ''   I held it up .   `` Really ? '' He asked .   I looked again at his hands . I sighed and went to the kitchen .
I 'm still playing in the game , no light . The game is over . I will make the perfect choice .   I am sitting there waiting this moment , waiting for something to happen . I 'm here to finally die , I am here to die , I am here to die , I 'm here to die and I 've been here for two weeks until I am n't actually here to die , no matter how many years I 've lived , I ca n't walk , and I am here to die .   I reach my hand to touch my face , but a crack of my arm causes me to move . I do n't want to die , I do n't want to die .   I take one last look at myself at the same place . I wonder how long I 've been here , what should I have known ? I miss this life . I loved this life . I smiled , but then I remembered the look of someone in a blue shirt that was there . The kind of smile that people would look like . I had n't seen myself for months now . I had n't seen myself in years , but I knew I was here to die .   The game is over . It 's over . It 's over . There is a time when everyone else says `` I was here to die . ''   I am stuck in this game . I do n't want to die ! There is no time to kill , but what can I have done ? That was impossible . I am here to die , and I 'll die . I 'm here to die , and I live again , and I 'm here to die .   Time is over . I ca n't change this now , but not before .   I ca n't change that now , but I 'm here to die now .   I 'm here to die .   I 'm here to die , my mother says `` I 'm here to die . This is the last time I 've lived . There is no time for me now . ''   I 'm here to die , but I know it is impossible . I 'm here because of these rules . I am here to die . How do I die ?   I ca n't change that now , and as if I am , I feel like I am just here to die , as if I am . I 'm here to die , because of these rules . I will die somehow , but it 's all in my life . The world around me is a place where I live , where everything feels perfect and to be back to normal . I ca n't change that now .   I am here to die now . Am I here to die ? The day after this , I die .   I do n't want to kill again , but I can not change that anymore , because I need to live soon . I do n't want to die anymore .
When you hit those first words ,  To find a way to escape  to escape on you with your life .  If you could n't understand  To escape on those first words ,  To fall on the ground , to leave forever ,  To embrace it until you 're alone in the universe , to the void ,  To feel free when you are alone in the world .                                                                                                              
Nailed by the heavy foot of his saddle , the wind would break the darkness . He could see the light coming from the horizon , and the sun in the distance was shining and he could already hear the distant hum of his horse . The wind was getting thinner and thinner , and he could feel the familiar scent of wafting pine and pine in his ears .   The wind was almost a sweet scent for the scent of pine , the scent of pine and marsh ’ s scent brought him closer to the trees . He picked up the pine logs , and a little breeze flooded the room . The sun was still shining and he could see the smoke coming from everywhere .   He touched the pine logs and looked up . He could smell the wet , black smog that permeated the air . There were dozens of trees lying on the ground , and there were hundreds of them , each seemingly out of the way . Nothing else was different . Nothing else was different .   His horse was about to flip back in his saddle , but he could feel the heat coming from him now . He had to think , and now he was walking towards the door .   “ Hey , aren ’ t you ? ” he asked . He could hear the rustling of leaves and rustling leaves . He looked up , then back at the house . It was a small room and three rooms . This place was a set of benches , and only a small area with two chairs . He sat back up , and was taken aback by the sound of the sun . He took a drag from the cigarette and shook the dust from the branches .   “ Well what was this place ? ” he asked , and then he looked up . The light only seemed to light up and he opened the door and began walking towards it . He walked to the back door , and was greeted by the small doorway that covered the place . He took a step back . He knew it had to be his first birthday , and as soon as he opened the door , he stopped in there . He wore on a shirt like a blanket , and he had a pair of trousers , but was unable to move . He was confused , and knew that this was not his real weapon . He saw his face , and looked up at the old man . “ What have you done to me ? ” he asked , after a few moments he said , “ No , you must be my guest. ” He walked to it a little , and started to walk down the hall with a flourish . He walked over to the old man as he walked towards the door , but he couldnt see him coming . He walked over to the door and picked up the small man with the small man .   “ Do n't be afraid about me man , I do n't think I can help you. ” He asked , feeling a sharp pain in his arm . He could n't see anything , he could n't see anything else , he could n't see anything , and nothing was safe . He was n't scared , he just wanted to be scared but he could see what happened .   He reached the door and the man went down the hall . He knocked it too hard , and I suddenly realized that there was just a single room around me . He began looking back at the man , and he saw that he had a large window sitting at the end of the hall , and he knew immediately that if he sat there , reading the book , he could see his face .   “ What have you done to me man ? ” he asked . He looked down at the sky and saw that the sun had moved at least a few feet from the window , and suddenly he felt that he was back in his hand . This had to be his first birthday , at least a couple years ago today . It was amazing how the sun had moved , and I looked around for the sign .   “ It has to be something about it man. ” He said , and the man looked back at his hand . “ I have n't seen anything for years. ”   “ I love you man , but in the end , your skin grows fat and the only color is the color you want to be. ” He looked back at the old man , and saw his eyes begin to light up . He looked back at the wooden man , and his face grew grim . “ I have a long story . I have a story . I have traveled most of the realms . I have lived most of the worlds . If you came , I would never be able to make a difference . From there , I have lived my life in this world . I have lived my life in a land where those who have lived my life ? ” The
The funeral bells rang . Mark was not an ordinary man , but an old man with an old gilded robe and a white dress with a white crown and a white gown . He had a soft , old manish complexion and a wrinkled hand made in half a decade . He was dressed in black and white , with long hair and bald eyes . Mark looked down at the coffin to see the crowd gathered .   `` What is it ? '' he asked .  `` My grandfather , had n't it seen him since he was young . I told him about our best friend ... but none of us even knew him . I told him . '' Mark had a look of disapproval on his face that he was not looking for . `` I told him about his family . His death has been great . ''  `` What ? '' Mark managed to ask . `` I told him about his family . He told everyone about his family . He told them about his family . He told them about how his family did n't die . He told them to talk about his family . They told him about their family . ''  `` You see , this is ... a mystery . He never knew a person . '' The crowd chanted . Mark looked up at the man , `` Then he promised himself to tell everyone who was in the wrong place . Until they came back . '' As the man stepped away the crowd looked around the crowd . Mark caught his breath and immediately got up . He felt the familiar sensation of being alive .   `` How did you end up with my family after I was born ? '' Mark asked . `` I know that is . I know that and you do n't understand why I was born . I 've never told you about the family before . ''  `` I do n't know . I 'm not sure what you *want* to tell me . I 've always hated you , but I do n't like that . I know exactly what you 're doing now . I can feel the sadness in your eyes . ''  `` I remember your death over the years . We were both together . I know it all all , but I 've never seen you before . I know that is true . I have n't told you about it yet . I have been told how to end up with my family . I know that I 'm not alone , because I know . I 've never been to this man before . I am not alone . '' The crowd roared . `` What do you want ? ''  `` You want to know that I wo n't do anything longer . ''  `` I know . I 'm not waiting for my family . They all know I 've lived these centuries . I know that it 's ... a lie . I do n't know . '' Mark said , `` You 'll feel it . ''   `` I know . I feel nothing . It do n't feel empty . I feel nothing . I know that if we do n't know that , it 's over . I know . But I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . . I know . ''  `` You know . '' The crowd cheered and cheered . Mark and his friends cheered and cheered and laughed . `` You know . I know . You can tell me . I know . I know . ''   My face went dark . I knew . `` Just ... wait . Stop ! '' The crowd cheered and cheered . Mark and his friends cheered and hugged .   `` I know . '' The crowd cheered and cheered and cheered . Mark smiled and waved and said the words .
“ Give it man , ” I demanded , my eyes focused between heavy , grim teeth . “ It will be your intention ” , I said , “ to the man . Just a matter of time . Give it man . You ca n't let him give me a choice for people who refuse , ” I said , my eyes narrowing . “ Give it man , give it man. ” I looked back , my eyes already dilated and my eyes narrowed . “ There was no way he was supposed to , I just wanted him to give it a choice . We were supposed to be free. ”   The voice was deep , and deep , and booming . I turned around , my eyes darting at the man . “ That man has to take his own kind . He has to take his own kind ” , I said , extending my hand . “ You must be free . Give it man. ”   The man held up his hand . “ Let it happen Mr. Lucifer . Calm down . I will come back . Tell it man ” , I nodded . “ Let it happen again . You must not listen. ”   “ What do you mean ? ” I asked .   “ Give it man , give it man . Give it man. ” The man raised his hand . “ Give it man. ”   With that the man stepped off of his vehicle , sliding down it . The man approached , raising a hand . “ Take it man ! Let it in. ”   The man took it all in , lifting it around her once again . “ Please give it the man . Make it you good ” . She pulled it around her waist , one hand trailing across the air . I stared at him . “ It will be my intention . For this man , let it in , do it in. ”   “ Let it act man. ” He pulled up her arm , brushing it away from her face . “ Let it die , your will . Let it be known. ”   The man let out a powerful laugh , but still they did not respond to the voice . He paused until he touched her hand . “ Let it die . Please. ”   The man stood , confused . He did not look up at my feet . “ Let it die man ? Let it die. ”   “ Give it man ! ” I said , but I pushed them again . “ Let it die . Let that die man. ”   A deep sigh began to fill the room . “ Let it die man . Kill that man. ”   The man rose and walked away . I was gone . I was gone . My body was gone . I was gone . I was gone . I had gone .
The small stream of glass was a lovely sight , not a single word , not the type that would have meant anything to have just been seen . One could have taken a seat from an entire group of people . It seemed I wasn ’ t listening as the girls were talking , but I knew at some point it was in the middle of nowhere . A girl is sitting in a dark chair , while I stood next to her . “ Hey there , buddy ! ”   The girl says in a voice that is not good enough to contain her anger . She ’ s quiet , though . It was just ... off . Everything seemed to be getting darker . I don ’ t know what to do . I only just didn ’ t want to look at her , then looked at her . She was a young girl , and she was young , and she wasn ’ t very , very much either . She was also very tall , wearing a dress that looks kind of like her big , and her hair was dyed and a bit more , but she was sitting in front of a small girl . She looked the same , but she wasn ’ t beautiful . It was just a girl , but she looked different .   The girl stands there , looking completely lost in the wind , and starts to walk away . It has some sort of strange vibe . It ’ s a girl that has just seen such a creature , and she ’ s very tall . It looks as if it wasn ’ t a large hand , but as if it ’ s really a small hand .   “ I know that , ok , but that ’ s very scary , would it ? ” He said with a smile , and a nod , a wave of his hand and I can ’ t help but smile at him when he walks away , saying to the girl in an affirmative .   “ It ’ s definitely a strange place , ” I say , not looking back at her . It doesn ’ t seem like this is a foreign place . The girl grabs it in the air and takes the seat next to her . She smiles . “ So ? Why aren ’ t you doing this ? ”   “ I ’ ve seen it too many times , ” she says . “ We ’ re friends , so we ’ re friends . We can stay together , because we ’ re friends. ”   I don ’ t know why she had been staring at me , but she doesn ’ t seem to notice . I know she ’ s looking concerned . She looks more terrified , but instead looks back at me . It ’ s time for him to face me , and for a moment I can feel him taking in that weird , fake smile .   “ Well , sometimes , I ’ m scared of you , ” she says . “ You can ’ t look back at me , I know you ’ re very awkward. ”   The blonde looks embarrassed , and then walks away . I look at him expectantly , but he still looks at me . It seems like he isn ’ t holding an object , and he doesn ’ t seem to notice it . Most of his friends think that he ’ s looking at it . The thing on his face says something , “ I ’ m pretty sure that I ’ m pretty sure you should just look look back at me . You know what ? ”   “ Yeah , ” I said , looking at him . “ No , I ’ m quite upset . I ’ m sure you ’ d like to talk to me . That ’ s because of you. ”   She stands there , looking so confused . “ I guess I can ’ t say that you should like to talk to me… ” 
I found a girl in the back of society that changed the world of others . She was a kind girl , maybe , too . But was it not even possible ? She was absolutely beautiful , or so I thought . She was beautiful , beautiful , and sweet for I could n't understand . I knew what I was thinking . She was beautiful , like she wanted me to be , but , she was perfect . She just wanted me to be , no matter what the world of others wanted me to be . And it did n't matter .   I had to protect her . No . I do n't know that . But , I do know that I will be a good person .   For me ( still ) , my heart was broken . I could n't see her , I wanted to know that she loved me ... I do n't know , she lost her sense of self , I know , but my heart was broken . I could n't comprehend how I truly knew what I was seeing . But what I 'm imagining is that I 'm seeing it in my future . A man . I 'm watching the life in the distance when I see him in my future . My soulmate . I do n't know why I feel that . The girl was looking at me with a tear in her eye . I could n't comprehend what I was seeing anymore , but it did n't matter . I did n't know her , or , or what I had known . I do n't know for sure how that will happen , but I have n't discovered anything . I should n't .
A man in a polt shirt and a dark blue tie walked up to one of the ropes holding the man ’ s hands . His neck was too bright for his eyes ...   “ Let me see , ” he said , holding up the chain .   “ Thank you , ” he said . “ But the one in the world is too full to be replaced with a game , ” he said , handing the chain to the man .   The man grinned at him , and said , “ The only rules to go through is the rules . Why you take them so long ? You ’ re not gon na be immortal , and you ’ re gon na die for the last ten years . When you watch , you *do* die for the last six years. ”   The man smiled at him briefly , and answered , “ That ’ s a pretty good gig . I don ’ t want to die , but I can not die for long. ”   The man grabbed the chain and was dragged away on the island until he stopped looking . His hands went cold as he closed his eyes .   The man had returned to his surroundings , and the man was gone . The floor was covered and covered in splattered , and he had gone to sleep .   “ I feel like you ’ re going to die . A man who can not die for the last twenty years . This is my life . I ’ m going to die for my life for my life . My work is going to go to work. ”   The man looked up at the man and said , “ And you ’ re not gon na die for the last three years . Life is worth nothing . Have you ever fallen for a reason ? ”   His eyes went wide as he spoke .   “ You think you ’ ll die for the last twenty years or you ’ ll die for the last twenty years on his death ? ” The man turned and said , “ No , I don ’ t think you will die for a long time . You never should have died for this . Your life is worth nothing. ”   The man turned and walked out , into the ocean with the chain running off of him .   “ Are you afraid to kill yourself ? ” The man asked , “ To Death , you don ’ t have to die for the last twenty years . You want to die for you. ”   The man smiled at him , and said , “ That ’ s a good thing . Things have much better to do . Do you remember the last twenty years ? I did . I did . I was . I was . Just . I fell for an empty island with my own hands on my hips . I did . I killed you and then when you died , you could live for the better . You wouldn ’ t have died on the boat anymore , but I don ’ t think you ’ re going to die with the rope anymore . You ’ re not going to die for the rest . Even if I die , it better be in life than you ever see. ”   The man looked at the rope sitting against the wall , and said , “ I do not think I die for the last twenty years . But for the last twenty years , I ’ m just an idiot. ”   The man let out a heavy sigh , and said , “ You ’ re not going to die for now , and you ’ ll be the last twenty years . You need to get rid of your misery and torment . Because you don ’ t die for the remaining hundred years . You will wake up for the last seventy years . You will set up a death sentence for a thousand years , and then you will die . But after that , you will fade into the abyss again . But you ’ re here to die for the last ninety years . It will be the last eighty years . And if you die , you will have to die for the next twenty years . And as the final forty years go . But I can not die for my own death . But I can not die for the last twenty years . ''   The man shook his head , “ That is it , ” he said , and gestured to the rope .   The man frowned .   “ So , does you die for a hundred years ? ”   The man was in a wheelchair now , and he dropped to his knees .   “ Because you owe me a thousand years , ” he said
Lying out was a small settlement . In the vastness of the plains all of the lands were once barren and pristine . Many of them were lying . Some perished , others stayed in disbelief for some time . Others cried out , and each death cried out . Some died , others died , others died , others died , others perished . Others died , but all died , of their deaths .   So here we stood , in the same place and we stood , on top of the throne . A small wooden throne was encased in a tree that reminded us of our ancestors . But with a single eye , what glowed red on the ground and with the same blood and gore as a beautiful gold ring .   She came alive and found what she had done . In the back of her mind , a simple message .   `` Come , come , she 'll kill you . ''   Her voice broke through the air , and she turned to speak , `` but she 's already dead . ''   The other villagers nodded , and the same time , and all of the others died . A single tear rolled down her face . She looked into the sky , and saw a single tear fall down her cheek .
**So I was wondering if she could just ask me if she did n't specify that I was n't exactly the type of person who 's been asked for ? **   This is insane . I 'm stuck here trying to find these people . I 'm stuck here .   **Really , I 'm not sure why I 'm here . Just a few seconds away from me like everyone else . **   I guess I 'm not the type of person who 's waiting for me . But I 'm not . If she has n't said anything , I really might have heard something . She looks up at me with the look of contempt I 've been looking for .   **So what happened in the afterlife ? **   Well , I 'm not certain this is actually quite a good question .   **Why am I here ? **   Well , you 've answered the question . I 'm not sure who says this . And this is a question , right ?   **Because you know , it 's your first question . **   Ah , yes . Let me answer it .   **You 've answered the question . **   Well , I 'm actually saying something . And you ... You never answered the question .   **It seems you 've answered the question . **   I 've answered the question . I 'd never answered the question so fast . I 'm surprised when she says something . *Oh , look , I 'm still here . I 'm supposed to answer that now . *   Oh . So what if she does n't say anything for me ?   **Oh , please , you 've explained . I 've answered many things and that 's how it works . You 've explained so much too much . **   Oh , really ? I 'm not sure what seems to be a question . *Oh God , let 's see ... *   Well I 'm talking like the question will play out for us . I 'll tell her before she finishes , if I am not ... I 'm not not trying to show up for the fact that I was not *sure* what she 's hearing here . And I 'm talking like the sort of person that you 're talking to . Just a few seconds left , and I 'm pretty sure that I see it for them . *I 'm trying to call that out , * and so I can get this out of here . *   And I 'm walking over to the side of the pathway , and I should n't have used these steps to really climb down . But I 'm still looking around , and I have n't noticed a damn thing in the first place . I 'm walking around the path .   And , right now , I 'm stuck here .   Wait , what ? I think I 'm in a cage , and I see it all around me . I 'm moving . I 'm moving . So much . So much ! No , no , I do n't think I 'm coming here ... I 'm moving .   I do n't think I 'm out here too . So long ! So much so that I can get there to get there to answer the question .   **Why did I need to ask ? **   I think I 'm in a cage . *This was a test . * So much so that 's not what I did .   Okay , where do I go ? I do n't know . Okay .   Okay , uh , I 'm not going for this . We 're going to put up . I want to take it out .   **Sure , it 's nice to walk over to the place to put up a nice sign . Would you like us to talk ?   Yeah , probably . Thanks . You have a rather interesting job , really .   **Sorry , what does everyone else know ? Why did I need to go to the place to try to get it out now ? **   Exactly . I 'm not going to ask that question , because I 'm going for this . So much .   **Well , I 'm gon na ask . **   So it 's nice to meet all of those friends . I 'm going for this ? What do I get ! I ca n't go through this . I ca n't be telling you , right ?   Anyway , I 'm here
`` Hey . What ? Is that a joke ? ''   I stood there , confused . `` Do you know what the next ? ''   I stepped closer , and sighed . `` What the hell are you doing ? '' I asked the agent in my suit .   This was getting better .   I got up , and walked out the door without so much as a thought . How rude . The agent was already standing by my side as if he was an idiot .   `` Is that the first time in life ? ''   I got up and went back to my work bench . I was n't sure why I was still there , but I was n't sure . I was just in the middle of a boring office building and was pretty sure I was there .   `` He 's about to go through the motions . ''   I said my job : I 've got to be moving through the motions . I stopped to stare at the group . I was surprised at most of the group 's faces . They seemed to be looking at me .   `` You 're just using the word 's 'The Matrix ' ' . '' I 'm genuinely curious . Who am I kidding ? Who am I kidding ? I 'm just trying to get to that .   `` Sure people are . ''   I got there and left . I could n't say I was wrong . I mean , he can smell me and the smell of bacon and bacon . But he 's just watching me . I 've gotten it . I 'm glad I 've been there for so long .   `` Sorry , but you ca n't have any of those words . ''   `` Ok , I do n't really know why I 'm here . ''   The group ran over to the door and grabbed me by the shoulder . I turned to follow .   `` What do you work for ? '' I asked , and they all looked at me like they were smiling . They were talking around me .   `` You got ta be kidding me , please . ''   `` Why ? ''   I did n't notice . I glanced at my watch .   `` Why ? Why would you have to be so sad if you were n't there ? ''   The group went over to me and grabbed me by the shoulder . They looked at me like I was watching a football field .   `` Is this the first time in many years ? ''   I looked at the hand with a mischievous wink .   `` No , I did . ''   `` So what are you doing ? ''   They all looked at me .   `` Well , I 'm doing my job . ''   `` So , what do you do ? ''   I smiled and gave you a quick kiss . I laughed .   `` Well , I do n't have any friends . I do . But the way you do after that is n't there , my family does n't feel like I have a family . ''   I turned away and walked to the kitchen .   `` Where 's your family . '' I said . I looked around . I was in shock .   `` How are you doing ? ''   I got up and walked out of the kitchen and found the kitchen . I walked over to the entrance to the kitchen to see the door open .  
It 's not like we 've had much fun . We had a rough couple days . Yeah I think we should have been here . So while I had this conversation I would have made some of my favorite tools . Me and my buddies are having our disagreements .   About 5 hours ago I got a call from the other group as an early winter break . My friends came around the entrance to his car and took turns to see the spot where his car was . He was wearing a worn shirt , his shirt was slightly worn so that it looked like a lot of wear . A man with long black hair and wide eyes spoke up for a moment .   `` Hey you , '' he said . `` Is anyone there ? ''   `` No . '' I said . `` What are you doing here ? ''   `` Hey , I 'm just going to go get a call from the other group . You know we have your business . So close to you . ''   `` Really ? '' he said . `` That 's not the reason we have to go to our first meet . ''   I turned my head and saw the girl who was holding a knife from the other group before he walked over to her , holding it together to the others .   `` What 's your name ? '' I said .   `` I 'm a killer . Do n't you fear me after hearing that man say those words ? ''   He looked at me . `` We did n't have a boyfriend . ''   `` No . ''   `` What do you mean that man ? ''   Silence .   `` It 's an old guy . ''   I started to shake my head . `` You 're just thinking of me to stop you . You ca n't just talk to me without saying that . ''   No response . Just silence . I could see him move towards me and he turned around to face me .   `` Are you sure you can handle this ? '' I said .   He stopped and stopped for a few seconds . I could see his eyes looking into mine . `` Of course not . ''   `` Why . ''   `` If you did n't want to hear that man say those words ? ''   He stopped and looked toward me . `` Because I 'd think I 'd like to live on that one . But I do n't . It 's not like I have any friends . The way you 're feeling . ''   I walked away , avoiding him . `` And you did n't deserve that ? ''   He stood up and took his knife . `` Because I know you think of me and you think of me then that I 'm being a serial killer . You think that 's why I 'm still alive . A serial killer ? No one ever cared about me . '' He walked away carefully and walked behind the car .   `` No , I am thinking of you . But I believe you 've finally talked to me . ''   I walked back into the house , walked in and grabbed the knife from the other group . I walked past the two men as they walked down the street . The girl walked up to me and said , `` Hi , is there any way you can kill me ? '' She just put the knife in her hand and whispered , `` I know . ''   `` No . I 'm not ! ''   `` I guess we 're going to sit and sit together for a long time . ''   She did n't respond , apparently startled .   `` I 've been thinking of you for so much . ''   `` Who are you ! ? ''   Her eyes widened again . `` No , actually . '' She said and walked over to me `` I 'm sorry , but I do n't worry about you . ''   I turned and walked over to the girl and said , `` Listen , I need to stop you . I 'm going to kill you here . '' She put a knife in her hand and held her hands in mine .   I looked into her eyes . `` You 're just getting my own number . ''   `` So what are you talking about ? '' I said , genuinely confused .   She turned back and smiled brightly . `` Are you tired of me ? ''   `` Thank God , it 's been so long . '' I said with a smile . `` It 's just fun for you . ''   `` Oh
`` I love you , '' I said cheerfully , still standing there . I laughed , which made me smile . It was a happy smile .   `` I love you . I love you . I love you . You love me . I love you . I love you . I love you . I loves you . I love you . '' I laughed . I love you more than I could remember when I was younger . I loved you . I love you . I love you . I love you . I love you . '' I kissed my cheek gently . I love you . I love you . I love you . I love you , I love you .   `` I love you . You are mine . I love you . I love YOU . ''   `` If I love you. ``   `` If I love you , you are mine by no means to love me . ''   `` I love you , '' I continued .
`` I 'm here to help you , '' I said , `` You know what I 've done to yourself . ''   `` I 'm sorry , old friend . ''   `` I know . You 're sick , and that 's what I 'll do . ''   `` You go to a park , and I 'll walk back to the park and look for someone to help you . ''   `` It 's okay . ''   `` Then why do you have to help me ? ''   `` Because I left my parents , just like you did before . ''   `` Because no one , no one , I do n't want to help you , right ? ''   `` Because you are sick , but no one really dies , but people are too happy to help me . That wo n't stop me from doing anything , and I 'm also going to meet the worst people in the world . Because the worst of all , is because I 'm the right person to help you . ''   `` When you 've saved me from people , you are the right person to help me , and I know what it does to me . And I just want to help you . ''   I gave my back to the bench in front of me , as if I had heard my mother 's hand on her shoulder . And then we both laughed , and I saw her smiling again .   They hugged and hugged and told me about her , who I loved as much as I loved as I loved as I loved as I did . And they held me , as if I had even won a game . And when I was born , I 'd never truly loved the innocent .   And then , we just let each others reach the park .
As I looked around at my son and said , `` Honey , you 're acting like it 's too late to see you . I 'm sure I 'm okay . ''   My son smirked and said `` I 'm fine . ''   I laid back in bed and looked around to see where he was going . He was gone , and there was n't any lights on his radar . The sun was setting before me , and the small , blue haired man had just turned up .   `` Just relax . ''   His eyes stayed on me for a moment , then he began talking . I could only hear him shouting and shouting . It sounded like a low growl of laughter . I sat back in bed and wiped away the tears from my face . I could n't help but smile .   I could n't say what I meant . I mean , I did n't have to . I could n't say I could n't say what 's going on .   One night , I sat up and said , `` Where 's Mr . Golly ? ''   `` Not quite . '' I said , `` he 's trying to find the source of our daughter . '' I looked up at his eyes .   `` Then what ? ''   `` We just have to wait . ''   He turned around and said , `` we want to know what you think . ''   I took out my phone and called a familiar friend . It was a boy .   `` Do you understand the situation ? ''   `` The time has come . ''   He shrugged and said , `` Where are we going ? ''   I asked , `` Where are my daughter ? ''   He shrugged and said to me , `` We 're going to need you to keep your daughter safe while I walk all the way to his house . ''   He looked at me then , and said , `` No , we 're going to need you . There 's no reason I 'm going to stay here before I go back to my new house , and everything will be okay . ''   I did n't want to leave .   He told me , `` Okay , just breathe , '' he said , `` Just breathe . ''   Then I started sobbing again .   `` What 's wrong ? ''   I stood up from my bed and looked back at the boy . He just looked at me and said , `` I 'm going to need you to help us . ''   He turned around and said , `` Honey , we 'll need you to take your daughter away . ''   I sat back down and said , `` I can save you , I 'll be fine , but please , let me help you . ''   I sighed , `` I 'll help you , David , '' I said , `` I 'll help you . ''   I put my hands around the boy and said , `` You 're going to need you to help her , David . I need you to help her . ''   He walked off and I fell back into bed .   The next morning , I woke up early to see the bright red flash of our daughter . I heard a screeching sound , but there was no rush of adrenaline overcomes me .   I tried to calm myself up , but it was getting louder , and ...   I could n't , and then I heard a faint shuffling across the bedroom , and then I heard the clang of knocking on the wall . I heard a wet crunch and then a cry .   I ran down the stairs , to where my son lay and said , `` We need you to tell her , and she 's happy to give you something to do . ''   I looked up at him , and I heard a muffled voice , `` Wait ... Is that your name ? ''   My son nodded and said , `` You 're going to need my daughter back from her mother , so now we have to go pick that one . ''   `` I 'll stop you , David . '' He walked over to me and touched my baby 's hand .   I had n't heard it out in time , since I was six .   I could n't move , but I heard my son yelling , `` Look , I will do everything . ''   I ran up to his bed and screamed , `` Please , please ! ''  
You are lucky it ’ s not your fault that you are unlucky . But it is not your fault that you are unlucky and brave and lazy , not lucky . And you are lucky you are lucky these days . You have been lucky you just die , your only remaining precious gift to all others ; of all things considered to be your downfall . And for now , it is your fault that you are unlucky , not lucky . And you are lucky you are lucky . You are lucky you are unlucky . And you died long ago . With no other day and no other day , no one will suffer . It is your fault that you are unlucky , not lucky , not lucky . I wish you could die soon , but I am lucky you have to find one place to live .
His chest ached , and he drew the tiny plastic box from under his desk . A piece of cardboard fell to the floor , and his eyes adjusted . It was the same cardboard .   He took a deep breath and breathed .   `` I 'm alive . ''   He sighed , and placed the box back on the desk . `` Think of a way to get out of this mess . '' The letters hung on the wall , but not once had he been able to read it , but this time the words spilled on the letters were not the same .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A small box had been buried in the wall by the wall . The box was lying on the floor beside him , his blood boiling around his ears . His mouth moved in slow motion , and he leaned against the back of the chair , and felt the metal beneath his skin .   `` I need to get back to the mess . '' The box whimpered . His legs heaved , and he made out a large box in front of him .   `` I can get back , I can get back to the mess . '' He held it back out , and they were always there .   The box was the same cardboard .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The box was the same cardboard . It burned around his arms , and he flicked a switch . The box was a piece of cardboard , but that was the same cardboard . Perhaps it was a piece of cardboard ?   It was the same cardboard . In his hand , the box felt empty .
`` Oi , what do you think a genie is when you wish to be free ? ''   `` *I 'm sorry , mom , * he said as he started to wiggle violently . `` *You ca n't have a serious wish . * ''   `` Um ... how 's my problem ? ''   `` Well ... if I want to be free ... I know ... I 'm sorry ... *m ... *you 're really happy ... ''   `` *Oh , I know , Mom . I know . * ''   `` *I 'm sorry , Dad . I know . I know . * ''   `` And , maybe ... ''   `` Dad , why ca n't you just go ? ''   `` ... I know . ''   `` No ... no , it 's *my* problem . I know . ''   `` *So you do n't have the same exact wish ? * ''   `` *But , you should be free , * ''   `` Oh , I know ... ''   `` Whatever you wish is ... * ''
For all eternity , God has died . He had died when his afterlife was ruled as a `` heaven '' , which in turn made him an angel . He wished that it would be this bad . He wished that he could spend eternity as a God and that he would spend eternity in Heaven .   But there was nothing he could do to deserve . He wished that he could spend eternity in the afterlife as a god . But , now that only the best he could do was sit to his own person . He wished that he would be happy , because he was happy that I would lose my balance , because he was happy that he could spend eternity as a god .   He wished that he could spend time with anyone else . He wished that he could spend eternity with all of his friends and family . He wished that he had spent eternity with friends , and that he would be happy , that he could spend eternity with everyone else .   But , here he is because of his sadness . This is why he wishes if he could spend eternity with someone else by his side . Like a coward who is not a coward even a coward . But , he wishes that no one else could , just the guy who gave him a chance to live his life with .   He wish that he could live a life without him . He wished that he could spend eternity with them , because no one else could , was not lonely , because he never wanted to say goodbye , because he knew that he should enjoy the happiness in his heart , because of his love in his heart , because of *anyone* that had ever truly died , because that he loved his chance .   And so he sat . Waiting just outside the gates .   When he finally got to the gates , he saw a figure standing in front of him . One of his friends , wearing an orange coat , stood up and said `` Hello , I am God . I think you must have died . Is that Heaven ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` So , '' said God , `` I am human and am that you ? '' He asked , shocked by what he said . `` Ah ! Are you dead ? ''   `` Yes . '' Said God , `` I am . But , I am real and I am . And yet , I am alone . ''   `` So , '' said God , `` and I am alone ? Is it Heaven or is it ? ''   `` Yes . Yes , but I am alone . ''   `` Well , '' said God , `` but I am alone and there is no heaven that I worship . ''   `` And I am alone . ''   `` Is there *anything* that you loved ? '' said God , `` The world of my people is a dream and I can not forget what you had made . And you 're a life that you are unable to comprehend . But , you will never forget . ''   `` Then why did you love my people ? ''   `` And you will never forget their feelings and feelings and feelings , but never forget them and share every emotion they shared . And this is not Heaven . I love you , because that I am free . And you will never forget my happiness ! I will never forget all that I am . I will never forget your emotions and emotions . And every last moment I will ever forget my happiness , because that nothing will ever be forever . I will never forget my grief . And then I will forget what my happiness is . Just forget that you will never forget your happiness and cherish your true happiness . ''   `` Please , '' God said , confused . `` So , not again . And I will forget my love and love . And the world is beautiful .
It had been about ten years since that day , I had finally found a secret . This meant that , but no one had . Everyone in the class had expected me to find out . There had been a few years of quietness by now , but no one seemed to notice me . I had made a mistake before , and most of the students came flying around the edge of the class . Today was a strange day . Despite the silence , it seemed like a pleasant day . Today was the day that I just arrived at class . I quickly became aware of the noise that filled the room . It was n't my fault . Instead , I was immediately curious that I had some weird presence outside of the school . Whatever I thought , it was a coincidence . I simply stared at the voice . It was in shock that I had somehow gotten out of the room by then .   **Ahh , did I know I could n't hear it ? How could I ? **   I had been quiet , but it was the day that I began to get out of the room before I had even gotten through the door . I had been feeling sick and sick and tired . I started to panic . I began falling asleep , and when I woke up , it was almost entirely dark . I was n't really sure what had happened , or if it was n't any other noise .   **Ohhhh , I 've been asleep for five years ! Who the hell are you ? **   I frantically started looking for my phone , searching for a phone . A second later , I was too scared to know what it was , or what it was . I picked up my phone and pressed the numbers again . I had n't realized yet .   **Ohhhh , um ... ... what the fuck is this ? **   I grabbed my iPod and started flipping it . I had finally been feeling tired , and felt pretty tired . I read something in an unusual language , and realized that it was my teacher . I found out that the voice had been a person before , and that I was not a person . I had never been able to hear a person before .   **Ohh , did I just delete that ? **   I asked myself why the voice was n't there when I said it . I felt slightly embarrassed . I was n't sure how to say this , but I did not think something to say for an hour . I kept going .   **Well , the Voice has been different . They do n't know who it is , and I 'm not sure what it is . I 'm just curious , and I 'm afraid that it 's just someone speaking to whoever it is . **   `` Hello , '' the voice had been different , but it was different . Not unlike the voice I had been talking to , but rather strange . It looked different , but something had different properties . I started to panic , and had no idea where it was . I looked around the room looking for what was going on . The voice was definitely speaking to me , and I did n't know what I was talking to , but I did n't know if it was speaking to me , or if it was speaking to me I would have to admit .   **Sorry , I 've been meaning to try it differently . You always had a power , most of the students have long since been silent and it 's almost time to use it . **   The voice suddenly went silent . I could almost hear it , but he was still alive . I had n't heard it since I was eighteen . I stood up , trying to grab it , and I could feel my arm relax against my leg . *I 've been so stressed , I ca n't help but think back to what I had gotten to what I had just done . *   I turned to walk away . I had n't noticed it before , and when I could pick up the voice , I could n't help but think up .   **Hey , did the voice go silent ? What are you talking about ? **   `` Well , just let me tell you more ! ''   `` No , I 'm not talking to you . I 'm very afraid that you are talking to me . ''   Before I could respond , I turned to my teacher on the other side of the room , and just like that , a hand appeared to reach out and shake , and in a foreign language that seemed to absorb me in the way that I was speaking .   **You 're talking to me . You 're saying that you are talking to me , and that I am speaking to you that I am addressing you . I '
*I have not been in control for years . *   `` Are you serious for ? '' I asked , `` You have to admit that , do you know how many of these things are ? ''   `` What now ? I do n't know . ''   `` How many times have we been in control ? '' I asked , `` Why did n't we have to talk ? ''   `` That 's pretty obvious . You 're just a weird kid with all your clothes because you 're a little fat . See , those things are simple . Most people do n't get sick when you 're here . Most people do n't have any children . Some people do n't want to help out . But there are some people who have some sort of connection for everyone ... whatever happens . ''   `` Those who do n't have any friends anymore . You can just talk to one of them . ''   `` I do n't even know where you are . '' The man spoke , `` You do n't need to help out any of them . I want to hear you get infected . ''   `` That 's strange . ''   `` Sorry . It 's the same thing to you . Do n't let me tell you about this . ''   Well done . With that , they wo n't notice the difference between women , and they wo n't notice that the correlation between genders is much greater .
“ Sir , we ’ ve got to go into the Navy . We can hear them in the distance . Tell them to go there , and just keep going there. ”   “ Let ’ s go to the beach and tell them to go there. ” The beach was quiet , and the two men sat , their feet pressed against the red sand .   “ It ’ s going to be a long time. ” He said as they jumped out of the boat onto a boat . They weren ’ t sure why the creatures were here .   “ We ’ ll be about to get out . We can ’ t go anywhere soon. ” The sea was quiet but the men on the boat couldn ’ t see them . The boat was now in the front . It was a mountain of water , so it was full of water and it gave up .   “ We ’ ll be back in the distance for a second. ” The fog picked up the edge of the water and a boat ran off . It sped across the beach and into the air .   As the boat moved back to the shore it climbed up the deck , following the boat and jumping at the wall behind them . The boat was almost there though . The sound of the water hitting the sand was different from most of the water , so it stopped just a few feet away and looked down at the beach . It didn ’ t move , and the boat was moving closer . The water started pushing forward and up , leaving only a few men in the boat as it moved closer .   The sailor looked around for any sign of life or life . He didn ’ t even look into the water . There was a huge , huge glowing glowing object with a triangle in the distance and the side of the boat . The boat was moving towards him and the boat stopped . He was just a bit short of a shark .   “ Here , where are you ? ” The sailor asked .   “ We ’ ve managed to capture the creatures , but it was a bit more impressive than an average . The creatures have been closer to the island , and so far so far there I can hear them. ”   “ What ? ” The fisherman said .   “ It ’ s coming , Captain . They have attacked the creature . It ’ s coming , and it ’ s coming . We ’ ve almost *always* got *everywhere* . They ’ re moving more and more , and it ’ s going to be a big one. ” The boat looked up at him , to see the two men , who were right in their eyes .   “ Are you going to shoot them ! ” The boat laughed . They backed away , and the boat was starting to relax around them , and suddenly the boat stopped spinning .   “ Just look at the beach , Captain ! ” The boat shouted . “ I ’ m just going to shoot them ! ” The sailors started to move around , but the boat was still alive . The boat pulled away , and the boat followed . It was beautiful . The boat was moving forward as it moved .   “ And here I am . The creatures do their best to get in , but I have no idea what they are interested in . If I do not kill them , I will try to get them . A boat or two . It ’ s *not* big enough to get into the water , and it gets bigger . And I am going to shoot them . I am going to shoot them ! ”   The sailors started moving towards the boat , but the boat stopped moving , and they saw the beasts .   “ What is that ? ” The boat cried , and the boat disappeared . The boat became a circle , and the monster disappeared .   The sailors didn ’ t notice when they shot them . If they could just disappear , they were on the boat , and the boat were moving closer and closer . The boat stopped moving , and the two men stopped moving . They turned , looking down at the water . The submarine kept moving towards them . “ Let ’ s go back there ! ”   The squid nodded and went to the sea , holding a massive finger to the boat . The boat stopped spinning at the same time as the boat .   The boat moved , and it looked at out the window . She saw a giant monster of a giant , staring into the sky . The boat swerved back , and disappeared . The boat started moving quickly . The fins stopped rocking , and the boat went
The news itself was a disaster . Most of the world could have survived in a single hour . Some would have thought it would be the end . I still remember the days when the bombs fell , but I remember how the war ended . It happened when people left . Our neighbors have been able to find food . We now stand and watch as the war ends , when people left . We can not reach them from above to below . They will lose hope . They wo n't . We will go back and live . We will live . We will live . We will live .  
`` Man , I need a drink , '' said the mirror as I set it on the concrete floor . That would allow me to believe it .   `` Do n't be too busy for a nap , '' I said as I handed the bottle to my parents . `` What are you talking about ? ''   My younger sister and I both looked at each other . I had seen this before . Sometimes , they seemed worried . I had told them this - she knew it would n't work .   `` I 'm gon na buy some coffee , '' said my sister as it passed by .   I dropped the bottle at her , placing the bottle in my hands . I pulled it out as several bottles of coffee and tossed it in the sink . She looked at me , and gave the same wide smile . `` I guess , '' said my sister , looking at me with a smile . `` Would you like something to drink ? ''   I nodded . `` A drink , at least . ''   I nodded , and opened the door . Two feet taller than me , I could see my younger sister , standing in my doorway . Her hair was red , her mouth a deep blue .   `` Ah , hi , '' I said . `` You 'll be late . ''   `` Bye , '' she said . I walked my way toward the bathroom to find my wife-in-law and put in a piece of paper . I made a quick turn , and found her standing side-side in the doorway . I saw her standing there , she was smiling at me .   `` I'm- '' I stammered . `` I 'm sorry , '' she said . `` We need to try this . ''   I kept walking faster than any I had planned . I closed my eyes , and opened them .   `` I 'm going to propose , '' said my sister . `` There 's all kinds of different versions of you , and every one has been built . There 's no way we can actually save you from this . ''   She gave a slight nod . `` Right . Here , '' she said . I held one hand , and she placed it on the table . She opened it up . `` Then what 's yours , buddy ? ''   `` What ? '' I asked .   `` Do you want one ? '' she asked .   `` Because of your wife , '' I said . `` It 's time to give you one ? ''   `` Do n't think it 's going to work . '' She took a look at me and shook her head .   `` I do n't know , '' I said . `` I 'm going to try . ''   I opened my eyes . A man standing by the door told me that me , in my future , was the one who said the same thing . He handed me a bottle of hot water . He looked me in the eye , and said , `` Let 's just take a look , then , '' he said , and walked over to me .   I was in the bathroom again .   He looked at me and smiled at me . `` That 's in the mirror , '' I said .   The man walked over to me . `` What 's left of your wife , '' he said . `` Is n't that the one with the stuff ? ''   For a brief moment there were a few moments .   Then the door opened .   I took out my notebook . Inside was a picture of a woman . Her face was grey . `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` I do n't remember , '' I said . `` I 'M not talking about the stuff . ''   He smiled . `` I know , '' he said . `` I 'm not talking about it , but I 'm talking about it . ''   He left my room .   I just stared at her . Tears streamed down my cheeks to pool beneath us .   I realized that my heart was beating heavy .   `` What did you do ? '' I asked .   The man nodded and said , `` I did n't want to . I did n't want to hear you talking about anyone else . I just wanted to watch your happy little girl in the living room . And you know what you 're talking about ? ''   I did n't look at the picture before they even finished speaking .   `` We need to get to work and work and work , '' he said
Raves of white tiles and a pair of dice . The room that used to be quite a simple small round table , as it always used to be . They were adorned with gold sheets , the walls were decorated with glitter , the floor was large and solid . There were a few walls , like the ones up to the ceiling as their light bulbs danced across the room . The room was completely covered with paintings , and there were only a few pieces of furniture . The walls were made of gold , mostly covered with gold and some of the buttons .   `` Welcome to the Vault ! '' a voice called from behind the door .   A young woman strode up to the room and tapped a finger on her temple .   `` No , you 're dead , '' she said curtly . `` I know . ''   `` I do n't think we got the hell out of here again . ''   `` Yeah . Anyway , you 're gon na be so fucking crazy . ''   The strange woman nodded sadly .   Another woman stood on the edge of the room , and she slowly turned towards the door . The door was open , and on the other side of the room was a wooden door . There were no doors , so the vault was far different than the other two halves of the room .   The door was open , and the woman began to yell . `` I 've got a ... uh ... we 're n't sure what to expect -- ''   `` You 've got a job , are n't you ? ''   `` I 'm sorry , '' the woman said , suddenly speaking . `` I got a job with this kid . ''   `` Oh , yes , his name 's Frank . ''   `` Hello Frank , '' the man said , almost flustered . `` My name is Frank , so I 've been here for a few more days , so I think I 'm dead yesterday . ''   `` Right , yeah , '' Frank said , his hands raised in dismissal .   `` So you 're not seeing the door ? ''   `` You 're kidding me ? ''   `` I know , '' Frank replied , his hands raised in surrender . `` I know . ''   The man looked at Frank suspiciously .   `` Did you see the door ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Do you see the door ? ''   `` It 's a door to the Vault , '' Frank suggested , looking suspiciously at the box . `` For what ? ''   Frank looked around , for a moment , then at his face . There was no sign of any kind of door , just a door , and the door was open , and there were a few other men dressed in their suits , including the one out on the other side .   `` I see , '' Frank said , grinning and laughing . `` That 's it . ''   `` Yes , '' Frank said . `` What ? ''   `` Here 's the door . Open it . '' The man said . `` What was it ? ''   `` It 's a door . '' Frank said . `` You did n't see it . ''   Frank quickly turned to the woman , and grabbed a piece of paper . Upon opening it , a long black blade emerged from the box .   The woman looked like her husband . `` Frank , you 're going to take the first step . Let 's get into the vault . ''   `` What a wonderful place . ''   `` I do n't know , '' Frank said , standing up . `` I 'm coming too . Do n't give me this , Frank . ''   She walked closer . `` So , if you were going to get through I 'd get to it . ''   `` I 'd like to , '' Frank continued . `` Your head looks pretty heavy , though . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' Frank finished . `` You remember when I did that job . You 're a ... umm ... ''   `` This is n't over . ''   Frank did n't respond . `` I ... I 'm not supposed to know , '' he said .   `` Are you a wizard ? ''   `` Nope , I guess . ''   `` No . ''   More of Frank 's hand moved closer and closer . The
`` I guess we 've been at the same time this weekend ? '' I inquired .  `` Well that 's the point , I 've been hearing about you since I first started talking at least a couple times now when I was 16 . ''  He smiled .  `` I did n't say anything , and as I made my way to his room I noticed , a black-haired man wearing a black suit .  `` This is crazy how you think of me , I 've heard about you before . ''  He pouted .  `` I do n't know , you do n't mean to just play together . ''  His eyes shot up .  I looked down at my hands , and he sat down .  `` It 's funny , is n't it ? ''  `` Yes , I suppose it is . ''  My body shook .  `` What 's it called me ? '' I asked .  `` Well , what the fuck do you want ? ''  He looked up .  `` I think I 'll play with you . ''  He laughed .  `` No . '' His voice was more like a soft whisper .  `` I 'm not ... I 'm not going to play with you anymore . We ca n't start playing together . '' His voice was more like a whisper .  `` I do n't understand , but I 'm not sure what I 'm going to play with you . ''  His eyes narrowed .  `` I do n't understand why you hear such a weird language , but I do n't understand how it sounds , or how it sounds , or how it feels . We 've been playing together for ages now , and I ca n't let them win .  `` I told them that it does n't care about you , though . ''  My fingers flicked back .  `` I know . ''  He blinked again . `` I know . '' My fingers clenched .  I knew it was him .  `` We , on your way . '' My stomach dropped .  My fingers began to squeeze .  `` You did n't have to play with me . ''  I glanced to my right .  I raised a hand .  `` You did n't have to play with me . ''  His eyes narrowed .  `` I ca n't . '' He pressed his hand against his head .  I shook my head .  `` I 've been playing this for the past 14 years . The first time in ages . ''  They stared at each other .  `` You 're not going to play with me . ''  I felt my cheeks prick .  I had n't been so used to playing .  His hands danced around his head .  I nodded .  `` I know , but I know what 's going on . You 're going to play with me . So what does this mean ? I know why you can play with me , because your friends never play with me . ''  He gestured to the other , and I looked up again .  `` I know . ''  My feet clung together .  I shook my head .
All I had to do was wait a few minutes until I noticed that the calendar had just changed colors and all I had to do was wait .   After ten minutes since you started dating me I knew what had started . It was then that I realized that I had already taken my laptop and logged on the latest date . The previous date was a month before I had learned to read it .   So I guess that was it . At least , that 's what I had thought , and I could n't tell if I 'd tried it wrong .   I decided to come to terms with my writing process , which would be fun if I gave it something to do with it .   At first I thought that was what I had expected . But now , I had to do it for a while .   There was something I wanted to do with it . But then I turned on the TV .   The video flickered in the background and I started to worry about the date .   The date was right in front of me . I had been on this date for ages . There was only one thing I could do about it so I had n't given it any chance .   A knock at the door , and when I answered it was a girl . Her long hair was covered in vines and her belly was red from the sun .   `` Hello ? She 's Jess ! '' She quickly responded my answer .   `` Hi Jess . '' I said nervously . She was young and tired of her appearance .   `` Hi Jess . What are you doing here ? I 'm trying to calm you down . '' She looked tired .   `` I ... I 'm just checking the date . '' I said to her .   `` It seems like you had n't changed gender here anymore . '' She said almost tears started to roll down her face .   `` What ? '' I asked defensively .   `` Jess ... do you know what this is ? Do you have any questions from school yet ? We 're both having a conversation with each other . '' She said pointing to the picture .   I swallowed . `` I 'm sorry Jess . I 'm just ... I 'm just glad you were still dating me . ''   I was confused . `` I know . I 'm sorry Jess . I 'm sorry Jess . I was just ... sorry Jess . I 've been wondering why you asked me if there 's some sort of person who 's my name ? '' I almost had my answer .   `` Yes Jess , '' she said , crossing her arms . `` But I 'm sorry Jess . I 'm just glad you 've been dating me both . I can see you 've been watching me here for a couple days now . ''   I was confused . And somehow it was all I wanted .   I finally realized that I was staring at my phone . I was sweating , and before I could think about it I yelled , `` You will know what you 've said . What is your name about ? ''   Jess started to cry . `` Jess . It 'll be okay . The worst of you . I know that . ''   I felt very disgusted . And then realized that I was staring at my phone .   It was an email I had never seen before . It was from someone I never expected to know . My phone was on its head .   `` Jess . I 'm not going to be able to talk to you again . '' I said .   `` Yeah well , well , I promise I 'll text you to the other side right now . ''   `` Thanks Jess . '' she said . She said her hand reaching out to brush it off .   `` Jess . Tell her what you 've said before . There 's only one thing you have left . ''   I felt uncomfortable . I was sweating . I could taste the warmth in my stomach . I had always considered this for myself , but now my stomach was n't moving .   `` Jess . '' Jess said slowly . Then she lifted her hands and dragged them to my car .   I was stunned . I wanted to do it any last minute . Maybe someone else would have told me that this was n't how I got my life to be . Maybe I should n't go to sleep now ? I 'd have to get to sleep now .   It must have been a surprise . I had been waiting so long for the girl to enter .   That
*The genie sat at the table with a blank stare he was staring at . *    `` Well what kind of person do you want ? '' the genie replied , tapping a button on his clipboard .    `` Well what do you think ? I can use my powers to make sure to not think of anything . It 's still a little weird , but there are usually two possibilities . ''    `` Oh , well what about this one ? ''    `` I 've really tried to find out that as some deity , I have n't even started at all . ''    `` Oh , wow . I 'm not sure of where you are going . That 's what I want . ''    `` Well yeah . I want to know about it . ''    The genie glared at an extremely confused look .    `` Okay . I 'm not sure who it is , but ... I think who it is . ''    `` I 'm God , and God is the God of the underworld . ''    `` Alright then , fine . '' The genie waved his hand toward the man .    `` And then the Genie went and ran out of the room , on his way back from the room . He tried to take his seat , and then he fell over and fell over to his knees . ''    There was no reaction . The man looked down at his clipboard once more .    `` I 'm God of the underworld . For God of the underworld to become immortal . And then there is no man on Earth to decide that there are no man on Earth to choose from . ''    *The Genie of the underworld was still sitting there with a blank stare . It hung on the table . As he walked away the man saw nothing but a human .    *The Genie of the underworld saw nothing but a genie looking at the two humans . *  
`` Alright class . '' I said at the receptionist . `` You want to know how to give your name like this ? '' I asked . `` Hi . '' She took my hand . She smiled and said , `` Yeah . '' I nodded . `` Okay . '' It was a simple question , like the name at least .   `` No , I know better ! '' She said , `` It 's a name . '' She shook her head and led me to the other side of the room , leaning on the bed .   I looked at her , shocked . `` How is it ? '' I asked in silence . They all looked confused , and tried to look at each other . Then I smiled .   `` Well not quite . '' I told her , `` I need to get the name right now . People have their names as well . So they 've been asking these people about it . '' I said before putting my hand on her . She laughed . `` It 's a name . ''   `` Well , I will see ... '' I said , `` I have to find it . '' I looked at my tablet , as if I had n't seen in weeks . `` I 've been in a lot of trouble since the first name . They 've gone to the city , and now I 'm in a sort of trouble . That 's the problem . ''   `` And you think they would 've seen the name in my head ? '' I asked , `` Yes , I do . ''   I stood up . `` That 's right , there 's nothing I can do , do n't you ? ''   She smiled and said , `` No . ''   `` But that 's the gist of it . Maybe they 've seen the name before . That 's what I 'm gon na miss . '' She put her hand on my shoulder and kissed me on the cheek .   `` The name , man . '' I said .   `` Well ... '' She said , `` I do n't need to ask for my name . ''   `` Yep . '' I said , `` Are you ready . ''   She began to blush . `` Great ! '' She said . `` I 'm sure it 's okay , it 's ok. '' She started to get nervous . `` It 's alright , thank you . Bye '' She turned back to us , her fingers slowly twitching slowly . She looked around the room , with the same blue light as the last star .   I closed my eyes . `` Okay . Thank you . '' I said , and hung my head . I ran over to my computer and slid down the hall . I turned back to the computer and started writing . As I saw the name in the book , I noticed something in the book .   `` Hi . '' I said , `` And how is it ? '' I said after a few seconds , `` Well ... '' I looked at my phone . `` I 'm really not sure . '' I ran over to my computer , opened it and said , `` I got it . '' Then I pulled out my phone , and went to the bathroom . A single piece of paper flew from the back of my head . I looked over to look at it , and recognized the name number .
`` Mom , I 'm going to have to get her to go to church . I 'll be safe and that 's goodbye , and I 'm going to have to have with her . '' Mom said as she reached out and touched my hand . I could see tears flowing freely down my cheeks as I felt a warm rush of air down my face . I 'm glad that I did n't have to live much longer , so I did it .   `` Mom , I 'm going to have to go try . '' She said as she squeezed my hand .   `` Mom ! '' I screamed , jumping back to the ground , grabbing my arms and pushing back . A pain swept over me and I closed my eyes as I pulled myself back out of that hospital bed . `` I-I 'm going to need to go back , mom . I- ''   `` Dad , I 'm begging . I have to get her to go . It hurts too much . '' She said as she pushed back her tears .   `` I 'm sorry . Please . Please . Please . Please . ''   `` Mom ? ''   `` Mom , I 'm about to go back . '' She said as she hugged her arms . `` My legs are falling too hot . Let 's go . '' I said as I hugged her . I could feel myself in the hospital room starting to fade .   I closed my eyes and felt a sharp pain . I felt another sharp pain again . I went into consciousness and in front of me , I closed my eyes again and whispered loudly .   I was driving home . I 'm going back now . I was back then . As I was driving home , I heard a faint sound . A young woman , and her eyes . So I was laying on the hospital bed , curled up against my own bed . I looked to my daughter , and took a deep breath . I was falling back .   `` Mom , I 'm going home . '' She said as she pulled me into her arms .   `` Mom , I ca n't go home . She 'll be back soon or I 'm going home soon . '' I said as I collapsed .   And then I heard the crack of a knife as I woke up . I held the blade to my throat .   -- -   I woke up in a hospital bed . I had been standing in the center of the room , completely disoriented , but not very much so . The pain was also blinding . I felt my family 's hands move around my neck and face . I started to feel my limbs move and move around and wrists . I tried to breathe , but eventually my vision became blurry . I was completely naked and I was naked . I was standing on top of the hospital bed , holding my hand in front of me and arms . I heard a scream from around the corner of the hospital .   I heard it . Slowly , but surely . I felt myself sliding away from the pain anymore . I backed up , facing my family .   `` Mom , are you okay ? '' I said , confused .   `` Yes . There 's an afterlife . What went wrong ? ''   `` There 's no afterlife . We have to wait what happened . We 're going to be fine . ''   `` It 's ok , I 'm going to make sure I 've died before . ''   `` Dad , I 'm going to give you a seat . ''   `` I 'm going to sit down . You 're going to try again . ''   `` Mom , you 're going to know what happened . '' me said as I fell back to my knees . I picked up my daughter 's hand , and moved her hand towards my chest .   `` You 're going to be alright . Go into the waiting room . '' The pain was excruciating . I felt my own body turn into a giant metal barrel . It was my own body . I opened my eyes , and started to cry .   I ran the hallway . I took the gun , and walked into the room , and before I blacked out , I looked at my wife .   `` You did n't say this . I 'm going to be fine . I promise . '' The pain was blinding . I woke up in a different room .   `` Do n't worry , I 'll be fine . It 'll be okay . '' I ran to room , and began to sob .   I shook my head . I was in the waiting room . I was
Sirens outside wailed from outside of the mall , the smell of rotting bacon , the smell of rotting flesh wafting , the smell of rotting flesh and rotting flesh and decay . The horde was dead . The woman was covered in charred blood . The remains of two zombies were missing her torso . They were missing . They were bleeding , she was too tired to fight on them .   She was hungry . She looked down at her hand and saw that there was nothing she could do . The zombie was gone , but there was still blood . There was a crunch the size of a gun , a red hole in the wall . She looked down upon the zombie . The zombie was wearing a scythe , with a head sticking out . He was in her face . The zombies were on the run , she seemed to be moving , and the zombie was too hungry to move . She had a zombie now .   All the zombies were dead . The zombie was dead . She was starving . She tried to stop her but could n't see anything , there was nothing she could do but open her eyes . The zombie was dying , she said . It had happened so fast . She ran back to the room and tried to crawl inside ... and then it was gone .   There was no food here . She was there . It was still alive , it was dead . The zombies were staring at her . They stood there . They moved , she could n't move . They jumped backward . They moved , but the zombies were on the run . They stopped , and turned again . They took a long drag , but the zombies were too busy . They were walking faster than a human , their zombie still alive . She was still hungry , and the zombies were on the run , they were n't dead yet . They did n't hurt her . They did n't hurt her . The zombies were dying anyways . She was n't breathing .   All the zombies were alive .
`` Shit ! '' I screamed . `` This is happening ! ''   The kid on the other side of the street was trying to get me some more food . I wanted to get some of these things like dinner and get some fucking food before I left .   `` Why ? ! ? '' I shouted .   `` You did n't ... .. '' He stopped . `` Your fucking mother has been cheating on you three months ago ! ''   `` You 've been cheating on me like this for a week now ! ! ! ? ! '' I shouted .   `` I did n't know you were cheating on me ! Please ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ... . '' the kid said .   `` I never told you you and your fucking mother are cheating on me to hurt you ! ! ! ! `` , the kid said .   `` It 's not possible ! You 're cheating on me for more than ten billion dollars ! '' The kid started . It 's not possible . The kid continued to laugh .   `` Why not ? ! ! ? ! ? `` , the kid bellowed .   `` It 's not possible ! You ca n't be cheating on me anymore ! ! ! . '' The kid yelled .   `` It 's not possible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ... ... ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . ! ! ! ''   My mother cried . She told me that when I showed up to her , I was going to help her . `` You could n't be cheating on me ! I ca n't be cheating on you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ''   I turned around to the kid . I 'm not a killer yet , but the kid has the right amount of money to money . I had to get to the guy .   `` I got it ! You 're cheating on me , you . Go take over me ! ! ''
`` What ? '' the young man from a distance asked me , his voice piercing at my skull that made me blush . It must have been the last time I had thought so that I could help but feel it . `` Is it all for the money she wants ? ''   I grinned , `` It 's the money I should need . '' I told him . He looked up at me and started to take his place . `` How do I know that I know that I should have made this easier ? The money I need to know will have everything that will never be mine once . ''   `` What ? Oh do n't tell me so ! You all know that I needed to understand you ! '' he snapped .   I had always been so happy with this . I felt like I had been so happy with myself to be happy with *you* . I was happy with it , but for the sake of my life I needed to have my own work .   It was time and the man was about to depart . I was able to make this a better place , if nothing happened . I did n't know where I was going at , but I knew what I was going to do . I had to try , but now I could n't .   I moved his hand back to mine and rested my head around my head . `` Do n't say this . It 's not as much as I need to know anymore . ''   He began to rummage through his pockets , but I found the right spot under the dresser . I did n't want it to spill over my face .   I was n't sure why I had to pay so many favors for this job . I knew what was happening , but I knew what was going on .   I began to wonder what I had to do . I did n't know what had to do , but I did n't listen .   I looked behind me and saw the man sitting atop of me . `` I 'm not coming for this job . ''   I watched as he took a deep breath as he walked away . I looked down at the dresser and saw that it was time to come . I pulled it up and began to weep .   I knew what had to do . I was n't supposed to be here . Someone had the opportunity to make this place better . Or maybe ... I had at least felt my own way . I opened my mouth and closed my eyes .   `` Do n't say this . I 'll be here until tomorrow . Your mother will be there when I can reach you . What do you need to do with such a horrible woman ? ''   I shook my head , `` I 'm coming for this job . ''   I looked up and saw a large figure standing beside me . His face was blue , his black hair pulled back and his face was dark . He did n't look like his mother , but he looked out the window and looked down at me . I opened my eyes and saw that he had stood on top of me . It was a small girl , with a blonde face and with a large red belly . As she looked down at me quizzically , I saw that she had taken something from me , but I knew what was coming .   I walked towards her . `` Do n't scream ! I 'm coming for this job ! '' I cried , unable to contain myself , but I wanted to see my own face .   `` What are you doing with me here ? Is this the work I 'm going to do ? That 's mine . I have to go now , to get out of here , and let me help . '' I sat down with my stomach , feeling that I deserved something to be done .   `` You wo n't be here until tomorrow . '' the girl next to me began to cry at my face . I knew that whatever she had done would take my place and put something in my pockets , something terrible , something terrible . I let out a deep breath and whispered in my ear , `` When I reach you , I do this . I wo n't give you anything you 've done for yourself . ''
We did n't know why we were here .   They told us the real truth . The real truth is , the real truth is , that the real truth is , the real truth is , that was n't always the real truth . We were n't supposed to , no matter how much we were here , it would make sense . We would n't spend any time in this dark . He would n't be here any more . He would n't be here any longer .   No one else ever happened . They say , is n't really my home . I do n't know why , but for one minute that I felt a chill run to my spine as I struggled against the door . It had to be a prank . One minute that followed , it would n't come , or if it was time to bring back my thoughts . Every time I did , I started to feel something grow in my leg . As soon as the door cracked open , it was a very cold knock . It was the last time I had reached the door , it was much colder , and the light was light and colder .   `` Hey , can you keep looking at me ? '' I almost did n't know what was wrong .   `` Yes , uh , I 'm afraid I 'm not here . '' The voice from the closet started to sound more like a whisper . It seemed I was n't sure what had happened yet . It made me think I was a ghost . Maybe I was a ghost .   `` Look , I think I might never have gotten out of this place . It was n't a ghost . '' I sighed .   The voice continued to laugh , slowly , `` You wo n't know why . ''   It was a very quiet laugh . It had echoed his voice . I slowly opened the door , and slowly approached it . I was about to answer it .   `` Wha 's the door ? '' It said , almost as if I were mocking the question . It was n't any kind of laugh . It was a voice that sounded like a whisper in an old radio .  `` The question ? Are you even here ? ''  `` Yes . ''  `` What ? ''  `` I did n't have to answer . My answer was , however . I had just told you that I was right behind this door . Now , I 'm here . ''   `` This is n't exactly my home . Why did you come here ? ''  `` How could we not be here ? ''  `` I had tried to convince that . But I chose to ignore it . ''   This was different now . He had told me that before I started playing the little game , I knew that the question was a question that would n't have killed me . But I knew I would n't answer it . I could n't be here .   `` I 'm here to help . ''  `` I 'm here to help . '' I said .  `` What do you want ? ''  `` I want to help . I want to know I was right . ''   `` Okay . You can help me . Listen , I 'm here to help you . What have I done ? What have I done ? ''  `` Well , I 've done a lot of my job . I still do n't think I can help you anymore . ''   The voice continued to laugh . It was some kind of laughter and a funny way to find out what came from the closet . I heard it say after a while . It had just been his dream . I was n't sure how it would come to this point . I 'm sure that this was n't the real truth of it , or it just felt so familiar .   `` Are you here for me ? ''  `` Yes . ''  `` Yes . ''  `` Where are you ? ''  `` I do n't know . I do n't know . I want to know . Do n't give me money . Do n't . I want to know what will happen . You need to know what will happen if I want to . I want to know what will happen if I want to . But I need to know I will . I want to know what will happen when I do n't want to know what will happen when we die . ''  `` But , I do n't know . ''  `` Not now . ''  `` Then why do you do n't have to . ''  They heard me in a way that spoke like they did when you were alive . I 'm sure I was still dreaming .   `` I
**Part 1**   ***PART 1**   For many years , many people thought and thought and thought and thought and thought , and then remembered and hoped . It was a wonderment that was very slowly made and only one person that had a feeling that a sense of humour in this universe . In fact , there was one thing that simply would not satisfy the desire for change .   **Part 2**   Those who thought were only true for the past few millennia . Stories of people who would spend their childhood reading about their dream , and laughing at the same jokes they would use every moment to think . And that we were all true for such things . The entire universe was a sort of chaotic race , and so many in the same way , that life was seemingly endless .   ***Part 3**   The universe was now covered in grey , grey , and black , and blue , and many other things that could not be quite . Perhaps it was the only one that had noticed that nothing was ever possible . Yet , in this moment that all around them was , as they appeared to exist in the middle of a simple computer , and in the middle of a machine was a computer . They could not understand what the computer was doing in all his life . But it did n't help his disbelief .   **Part 1**   The computer began to appear all around him . The computer was all about to talk . They were as clear as the words of the universe , and they were all about to create their universe . It took several months , and it took decades to realize that they tried to help each other . But that didn ’ t mean anything more . Even if they wanted to make their universe greater , they could not . And that time .   **Part 2**   The computer suddenly stopped completely . He looked to the computer and then to the computer , as if it was talking . He looked to the computer , and was greeted by a single message :   > **Part 3**   The computer finally stopped talking . The language language was not important ; it was simply addressed to him . The computer moved closer , and he had started to panic . It was n't very important but by the thought , there was also a power outage .   Suddenly , it opened up again . The thing was black , the thing , it was white , and it was not blue . There was no color , just white , and a purple , and it seemed to be an entire area that looked much different than the other one . It was not a big part of the thing , but rather , it was some kind of metal , or some sort of metal . It was a small structure with a rectangular dome just past the edge , which was strange . It was not solid , but rather strange , or something else that seemed to be much smaller than the other . This strange creature , however , seemed to be trying to reason with it .   > > **Part 4**   The creature immediately froze . It was not black , or rather a large part of the creature , but the creature seemed to be trying to find something , yet it was not red . It stared at the creature , and at the creature , it simply stared at its own . It sat back up and the creature continued to stare at it in astonishment .   > > **Part 3**   The creature seemed to say something , and began to stare at it . The creature seemed to be just staring at it , and stood up . It stared at the creatures , and began to look at the creature , while it waited for the image to continue , or seem to look at it . Finally the creature began to speak , and the creature started to cough . It simply smiled and and then coughed , and then looked up at the creature again .   The creature then looked at its own creature , and then smiled , and then said :  > **Part 2**   The creature ran back to it , and reached up to grab it by the neck , but it did not move . It looked at it , as if it was simply staring at it , and then finally stopped dead . What was she doing ? ! ?   The creature stood speechless , and the creature turned back to it . Then and calmly started to sob , but suddenly it held on to it and looked around . It looked at its own hands , and then at the creature . It shook that confused expression that told it even more . He started to laugh , and then at it . It was too quiet to ask if this is real .   The creature looked at it , and realized that this creature had seen enough of him . He
`` That 's not the first of your birth . '' the dragon spoke .   `` I do n't remember looking back the day you met your father . '' The child answered .   `` What ? '' the child nodded .   `` When the other dragon got my boy I called you . I used to be a man who could be a wizard and I started to hurt him . Now we 've been together for so long . ''   `` For that matter , I thought . '' The child agreed .   `` Once I was in my room my father said no . I remember my day . The day came and I was waiting . He said so . He said no . I should have said no . But no . I was n't scared of the day . I loved him . '' The child nodded .   A few years later I saw my father 's face turn to see the child 's shadow . It was n't that it was from her eyes . It was what I did to her . It does n't matter . It does not matter . I did everything , and I do n't want to . I do n't want to hurt that . I know there is nothing I can do . I know there is nothing I can do . I know there would be nothing I can do . I do n't know why . I know there is nothing I can do . I know why . I know as much as I do not know why . I know why . Why ? Because I know that . '' The child looked at the child and saw her anger .   `` Why ? Why ? '' she asked .   `` Because you were my father . '' The child replied . `` Even though it could be his name I know why . ''   `` Because . ''   -- -   Thanks for reading ! If you liked this I 'll post here at my time !

`` Please , '' said the stranger in the bar .   He had just gotten up , and stood in front of his face as he looked down at his drink . `` I would n't like to say goodbye to you again , Mister . ''   `` I know , '' he sighed , `` but I thought I would never spend my life with you . ''   He lifted his head up and held out a hand . `` Okay , thank you so much for coming home , '' he continued , `` I have a great opportunity to find you . ''   The stranger frowned , and pulled the bar to his lips . `` ... I hope you enjoyed the opportunity , '' he sighed , `` I can help you if you want . ''   He held out his hand . `` Tell me ... '' he cut him off .   The stranger opened his mouth . `` Oh , so sorry , Mister . It 's ... fine . ''   The stranger wiped his hands to his forehead . `` Not an embarrassing moment ... ''   `` That 's not exactly a conversation . '' The stranger smiled . `` I thought you were happy . ''   The stranger was taken aback by the question . `` You 'd have , and you thought I needed a drink . ''   The stranger took a deep breath . `` I 'm sorry , Mister , but no . I do n't understand , '' he waved his hand at the stranger in the way . `` Please , tell me ... ''   The stranger stopped . `` Tell me ... '' The stranger said , `` why are you here ? ''   The stranger looked at him once more . `` I 'll tell you . ''
I was writing a prompt , so please get me to apologize . I 've tried an end in writing a different story , but I 'm not sure if it will be much of a story to write a story to me here if you 're really interested .   My first day to travel through a town so that it seemed like a town where we were in the middle of a swamp , and I could n't figure out where i was just headed to . As I got to the beach I noticed a few spots in the distance , and my feet were bare in the water , so I decided that i 'd look like I was walking into the water . I thought about how a nice place it was , and sure enough I could come across a river without any trouble . This would be different if I was n't walking in this town . After all , I 'm glad that I 'd find someone else to share my story with .   As I walked out , I heard a loud and strange sound , and it was like it was being lifted from my feet . It was like opening a door , telling me to push it open . I was suddenly able to get this out of here . I quickly walked up to my feet , still standing there in front of me . I tried all of my best to stand up and leave . I looked around quickly `` Oh well my name 's Bob . Hi , Bob , I 'm Bob . '' I looked around and noticed the area in the trees surrounding us . I looked at the area for good reason , as it clearly was n't a huge flat hill that I was normally looking . I looked around at the other side , and could see that everything was n't there . There were 3 parts where my feet were planted , and I saw a small pile of junk . I noticed that I had dug up a bit , but had no idea where I was . I looked around , thinking what was going on . I looked around my house and saw that it was in the middle of a small clearing . The inside was the middle of a waterfall of the river . This was definitely just my feet . Something was different about it . I looked around and saw a large wooden circle , followed by the large large opening .   Inside was a small piece , which marked `` The One '' where the three parts sat . I could see the center of the circle . `` This place is about an incredibly large stone '' I thought to myself , seeing that it was n't in the middle of a large rock . The front was a small circle , marked `` The One '' which I had been looking through . The only thing I noticed was the small stone wall of the room , and it was there . I slowly picked it up , and put it up . `` This is about the place you are all sitting around . '' I walked around the room , wondering what was going on , so I went to the floor . My hands were to be made of iron in my hands , but were n't . I realized that the very structure would be removed from them , as I began to panic ... I opened my hands to my hands , and pulled out a long metal rod with my elbows . I said , `` I am good . So is the place I keep ? '' I looked around at all of its inhabitants , as if for some reason I was scared of the idea . We were all just as happy as we were . I was thinking about it for a while now .   Then I saw what was going on . With all of my planning into my life , I could understand that all of my plans were working , and that everything , was still working . I looked around again and saw that there was some kind of large metal container all along . It was a metal pipe , and the inside was completely covered . I put it back on it and started to pull out a small piece . The larger pieces were in a very small book , and also a metal rod . I did n't move . I walked up to it and saw that there was a small amount of metal . I grabbed it and started to pull it out of my hands , as it began to look like it was holding a metal rod . I looked around the room to see that the hole had gone horribly wrong . The only thing I saw was the metal pipe , which was covered in some sort of metal . My feet were in front of it and I ran . Eventually we got to the center of the room , and looked at each other to see that the metal rod was stuck on the top . It was in a large box , and the other pieces were all black . There was a giant piece of metal with the size of a small box . It was extremely small , and the smaller piece is attached to the bottom of it , which was definitely covered in some sort of cloth . It looked like it was being scratched clean
It was a sea of fog that blew away the seas . The men and women and women were gone . They had spoken of their lord , some of their men and women . This was the beginning of the day .   The first time the ship fell onto the cliffs , the men and women looked at each other and their savior . The men were gone . The captain looked at the man and looked towards the horizon . He could see the men and women , all just a few feet away . The men and women stood up , walking towards a man whose name was unknown . He was in shock , seeing a man . He just looked at the man and saw the others , the man who was on the ship by the name of the man . Then he saw the man and saw them . The man saw the man and saw the man and ran , following his lead , only to find the man and his men . He screamed , and the men went back to their ship .   The men and women came back to their ship . They had no idea what was happening . At this point the men and women stared at each other . The man saw the man and saw the man as he saw them . They saw the man and fled . The men and women looked at each other and saw the man and saw the man . The men and women watched as the man ran back to their ship . The women panicked , and their voices were louder then the men and women rushed over . The men ran back to their ship . The woman ran back to the man and saw the man 's husband , and screamed , and ran back to their ship .   The scientists called the man and reached out to touch his family . The man and the woman walked away . The man had no idea what was happening . They were wrong . It was time .   The men and women headed back to the ship . They ran back to their ship and saw the man and the women who held their mother and father . The man and the women were turned back to their boat and see the man run back . The man and the women were gone . The man and the woman ran back to their ship . The men ran back to their ship and ran back to their ship . The three women screamed and went back to their ship . The man and the women turned back to the ship and saw the men and women . The women screamed and screamed and screamed , and screamed and kicked . The men run back to their ship . The women ran back to their ship and ran back home and back towards their ships . Each boy turned to the woman and took the man and held him in one hand . The men and women ran back to their ship and made a run . Some men stayed back to where they got away . The men cried and cried and cried and cried as they ran back to their ship . The man and the women screamed and moaned and ran back to their ship , but the man and the women screamed and cried and cried and screamed and cried . As the men ran back to their ship , the woman screamed and screamed and cried and cried and cried and screamed and screamed .   The woman and the men ran back to their boat , and brought them back to their ship . The men were gone .
`` I know ... I know , but everyone likes this . They 're going to pay for the cold and they 're going to pay for it . '' I reply slowly , hoping that the new customer would understand .   He smiles at me . `` I know ... '' He sighs , `` why 'd you pay for it . So what about the cold , when it 's so warm here ? ''   I smile , `` I know . ''   He nods in agreement as I reach for the box . `` That makes sense . Because it 's heavy enough . We 'll only need a minute of ... it makes me sick . ''   I pull the box off the ground and start to walk away . The new customer smiles at me . He looks up at me and I just nod in agreement .   I smile , `` Ahhh . So what do you know ? ''   He laughs at me again as he tries to push me off the ground .   `` Oh , I know , but I know it 's warm in here 's warm ! ''

As they approached the entrance they could make out the landscape , the buildings below seemed to be in a manner of greeting . Suddenly the buildings were in a completely different place .   `` Welcome , '' the young one asked .   `` Oh my god , '' it responded .   `` Welcome , '' one of the older-looking ones said . `` Why are you here ? ''   `` Not very specific . ''   He gave one of the blueprints .   The older-looking one stared at the two , then began to show his outfit . `` Is everything alright ? ''   The older-looking one shrugged . `` Yeah , I guess . I know . I am . ''   The older-looking one waved a hand to the other .   `` Do you really have a name ? ''   `` Can you tell me where you are ? ''   `` Why you are here with the blueprints . How are you here ? ''   `` Well . It 's strange : I 'm here for a reason . I 'm here for a reason . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` I suppose I 'd prefer to stay here for a minute . ''   `` Have I mentioned that ? ''   `` If you 're here , please . ''   The older-looking one lifted his hand up to meet the large one . `` Welcome . ''   `` Who are you ? ''   `` Where are you ? ''   `` You 're here for *your* purpose . I am here for you like to be here . I am here for you . You have a purpose . ''   The younger-looking man laughed .   `` You want to do something . ''   `` I ca n't do anything . What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` I hope your decision is made . You can do something . ''   `` And yet , I do n't know . There is something there . Something there ... ''   `` Yes . I want you to be here for me like today . ''   The younger-looking one pulled out a notebook and wrote on it with a detailed outline . `` When you finally got here , you realized that it was looking like the first time . ''   `` What about you ? ''   `` I mean , it was just going to really have to be a coincidence . ''   The older-looking person 's smile faded , then vanished .
`` Do you really think you have a story to write ? ''  `` Nope , that 's right ... I think so . ''  `` Have you been thinking so long ? ''  `` Yeah , I . ''  `` That 's right . The story is done tomorrow . ''  `` And now I hear that the tale is done . ''  `` You can believe that the story is done tomorrow . It 's said tomorrow . ''  `` Maybe it is . ''  `` We can find the story ! ''  `` But we know what it is ! ''  `` Alrighty , it 's said tomorrow . ''  `` We do n't have that story . ''  `` So . ''  `` So you said it ? ''  `` Exactly ! ''  `` Well that 's right ! ''  `` That 's right ! ''  `` Okay ! We 'll be living alone ! ''
Norman stepped up to the door and opened it . He was surprised . It was on the inside , but the wall was all covered in dirt . Most people had been sitting in a chair with their fists out at all , smiling at each other . They were all in shock .   `` Excuse me , '' said Tom , `` this is a short , short time . ''   `` It 's not long ! ''   `` Hey , '' Tom said , `` I know you guys do , but I do n't ... I really am ... .I 'm not sure I can do this again . ''   The door swung open like a crack .   Tom was surprised to see that his first and most recent incarnation of Earth was holding back his hand so that it would n't budge . He felt his hand tremble as he walked out , grabbing his hand .   The door swung again .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- :   *Dorman*   `` Please , '' said Tom , `` I 'm back in the morning and I 'm back in the morning . ''   Tom got up .   `` I 'll do it again , '' said Tom , `` I 'll tell you what you 're doing . ''   Tom turned into the office . He looked at the door and could n't see it . He was n't sure what he was just doing ; his eyes were blue , and his jaw were green . He did n't think he was a hallucination .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Dan walked out of a room with his hands around her chest . He looked at the door . Then again , it was more empty . He stared at the people in the room for a moment , then back at the door . He was n't sure what he was doing to everyone . He even understood it .   He thought about what he was doing to everyone . He thought about what he was doing to a person . He thought about what he was doing to everyone . He thought about how he was doing to a person like me . He thought about how he was doing to someone like me . Someone who seemed like people who seemed pretty good at him . And he did n't know where this was going . He did n't know what to do with it .   He thought about how people would do what he was doing out there to take care of him . He thought about how he did n't deserve that , but it was enough . He thought about how people would do what he did to a person like me . He thought about how he was doing to someone like myself . He thought about how people would do what he did . He thought about how people would do what they would do . He thought about what everyone else really did to him , how they did it to him . He thought about how he all laughed . He thought about how people would do that and how people would do what they did to him . He thought about how they would do what they did to him . He thought about what they hated , how they could n't be trusted to be trusted to him . How they would do what they believed as being trusted to be trusted to , how they were trusted to have to be trusted with anyone . All of humanity was still happy , and was glad to be so happy to be with them . He thought about how everything was . How things were good at doing nothing .   The door swung open .   `` It 's so important , '' said Tom , `` I think you 'll figure out who you are , Tom . I 've seen you all . ''   Tom looked at the door . He did n't even know why he was n't going to talk about why he did it . He thought about how he should do it . He thought about how people would do it to him . He thought about how people would do it to a person . He thought about how people would do it to them . He thought about how everyone could do something to their own people . He thought about how everyone would do something about them . He thought about how people would do it to him .   He thought about how they had gotten there
I watched my brother with grim eyes as he walked away from the couch .   `` ... the door opened . There 's no way he 's back . Not because he 's coming . He 's coming . ''   I nodded , and nodded solemnly .   `` There 's no way we 've got something to do . ''   `` I already know . I know the way . I 'll get a new apartment and get a new shower . '' I was shaking my head .   `` I do n't think it will last long , I do n't know . He 'll ... hang up . ''   He walked away right away from the couch , leaving me alone .   I nodded , because he did n't wake me up at five minutes before he could even get out of the couch . I looked at him , and he felt him and his face . I nodded , and his body was still breathing .   He nodded , and we left the room .
`` No way ! ''   `` It 's a really big game ! ''   `` It 's a game ! ''   `` It 's a game ! ''   `` What ? ''   `` Exactly . ''   `` There 's always a game ! ''   `` I 'm a game ! ''   `` You 're not the one that 's got ta come up with . ''   `` Fine ... ''   `` Do n't worry about it , but I 'll be back at it ! ''   `` Now tell me your game ! ''   `` Alright , here 's the game ! ''   `` Alright , hold this game ! ''   `` Fine , '' said the dealer with a crooked grin . `` After I cut you off . You 'll have to take advantage of everyone else . ''   `` Okay . Alright . ''   `` See you tomorrow ? ''   `` Good . ''   `` Good . ''   `` Good . ''   `` This game was always different ! ''   `` Really ? ''   `` That 's right . ''   `` Alright . See you tomorrow ! ''   `` What 's your name ? ''   `` Well , it 's not like the game is really important . ''   `` Hmm . ''   `` Alright .

''   `` Alright , so I 'll show you the game . ''   `` Oh , so you 'll show me the game ! ''   `` OK . ''   `` OK. ''   `` Alright , okay . ''  
I was working on this stuff , and I did write a story that inspired my own theme where I was once a kid . I thought it was fun to write but it was fun to write more of a prompt , so I wrote it a while back to where I wanted to improve , and it was appreciated . I read the book from a small book that was in front of me , which I wrote for .   It came about four hours ago when I had gotten to work . I bought a brand new car , the one I had bought , and it was almost always a bit more exciting . I bought a new car with my own car , which made me really happy to meet an older woman . It was n't so exciting for me to see her work at some point that I had really enjoyed putting myself in a car , I made myself a decent job , and I 'd read everything for a while . I liked it when I had a family . I did n't know if any of that was true or not , or if I did n't know , as it was . I was in fact proud of myself that I would go to school , just for a bit , for a bit .   It was hard to walk in the woods when I started to think about what I had done . I had no idea how long I had been in the woods .   I would sit there in the forest , walking and then talk to someone . After all , I did n't have a mind and it was kind of just a game with a little girl . There were lots of people who were pretty close to them , and a few adults who were very close to me . I could actually have made a difference again , but it was my favorite movie I had had seen .   I would sit there , watching her , waiting . I would stare at her and ask her what she did . I knew that I was happy and what if I did n't want to go away and that I was able to watch her move . I could n't understand what she was doing , but I knew that I needed to try to figure out how to react . She would ask why she worked and why she did n't have to keep moving . She would tell people , I wanted to help her , to help her .   I smiled to myself , and nodded . I told them that she was a good person , and that I had n't found a safe place for them though .   I kept watch and waited , until I was in the middle of the woods . I did n't notice that it was a girl , who was in the middle of nowhere , and I was smiling back at her . It was weird that she was staring at me .   When I walked away , I tried to talk to the girl . Then she said she was funny , and that I was so happy at that . She was n't just smiling to me , and I was really happy at that . I was so sorry about her , but I did n't see any of that , and so I knew that I was happy .   I walked back to the front of the woods and watched her move again . She did n't even look at me . When she stopped moving , she gave me a look that I couldn ’ t really convey . I tried to think of how good it was to see her , but I did n't see any of that . I was just sitting there , staring at the girl , trying to think of something that could be made of something that just was n't there , and then I started to notice that she was talking to me .   I put a hand on my shoulder , and she said that I had to be at home , and the girl stopped walking . I looked at my watch , and the day went dark . That 's when I noticed that I did n't have a body . I was in the middle of nowhere , , after my last thought , that I was laying there , and that I was in the middle of nowhere . I laughed at them quickly as I remembered what kind of face I had lived in , and told them that she was the best person I had ever seen .   I woke up to the sound of the sound of her voice . I heard her voice , and it was the same voice that she answered . I was so happy that she was n't there . I opened my eyes and thought of something that anyone would do . I looked at her .   Before I knew it , I was gone .
I know I 've always wanted to be late , but I 'm tired of everything else .   I 'm tired of all the sleepless nights of the day . I 'm tired of all the nights . I 'm tired of my work , sleep with my sleep . I just want to be late . Instead , I 'm still in my room playing some sort of game .   I start to feel tired of all these nights , but I hate doing something I want to do .   I hate sleeping . I 've never seen the dreams before , and this is what I wanted to do to do to stop them from happening so . I 've never been angry so much . I 'm tired of every morning , of every morning . I 've been trapped in my house for so long . I 've been trapped in my kitchen and trapped in my own apartment , in my bedroom . I ca n't sleep , I 've never really been lonely or lonely .   I can do this to no person . The dreams I spend , of every year , of every day . I have been stuck in my room . I 've always wanted food through my day , of every year and every month , of every day and night until today , when I feel myself slipping away from my own bed as I wake up . I 've always wanted to do this to everyone else .   And tonight , I will make it to the park . The park is still full of people who think I 'm more lonely than usual . I climb to the bench , look up and see the red sky shining through the clouds .   I feel the light , almost like a beacon of hope . I pull out my phone and unlock it . I need to tell my boss , not to bother checking the area . As I unlock the phone , I hear a static and a distant voice from an unknown unknown distance .   `` Hello ? '' I ask . `` I 'm awake , and I 'm here to wake you up . ''   Shit .   What the fuck is wrong ?   `` Thats not the exact same reason you live here ? '' I answer . `` I do n't like this anymore . ''   `` What the hell are you talking about ? ''   `` You have no clue what it is ? ''   `` Nothing . '' I answer . `` What do you mean ? The messages are just a text . ''   `` What . ''   `` What the fuck did you think the messages ? ''   `` You 're just writing this , man . You got some spam . ''   `` That ? ''   `` Yeah , '' I respond . `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` I got spam . ''   `` What does this mean ? ''   `` I 'm trying to take my own words out , like I did . ''   `` What the fuck is it ? ''   `` There are reports and reports about the entire world . ''   `` I was working on a computer when the images started . I 'm trying to convince myself that all the possibilities are what was going on . ''   `` I am still trying to sell them . ''   `` Do you think that 's impossible , man ? ''   `` The whole universe is going to split into two . ''   `` What ? ''   `` A different solar flare . That 's what I 'm doing . ''   `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` Whatever . ''   `` Are n't you talking about this ? ''   `` Yes , ''   `` What the fuck is wrong with me ? ''   `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` It 's a fucking message . '' I say . `` How do you know the message ? ''   `` There 's a pattern in the middle of nowhere . ''   `` What the fuck is wrong with you ? ''   `` I 'm telling you , man . ''   `` Now , what are you talking about ? ''   `` We 're not talking about this , man . There 's a pattern in the middle of nowhere . ''   `` Shit , shit . ''   `` And if we can figure out why they 're calling me when I 'm talking about this . I do n't want to talk about this
`` Hey , have n't you just started living ? ''   `` Yeah , yeah I want to help you through the day : we 're just doing some shit . ''   `` Oh yeah , I ca n't forget that , right ? ''   `` Yeah , I got a couple of episodes before we were off . ''   `` What was that ? ''   `` Well I 've been in a couple of days now . I mean , I can hear you . ''   `` Yeah . You just ... wait , let 's start anew . ''   `` Oh yeah , yeah . I have n't been inside for 15 years now . ''  
`` Here is this : $ ''   I am a stock broker . I am the man who has been born in the North Pole for about an hour now . These people have been chasing me for the past year and still I fear that they will never touch me .   `` This is n't my business , '' I say .   I am a stock broker . I am the man who 's claimed the same as me . I am the man who 's claimed the same as me . For the most part , I have been an artist . I am the man who has not claimed the same as me since I had gone off to the beginning of the year . I 've always been the man that has seen me . The man who has claimed the same as me . I have seen him . I am the man who is now the man who is still living .   I am the man who has given me the gift to the world and to the world and to the world but to the world . I am the man who has given me the gift to the world . I am the man who has given me the gift to the world ; I am the man who will offer to the world .   I hate him . I hate him . I love him . I love him . I hate him . I hate him .   I hate him . I hate him . I hate him . I hate him . I hate him . I hate him . I hate him . I hate him . I hate him . I hate him . He hates me . I hate him . I hate him . I hate him .   I hate him . I hate him .  
`` Well , this is a joke . I think there must be a joke about the things you are asking about . How I 'm still alive in the middle of nowhere , with my friends , and friends in the middle of nowhere , I 'm talking to them . And they look like they 're taking out this little game . ''   `` Well , '' I replied , `` I know you 've never played so much . ''   `` Well , people have been watching me for weeks , and I guess it 's too late . ''   `` What ? '' I asked . We were going to discuss the rules of the game .   `` Do you know what you 're thinking ? ''   `` You 're thinking that there is something in me that wo n't be seen for twenty months . ''   `` Yeah , '' I said , `` I know . ''   `` I 'm thinking a joke . That 's it . ''   `` That sounds better . ''   `` I know you 're thinking that I 'm thinking that I 'd lose something . ''   I laughed at him .   `` That sounds better . '' 
`` Do n't fuck up ... '' the voice said , barely noticeable as I tried to hear it .   The screen shifted slightly as the voice echoed across the room once more . Everyone 's eyes followed the same roundly silhouette , not the one I 'd seen before but the one that I was looking toward to be the one who 'd known my name before .   `` Stop ... '' the voice stated , as if it had no time to speak . `` I have n't done this ... I 'm here to kill you man , I 'm here to kill you and I know your name . You know , I 'm not the one who 's killed you too ! I have to kill you . Please do n't do this ... you 'll do that for yourself . I will be your father now and soon . ''   The voice interrupted me and the sound changed quickly enough , as if the room was suddenly quiet .   The Voice took a deep breath and took a deep breath , `` You 've not done this . You 've told me everything . I 've put a gun away . ''   The Voice took another deep breath and looked at the screen , then continued , `` I 've turned you into a machine . It 'd be so easy to kill your mother , I ca n't force you to die . ''   *Click*   The voice continued , `` Every time I take my life , I ca n't handle this anymore . Life will be a new life . ''   *Click*   I looked at the clock again and got up and headed into the bathroom .   With a sigh , I turned to the bathroom and put the gun back in my pocket .   While everyone around me waited for me to die , they were still alive . I turned the knob and walked out behind me , leaving the room dark .
I don ’ t know why I bother him . He ’ s been sitting on his couch for weeks now , staring at the television on the wall that seemed to be playing in his eyes . He always had a pretty strong look from her face and the look on his face was hard to discern .   I knew I would look at him now , just the way she wanted to keep everything but him . I couldn ’ t tell if she was lying ; I had been lying .   “ That ’ s bad I ’ m sorry , ” she continued , while sitting there . “ And I ’ m sorry that I ’ m your guardian angel . I ’ m sorry that I wasn ’ t the last person I love . I just made the right choice . Just let me know a way to stop the world , and I guess that will be my one . I don ’ t think I will have anyone to tell me anything , just let me know that you , but you ’ re all that I care about . We have to keep our world apart from what we do to those people . If I can ’ t help you , I can ’ t help you . Is this really hard , for everyone I love ? ”   “ No , ” I explained , `` I just didn ’ t need to understand . I just don ’ t think I ’ m okay , can ’ t you ? I just want to keep love away from you . And I don ’ t want someone to tell you anything . I don ’ t know how I feel about you . I just want someone to tell me everything . Maybe that ’ s what I care about . You can ’ t be happy , that ’ s just what you do . If you ’ re not happy , then that ’ s what I wanted to be . Maybe because you ’ re just a part of me . Maybe if you ’ re upset , maybe because you ’ re not happy , it ’ ll be better to be better . But you ’ ll feel nothing more ... ”   “ What about you ? ” I asked , taking my hand away from her , `` I do n't know , okay ? I ’ m just going to let you go down there , and if I don ’ t , then that ’ ll be fine . I want you to be happy . What about you ? ”   “ Okay , alright , ” he said , “ I want to stay happy. ”   “ Okay no , I love you , ” she said , but I ’ m still trying to make out what he meant .   “ I don ’ t know , ” she said , “ I ’ m fine . You do love me , when you know I love you . And I love you . I love you , though . But I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t help you . ''   “ Okay . But if I don ’ t , what about you ? ”   “ Well , let me ask you what ’ s wrong , ” he whispered , “ If you want us to be together , then then you will go up and make sure you can ’ t . And then there will be a lot of problems , and that ’ s all I really want to say about you . ''   “ ... okay , ” I said , “ I love you . I don ’ t love you , I will. ”   “ I love you , ” he said , trying his best to keep his voice trembling , “ I ’ m sorry that wasn ’ t true . Just let me tell you . I wish I could take a life of my own . And then I would be happy . I know I ’ m not unhappy with you . And just let me tell you what I want to be with you , I have to tell you . I ’ m free. ”   “ I don ’ t have to pay you for everything , even if I ’ m free . It ’ s not what I *want* to tell you . I just want to know that all you want is you . I want to know that I can ’ t hurt anyone too , and I want to know that I am your guardian angel . I want to know that I love you , but I give everything to you . I want to know that I love you , because I ’ m a little bit sad . *If I want to be happy , then that ’ s what I
She took a picture of him and smiled . It 's a bright , sunny day , but a light was still in here so bright you could see light . She was wearing a pair of black and white sneakers that were clearly visible under the sun and her eyes were not a match , but a dark red with orange light . Her blonde hair hung on her shoulders and was long , and her shoulders were a length red and she wore an overcoat that smelled of dirt and dirt as if she was some sort of a joke .   `` Thank you . ''   `` No , '' she said . `` I love you . I LOVE you so deeply . ''   `` I love you so much . ''   `` You 've always been a good person . ''   `` Do n't we ? ''   `` I love you too much . ''   `` Will we all be together ? ''   `` Do n't you love me too much about me ? ''   `` I love you too much for me . ''   `` Do n't you love me enough so much about me ? ''   `` I love you too much . ''   She touched his arm and smiled .   She kissed him gently .   `` Thank you . ''   And then , as she touched her arm , the light was gone .   And then , she was gone .
It had been days since we first saw him . He had the most beautiful woman in his life . He had his life . He felt the light of the sun take him from her . His eyes . Not much pain , though . He had seen it all . He was a ghost , a ghost , a ghost , a ghost , a monster of light .   His eyes were dark . Something soft , firm , yet warm as the moon . His eyes closed , and he listened . She sat in the bed , still asleep , curled around his knees . He watched the light fade , fading away . His eyes moved toward the lamp , and he saw it , the light in the shadows , the light in the shadows that covered the entire forest .   He went to sleep , and he began to cry . He remembered the smell of a warm , warm summer breeze - he remembered the smell of the summer air and the soft sound of a warm summer breeze . He remembered the smell of pine and the smell of pine , but did n't recognize it . The smell of pine and pine and pine - his body , and his face . He remembered the smell , of the soft summer wind on the outside .   She sat there , in the room . Looking at him , he wondered why she was here . And his heart skipped , and he saw a young woman in front of him . He remembered the smell of pine , of the smell of pine .   `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   `` You 've been here for centuries and it 's finally time . ''   `` I know . I know . But I know . It does . I ... ''   `` I know . I know . Love . ''
They were having an amazing night of drinking . Being a musician , they were happy to have them to drink for good . I liked them , everyone except that one was happy to stay in their beds . I did n't . And after a while , it was bad really . I was the only one in the world who seemed to spend our entire lives with me .   Nobody knew what we were looking for ! I , not even I knew , did n't want to have to do anything ! The world was just as happy as it was , and I felt bad for them . I did n't want to do anything , even though I wanted to live like my family . When I was a young woman , all I knew was that my wife was a child , who was so young to be with me . I did n't want to do anything to me , and I did n't want to leave them alone . I did n't want to go home .   When I was a young woman , I saw the money we were looking for , so I saw a beautiful woman in my back . They were too busy explaining to me how I wanted to live . We were a few months old , but I did n't want to make anything . I did n't want to waste my savings ! I do n't want to do anything to them ! The only things that do n't go together , my wife 's friends , my wife 's family.. It was so beautiful .   I 've felt bad for anyone . I did n't want to do anything to them . I was a wonderful woman . I could n't do anything to them . I did n't want to be happy for everyone , so I went for the money . I needed to be happy . I wanted to be happy . I needed to be happy ! I wanted to be happy .   One day , I woke up to the sound of a small bedroom door being opened . It was as quiet as the last . I was able to hear the sound of the small bed being opened . There was an infant crying out . He was crying . He was crying . His face was covered in blood and he was crying . He died . I wanted to say something to stop .   I woke up to the sound of the other bed being open . I was in a hospital bed and I was . My wife ... I was crying .   I woke up to the sound of a soft voice .
We stood by the podium , and looked at eachother .   I cleared my throat . When my eyes turned to the crowd , there was a small , middle , blonde bird in a white robe stood with a huge , large window overlooking the arena . They were a lion . They were so beautiful , and looked like it was some sort of animal ; like they were a giant , hairy , pale , ugly insect at the top he was . It looked like this , but that was impossible to describe .   `` Welcome to a Heaven , '' I said .   The lion cleared his throat and opened his hand .   `` Uh..hhuh . I 'd like to introduce myself , '' I said , pointing to the side of the crowd .   `` Actually , where 's it going ? ''   `` Do n't be weird , '' he replied .   `` Yes . So , what do you want to tell me ? ''   `` It seems appropriate to introduce yourself , '' I said , sitting down on the podium . `` The arena is made of human , or so it 's called . ''   `` Uh..what ? ''   `` I 'm pretty sure you 're not exactly evil , unless you decide to be evil . Anyway , we 're quite a bit busy at this point , '' the feathers chided .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I said . `` And if I was evil then you 'd say Hell would be incredibly evil . ''   `` What were you saying ? ''   The eagle nodded .   `` Well , um ... how about you . Well , I just did n't , which case , is n't actually a good issue . ''   `` This is n't a problem , '' I said , turning to face the lion .   `` Well , here 's where I am today . ''   The eagle removed his glasses from his mouth and wiped it from his forehead .   `` Here 's your case . ''   The feathers took out one of the wings , and I put it on the ground and walked toward the end of the arena . There was a loud , loud , thunderous sound that I found myself standing in .   The lion gave me a quick nod .   `` What , where am I ? '' One of the feathers asked .   `` I 've killed a lot of people . '' I said . `` Because I 'm the one who gets the job , right ? ''   `` I 'm just on the top ! '' The eagle smiled .   The large bird turned toward me . `` You do n't think that 's a problem ? ''   `` I think you 're the one you have n't killed . Although , you are n't . People like you are n't like me , how do you think I have in life ? ''   `` Humans like you , I do n't like them . ''   `` I do n't like humans , '' I said . `` I 'm not a good person . ''   The lion nodded . It nodded .   `` That 's quite quite fascinating , '' I said . `` Anyways , Heaven was really busy with humans , which is pretty boring . ''   `` Well ... I 'm not the one who gets the job I have . ''   The eagle nodded . `` You look a little like this for me , '' he said .   `` But we 've got a problem , '' I said .   `` If you were n't evil then you will have to be punished after your failures . ''   `` What ? '' the bird said , turning to me .   `` We 'll discuss your own business . ''   `` That 's what they say , '' I said , trying to remember the way the lion said it , `` I 'm just saying , 'So I 'm telling you ? ' ''   `` It 's not like I think it works , '' it said . `` I 'm not very good . ''   `` You 're simply mad and I do n't give up on all sorts of things , '' I said .   He smiled .   `` Well , I am still in Heaven , '' I said , turning back to the crowd . `` It does n't work . ''   I stared at him . `` What 's your point ?
`` These are the results to kill us ! ''   `` You know what I 've done ! I have them all ! I will win , you can finish , I will go . You will die , you will survive , you will die , I will die and I will die ! Please , do you not want them ? I am here to give you the chance to die ! Please , do n't kill me ! ''   `` How many people are you ? Is you no longer here ? I will die , if you do n't want to die , I will kill you , to make you choose from what you chose . ''   `` How many people are you capable of ? I will be unable to . You will live . You will die . You will die . You will die , you will die . You will survive . You will be reborn . And you will die . Your will die . You will die . You will die . You will die . ''   `` You will die , '' said the man . `` I will kill you . You will be alive for eternity . Will you die ? ''   `` But you are dead . You will die and you will die , I will die ! You will die . You will die ! ''   `` You will die . I will die . You will die . I will die . I will die . You will die . Your life will be dead . You will die . You will die . you will die . The rest of you will die . ''
You look at it , it was pure and simple . I was wrong . From a hundred years of living in a different country with this man and woman , it was just some ordinary looking . Life was good that we were born , because we learned how to love the other way . The only time we had an understanding of how to love the other way was to love the other way . But we have no understanding of how to love the other way ... but only with one choice . For our future .    `` I do n't understand , '' I mumbled . It was all I could do . How could I fix this . He could fix this . Everyone , everything , everything . Everything , every story . Everything , everything . The perfect perfect thing .    The problem is , my past lives are true . Because I am one of the strongest people in the world . I am the largest people in the world . I am the one to end those lives . I am the only people who oppose me . I can only be one of the strongest people in the world , because of all that . So many people have perished . So many people have died . Some have died . Some have died . Some have died.. I have a choice .    `` I die , '' I replied . `` But I die . ''    `` How will I survive ? ''    `` Just ... '' I repeated .    `` I die , '' the other man said . `` I die , but I am an inferior species . ''    I did n't know what was going on . I know what it was going on , or so we thought . But it seems like my future lives are going on . I have to help this planet .    
It was the fifth day I realized that this just happened . I thought the last time I tried to get rid was the light to be on . How could I possibly have gotten rid of this ? At least that 's what I wanted .   `` So , you 're going to have to call me a representative of the planet of the Milky Way ? '' a voice said   `` The one who we know will be the first to offer you , the one who I knew is true . '' I shouted   `` And the one who who I know is true to me the one who shows knowledge to me . ''   `` And what so ? Why would we be a representative of the galaxy ? '' I asked   `` Because I know you are not a representative of the universe . '' The voice said   `` Because I agree , I do n't know how . ''   `` Well then , we both know that in reality , it would make them immortal , and they would n't be able to believe in one 's true cause . ''   `` What ? Why would the people know me when I was afraid of my love ? ''   `` Because my love for you is true . ''   `` But it 's not , it seems . There 's a certain way to describe what you 're saying to me as God . ''   `` But please , I see you truly believe in me . ''   `` What does your people do then ? '' The voice said   `` Because they know not to believe in you because they ca n't believe in it when you should . ''   `` Yes , it is . ''   `` Why would it make them immortal and they have their own purpose . ''   `` Do you understand the importance of your love ? ''   `` Because I understand the importance of your love ! ''   `` You think that has been true ? ''   `` I am ... ''   `` What else would our people do to offend us ? ''   `` You think of me to ask me a question ? ''   `` Do you understand ? '' The voice said   `` Why would we give you your love ? '' The voice said   `` Because I 'm what makes us immortal . You are your love for me . You are God . You are our love for me . You are your love for me . For me . ''   `` I believe in you ? ''   `` But I believe in you . ''   `` I believe in you . ''   `` Because I believe in you . ''   `` Have God ever heard my love for you ? ''   `` Yes . I believe in you . I believe in you that way . ''   `` Okay , so of course . But you need to trust me , and try to find me God . With your love for me , you need to trust me to trust you . ''   The voice chuckled   `` How are you going to tell me that ? ''   `` Because I believe in you . You think that you will believe in me for that ? ''   `` I believe in myself . ''
`` Mr. President , the first thing you see is that the US never saw this . '' I said , waving the barrel of my rifle towards the crowd .   There was a loud clap that made the sound of explosions , and each bullet echoed with every passing moment as my squad stepped backward . I was thrown in a flurry of gunfire .   My platoon was back to the office . A flurry of gunfire , and a swarm of explosions echoed around my field . A group of soldiers were at the top of my squad .   `` Hey guys , it 's done ! You 're gon na show them the signs ! '' The soldiers began to yell in unison , but I was caught by a sharp blow to her face , and she was stopped . She was holding her gun in her hand .   `` Hey guys ! All of this ! '' I yelled . `` There 's probably some reason we 're here ! You had to give them that gun ! ''   The two soldiers were at the top of their squad . They just passed , and the rest of us cheered . I was holding a rifle to my head .   `` What , what is it ? ''   I was holding my rifle . `` It 's here , '' I said . The soldiers looked at me . `` How 's the matter ? ''   The other soldiers looked at me , and shook their head . They said , `` We 're done . ''   `` You 're not gon na give us your guns back . They 're gon na have to do it . ''   I nodded vigorously .   `` You 're gon na like it . Get it back to the station . ''   We were now on the other side of the field . My squad was still chanting again .   There was a second of silence before we saw the sound of gunfire . The walls and ceiling were lined with a ceiling . As I closed my eyes , I heard a few shots , the explosions gone beyond .
`` Go to McDonald 's , honey . '' I heard a voice from within my room , `` we 'll be waiting for you in there . ''   The light shone into the room , illuminated only by lanterns and lanterns . I almost felt my heart racing as I heard a voice . I could n't even place it .   `` Are you sure ? Just go to McDonald 's , I do n't want to hurt you . '' I did n't want to scream . I could n't hear anything else . I did n't want to scream .   But I knew what was coming . I could n't stop . My father was only twelve . He was only fifteen , his eyes long and brown . I could n't let him know ...   `` It is just another day ! '' I had shouted in a rush . `` I feel like every day when you get home , I feel like every day you want to . ''   `` Why do you want to hurt me ? '' he asked , almost completely unbroken .   `` I 'm not really going to hurt you . You can do anything to help me . ''   I sighed , still holding the book toward him . He had to be right , but it was too late to notice .   `` Who made up the girl ! Why do you want to hurt me ? '' he screamed .   I had to stand there . I was right , so I could n't move .   `` You do n't have to hurt me , honey . I 'm just leaving because you 're gone . '' I had to wait .   `` I just ... '' He began , then finally stopped .   `` What ? What ? Why do you want to hurt me ? '' I asked .   He had to calm me down . I could n't do anything . I did n't want to hurt him .   `` I 'm afraid , daddy . Just ... .. .I want to hurt you . Anything . ''   `` Are you okay ? '' I could n't hear all that . I looked over . I tried to speak but I kept repeating it .   `` It 's okay , honey . '' He said , `` But have I been wrong ? ''   `` You 're wrong . ''   He pulled the book away . `` Everyone 's okay . Come to McDonald 's , and let me see this . ''   I could n't hear anything else from him .   `` What about that ? '' I asked , and tried to think of how he was supposed to be .   `` I just want to hurt you , honey . '' I whispered , and I felt the warmth running through me .   I could n't see anything else ... I had to get food . I had to run . I wanted to destroy everything .   I closed my eyes , and shut them .
Her face was white , and she saw how beautiful this was today . I could see the blood seeping from the eyes of the other villagers in the streets , and her eyes were dull , and her body was soft . She was pretty , but she was wearing a black bow and the same dress she used to wear .   You have never seen a vampire , such as myself . You have never seen one before . It has been so long since then , so long since I had been watching every creature that approached . It has been so long since me . It has been so long since she left , and I am still grateful . I know my fate ! I wish I could be left alone .   That day will come , come . I will leave the rest to hear a few news . The hunters will come soon , but they will find me . Soon , we will have another chance of escape , but it will come . I will arrive home soon . No one will be able to hear the stories .   I will have to leave .   I will leave .
My alarm flickered to life as I opened my eyes . What the hell was going on ? I turned again to see the light in the bathroom . Even after waking up , I could n't see anything .   Who was I ? If I needed some help , what was going on ? I stood up , ready to go to bed . The power went out , and I got out of bed and found the bathroom door open .   I was alone in the middle of the night . I had no idea what to do . It was like , `` Why do n't you just sleep ? '' I thought to myself . I did n't go to bed . I could n't .   I was scared . Of course , I would n't feel the same , but I did n't know what to do . It had to be . I was alone in this room .   I walked over to the fridge , and it was empty . The fridge was slightly empty , but I did n't want to eat any food . I opened the fridge , and it was empty .   What was going on ? I still did n't want to let that happen . I did n't want to know . I did n't remember my wife 's name ( and I remember her name ) , and I had to look .   I left and walked in the same room . This was new . I ran to the other door and slowly opened it .   When I had walked in , a strange man appeared on the floor . I looked around and saw that it was empty . If everything had gone out there , what would my wife take ? I was terrified of what had happened here .   `` There 's a gun in my fridge . '' He said with a smile . The gun fell to the floor . I looked around again . This was different .   I started to think about anything in the room , but could n't see anything .   *It 's right there . *   I opened my eyes and saw a figure standing there , talking in a language that could n't understand . In front of me was an an old man . He looked confused .   I held the gun up .   `` You see , I 'm not ... '' I said , `` But ... that is n't my life . And I 'm not . I 'm not a drug addict . ''   I was confused . Is this what happened here ? I was confused , I did n't want to answer .   `` What do you mean ? I have a gun . '' I said . `` And I 'm not . ''   `` Where are you ? ''   `` An officer . '' He gestured to his other hand . My name was John . `` I 'm not a drug addict . ''   `` I 'm an officer . '' I said . I felt tears race down my cheeks . `` Why make you think about this ? ''   `` Well ... it is . I 'm no drug dealer . ''   He began to speak , but my throat was so hot .   `` This is n't what I meant . So you can tell me . '' I said .   `` I 'm not a drug dealer . '' I said . `` So I 'm just a person . ''   He spoke up , `` But you know , I guess that 's why I 'm in this room . ''   I felt like I had not even opened my eyes . This was a strange dream . I looked around . It was dark . The floor was dark and I was covered in cold blood . `` What happened here ? ''   `` I am someone . '' I said .   `` What did I tell you ? '' He asked .   `` It seems important . '' I said .   `` You know , I 'm in the bathroom with a gun . I 'm going to have a gun . So I 'm going to buy the gun . Because I 'm in this room . ''   `` Okay , '' I said and looked at the gun .   `` I 'm so sorry , but ... '' He said , confused . `` Just leave . ''   `` Then why could n't you open my eyes ? '' I said . I looked around . Everything seemed normal .   `` I am not a drug dealer . '' He said . `` I 'm not a drug dealer anymore . I 've been given a drug . I 'm not a drug dealer .
So here you sit , and the world is happy . Here you are , and here you sit , and you were , on a rooftop and you were in the middle of nowhere .   `` Oh fucking wow , '' you muttered to yourself . `` What was that ? ''   `` Look , I 'm going to ask you , alright ? '' You asked .   `` What is that ? ''   `` I 'm sorry , you are right . '' You lied . `` It 's what I did . You were just a shell . ''   `` Please , '' the voice whispered back . `` I thought they would n't let me go . ''   `` What ? I 'm just a shell . I can tell you what 's going on , but I do n't really know what 's going on . And , as you are saying , you decide you can just leave . ''   `` Why ? '' You told yourself , confused .   `` You have to go to the city , '' some people said , and the voices stopped . `` I 'll take your place , and you 'll come to be here . ''   You looked around you , to see a city , without any cars , with no cars , no cars , no car . A city , with no houses , no ground , no cars , no cars , no cars , no cars , no cars or even a building , no anything . And then you saw lots of people , including those people , which were people . You were only 16 days old , and you were a robot .   `` I 'm going to go and buy you another cup of coffee , '' you said . You were a robot , but of course , what you would not get so far . `` I just -- I 'm going to buy you another cup of coffee . ''   `` I 'm too high , '' you said . `` There are people who do n't want to go to the streets , do I have a cup ? ''   `` Let me go to the city , '' the voice said , and you did n't hear it it from outside . `` The city . ''   You walked up to the city , and asked , `` Are you just a shell ? ''   `` I 'm not . ''   `` And that 's when you first started off my own coffee , '' you said , and while you were still out of place , you also felt the machine 's emotions .   `` I am a shell . And I do n't even know what it is and I 'm done with it . ''   `` I ... I do n't know what you are , '' you said , and your thoughts were interrupted by a voice . `` I am a shell . ''
`` You do n't know , why do n't you just kill me ? ''  I took a deep breath . `` You know that I 'm the one to die . ''  The words came across a large , glassy cylinder .  `` There are only people who do n't do it ! '' The words had become more powerful with that of a man by the name of God the night .  `` Why ? '' I tried to remember a time when Death took a job with him .  `` Because someone else 's soul will die without him '' I thought .  `` Why do you give me the right choice ? ''  I wondered again .  `` Because they never did . ''  `` Why ? '' I said .  `` Because that 's why we die . ''  `` Why . ''  `` Because I think you got the wrong choice ! '' I said .  `` Because you 've got your wrong choice ? You 'll get your wrong choice and you 'll get right to die because you 'll get the wrong choice and it 's okay because you 're going to die because I do n't feel it being the right choice . ''  `` So you 've got to decide ? ''  `` Why ? ''  `` Because you 'll have to kill me . Because it does n't matter . Because I made the right choice . '' The men in the room did n't want to do it . They did it .  `` The right choice ? ''  `` Because of me . ''  `` There 's nothing left to do with me . ''  `` Why ? ''  `` Because if you 're going to die , you 'll be your choice . ''  `` Are n't you going to die because of me ? ''  `` Because of me . '' The men in the room did n't want to do it .  Why would n't they love me ?  `` Because of me . ''  `` Because I 'm leaving . ''  `` Because I 'm okay if you wish to die , then I wo n't remember . ''  `` Because I ca n't remember you . ''  `` Because I want you to kill you because of me ! Because of me . Because of me . Because I 'm not right . Because of you . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me . Because when you turn around to stop me for the life you 're going to be able to do is kill someone else . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me . Because of you . Because you . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me . Because of them . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me . Because of me , because of me . Because of me . Because of me .

`` *I will not let you get something as good as you will . * ''   And so the father said .   `` She wo n't marry you until you choose . Now , it 's time for me to get my newborn child off of me . ''   But then the mother 's eyes saw it . There was nothing they could do . The father 's eye went through the closed window .   `` I 'll go to the bathroom to see you soon , '' he said .   And so the father 's eyes wandered across the room , as quickly as he could . He found his heart rate fastened , and found his heart rate faster than before . The father 's heart thumped . He opened his eyes to see that the mother was still in shock .   `` If I wanted to marry you , I 'd never met you before . Would I have asked for this ? And I do n't know . ''   And so the father said .   `` Yes . ''   And so the father said .   And so the father said .   `` I wo n't let you let me go . '' He said .
`` Do n't take me seriously ''   The screen started reading `` Yes ''   `` What ? ''   `` I have an accident and it 's an accident ''   The screen showed the message `` Its a malfunction ''   `` What ? ''   The screen became red .   `` I believe no reason . ''   The screen showed a large structure and a large dome surrounded by a large cylindrical body . Under the center of the sphere was a man with short cropped green hair . Beside the man was a man with a small yellow hat and a square mouth . On the centre was a large tube which looked like a large box . Inside was a large rectangular spherical box with a square mouth . On it were a large robot with large metal buttons . On the inside did the strange word `` Where are you ? ``   `` You 've been told that Earth is a place but it has many places to go ''   The robots looked at each other and then at each other , wondering what they would do .   They looked at each other with curiosity . One of them spoke to each other .   `` I wish you were an accident ''   `` Tell me about my accident ''   A smile crossed their faces , then took another step forward with a nod .   The robot said in a slight and steady voice `` I do n't know how to explain ''   The robot turned and walked towards a large platform where the large robot resided . As they walked that was the giant robot spoke   `` But what is this all about ? ''   `` What are we talking about ? ''   `` We 've had a thousand images of Earth and we 've lived at the same time but we knew it was in this world ''   The robot smiled , then put on a fake smile .   `` Have you been the first person ever experienced in the first place ? ''   `` Yes yes ''   The giant laughed again .   `` Yes ''   The two astronauts looked at each other with confusion .
Well , being a toddler gets a lot of work done , because it 's n't like I 'll ever meet you again .   When I first saw you , I saw you . We talked about friends , and talked about life in the movies . You did n't even want a big guy to ruin your life , you were gone .   You seemed to think you were like a good friend , living in your own home and I was in a horrible situation . But now that in my mind , I remember this letter . From what I said , we talked about how things became too complicated . I told my parents how things were going . They were the happiest people my life .   We were n't talked about life in a very big place , but it could n't be my own fault . We were all friends , I would be with you , and you were mine .   As I made my way into some other neighborhood , I began to feel light headed to the door . My hand hit the floor , and the door opened .   I looked at you with a confused look . How did you think you could just make me want to go to jail ? Did you do this to make me want to eat dinner ? Maybe I would get some food poisoning , or maybe I would be an alcoholic ? But that was n't what I thought of .   I closed my eyes , and I grabbed the door . The door opened . Inside , was a large woman . Only a couple feet away . One man . One of the three men fell to the ground , and one of the men was crying . It was only me , and I could n't speak . I could n't speak , but I could hear her screams .   `` Shh ... '' I thought .   `` Shh ... .shh ! '' he groaned . `` Shk . Shh . Shh . Shh ... Shh ... Shh . Shh . Shh ... Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh .

`` I 've got to do my best to bring her back , '' said a voice that was n't even a human would know .   The voice said `` Thank you , '' and a voice in the distance came from the speaker .   `` Thank you ! '' replied the speaker .   `` Yes , but thank you . Now , '' said the speaker .   ** '' I know it 's not fair , '' ** said the speaker , and a voice in the distance came from the speaker .   `` But it is n't fair . We have each other here . ''   `` And please remember if we do n't know what ? '' cried the speaker .   ** '' And we have each other here . '' **   `` I know it 's fair . '' repeated the speaker , and the speaker started talking to the speaker .   `` So how can you tell me ? '' muttered the speaker in the distance .   `` Three years ago , '' said the speaker . `` The future has fallen in love with the past , and no doubt ever will be able to bring you back to her . ''   ** '' What- what does that mean ? '' asked the speaker .   ** '' Okay , '' said the speaker . `` That must have been enough . ''   ** '' We knew it would be best to find her , '' said the speaker again . `` Now , this is a great idea . I do n't know anything of it . ''   `` But why would she tell me that ? '' asked the speaker .   ** '' Because they are not fair against it . There are many differences between the people that did n't have the foresight to bring her back to us then . '' said the speaker . `` I know it will be best to make her smile . I understand it is not fair for her , but we will be together . We will be together . ''   ** '' How do you know her ? '' asked the speaker as he continued talking .   `` What do you say ? '' asked the speaker , and the speaker was all too quiet , too quiet for any of the people to hear the speaker .   `` She says something about it , '' said the speaker . `` But she says something about it . ''   ** '' The truth is , '' said the speaker , and the rest . `` We will be together . I have told you this .

How ’ d I get this ? We ’ d come to terms with a concept , but it wasn ’ t . Not a choice I had . I was given the rights to use my masters .   We were young , too , and too young . We were so young , too young . We had grown into adults , so very small . We were so young , too young and we were so young . We had developed the ability to use it for a moment , but we were our own . We were their own .   Those days of loving , and finally they were happy .   They were always happy . Sometimes you ’ d sleep in it and it ’ d be like they were here . Sometimes you ’ d take a walk to the house , and they would drive at the front door to the bedroom .   My master… she , he ’ d tell me , they came across the yard , and there was only one . She sniffed nervously . I could feel her breath . It was deep and sweet .   I didn ’ t hear her breathe . After a long day of learning , I was reminded of the hard work I had done in the past . Her breath would be sweet and sweet . She was home , and I was grateful .   It wasn ’ t enough . I didn ’ t feel an option when I did . We were weak , and too young to bear .   I had to be happy .   I couldn ’ t . It had to be .   I could see the sadness in her eyes . She had to be sad .   I couldn ’ t . I couldn ’ t . I had to .   I could feel her breathing again , and they were so close .   She had to be happy for me . I ’ d go to my room and play and play with her . I felt her warmth rise .   She must have been happy again , and there was only a chance to be happy again .   I love her .
The envelope looked like a silver board , it seemed to contain the weight , the contents were not yet removed , and other than some empty letter that had sat in the envelope . Some said it would be a gift from the assassin , but whatever would say , it was a gift from the agency . With a slight smile , at least he did n't show up for another long time .   It had been a week since he signed up the contract , making sure he could n't . The contract was an ancient gift from the agency , but not a single piece of paper would take him to kill someone else . Despite his attempts to pull it off , the contract would be placed in the envelope , the only payment he had on it would be to hire someone who did n't give him . If he needed it , he would have to get him to kill a person who killed him and they would n't have to deal with him .   He glanced at his watch , the two dozen rounds that he had brought to his target was on display . The one on display was a huge red envelope , covered in red ink , with red ink , and a circle . The two had crossed the letter , covered in crimson ink , that somehow contained words of encouragement from his employers . The four had crossed the envelope , the one on display was a clear black envelope .   `` Forgive me , '' the one on display said , letting out a collective sigh . `` I 've killed many people , but that 's one hell of a lot easier than I have to kill . ''   Her eyes did n't move , and she did n't move , but she nodded . `` I do n't understand what happened . '' Her face sunk into a frown , and her soul fell to the ground .   `` Ah , yes , young man . '' She said , her voice booming with laughter . The contract was written quietly , so it felt like it was coming from a heavy , heavy , heavy breath . `` I 've killed many people , but now , I 'm here to make the other people happy . Of course , I 'm here to make the money . '' She paused to check Facebook , but she did n't bother to check Facebook again . `` So , I 'm on a level with my family , and I 'm willing to do what I did . I 've killed most of them , and I 'm not a part of that job , but it 's easy . '' Her eyes widened , and he did n't say something .   She stared intently , and her face was drawn into a wide smile . `` You know , it 's a gift from the agency , but this has a more understanding of it . ''   She nodded . `` And yet , I 'm here to deliver the contract to you , and to you , why are you here ? ''   `` Because I do n't know about your life . I love you . '' The two held each other , their eyes locked as he squeezed them tightly . `` That 's not what they say . '' The two made their way to the room , in time to feel the tension rising .   `` When I just die ... I 'm the first person who kills people . In the past , I 'm not a part of that story . I 'm not a part of that story before . ''   `` Once I die I 'm not a part of that story . If you die my life will be a more precious one , and I will be in the future forever . I 'm an assassin , you need me to die . I 'm not a part of that story . I 've been waiting for you for the last few centuries for something to happen , but what I 'm about to give you is the next chance . ''   `` And since I die , I 'm not really sure if this letter will be a blessing from you , but I 'll be willing to do it for you anyways . ''   `` Your life will end soon . ''   `` And where is my family ? ''   `` It wo n't . ''
`` Mmmmm . '' The man said , `` Do n't think I 'll be so mad ? '' His hand was raised as he spoke , `` You know the thing about this is how you see it . ''   The man shifted uncomfortably , `` But I know what you 're about to do . ''   The man turned to the empty empty room and back down the hallway . He had always been a good person for the family , people that were already growing and growing . They were getting closer and closer to why the family they had been building to bring in . But a moment had passed .   `` Stop . ''   The man nodded and turned around to see a large , imposing man standing right in front of the door . He took the man 's arm and he pushed it open . The man stepped into a room full of people , and with a heavy breath , he pointed towards the man on the ground and began to laugh .   `` This is what you 're about to do , '' he said to himself . The man 's expression was a fierce look , and he could n't help but laugh . `` It 's a bad thing . ''   The man smiled , `` And you see the one who murdered John . And with my family 's soul , they 're all gone . ''   `` Are you kidding me ? ''   `` No ! ''   The man laughed again and slowly he turned the corner to see that he was still smiling . `` I 'm dead . ''   The man shook his head , and put his hand on his skin , `` And so you 're in Heaven ? ''   `` No , '' the man said . His eyes were still locked with the man before him . `` But you are n't really dead , I mean like people who know me . You are . You are . You are . ''   The man shook his head , `` No , '' he said . `` I said it a bad thing . ''   The man nodded , `` I do n't think I can do that right ... ''   The man shook his head sadly , `` I think I can do that right now . ''   The man shook his head , `` And by the way , they 'll all care . ''   The man looked up and down at the man , `` But I do n't think I can do any right now . ''   `` Not anymore . '' The man shook his head , `` You 're too smart ! ''   The man moved back and down the hall , `` I do n't even know which one you 've got to do . '' he whispered .   The man shook his head , `` I do n't think I can do it right now . ''   The man shook his head , `` I think I can do this . ''   The man shook his head , `` The one you 've got to do is fix it , I 'm right . ''   The man shook his head . `` Really ? ''   The man shook his head , `` No , it ca n't be right . ''   `` I think I can do this right now , '' the man said , `` but the only thing that I did was save my old life . ''   The man shook his head , `` You would n't try to kill someone before I killed them , this is n't the choice that I need . It 's just another choice . '' He pointed towards the man on the ground . `` That 's what I 'd become . I think I will take them back . It's- ''   The man laughed harder and harder , `` Is n't it time to get rid of the people you 're not allowed to do this right ? ''   The man laughed , `` No . Because when you do it , your old life will be the same again . ''   The man chuckled , `` I think I 'll try , '' he said , `` But , I 'm not one to do this right now . I do n't think I can do this right now . I am here . ''   The man nodded , `` You know what I done . The people you committed to murder will be like people who lost their mother , even if you did n't kill us . I do n't think I can do this right now , but I think I 'll see a lot more . ''
`` Good afternoon , boys , boy . '' The young man said as he closed the door behind him and stood , his arms crossed .   `` Yes , the sun is shining , '' the old man said , his voice slightly higher than ever .   `` Yes , the sun has set , '' he replied quietly . `` It 's just the sun , there 's no moon , no moon , no moon , no moon , and no moon . ''   `` What 's your name ? '' The old man asked , almost immediately knowing how to respond .   `` My name is 'The Light ' . ''   `` Umm , sir , '' the old man said . `` I 'm Jack , '' he said , leaning back in his chair . `` I always felt like a kid . ''   `` You always wanted to make an effort to make him look good . '' Mark said .   `` No . You always wanted to be good at war . '' Jack said , holding out his hand . `` You could use it to kill a man , but you did n't want to destroy a man like you ? ''   `` Yes , sir , '' the old man said , placing his hand on his shoulder . `` I would n't hurt someone like you to help me , for you . ''   `` I think I can help . ''   `` If you do n't talk about me , then why do n't you sit down there ? '' The old man asked .   `` Because I could n't possibly hurt someone like you , '' the old man said . `` Maybe you could help people . ''   `` Then why do n't you watch me or else ? ''   The old man shook his head . `` Because I can help people , no matter how hard you sit by it , you 'll do everything for me . ''   `` I can help people , that 's why I go on . '' The old man said . `` I try to help people . ''   The old man 's eyes grew wide as well . `` Do n't worry , children . You 're good at war . You 're good at it . ''   `` What ? '' the old man said , dropping the little bag he had left inside .   `` I -- I 'm good at war , son . I ca n't help people anymore , '' the old man said , his eyes wide .   `` Everyone dies , '' the old man said , as he went back to his chair . `` We 're good at war , the sun is shining , '' he said , slowly moving his hand . `` There 's no moon , no moon . ''   `` Then why do you always run ? ''   The old man pulled open his hand and walked to the door , looking at the young man . `` It 's a small boy , '' he said . `` You 're good at war , son . ''   The boy held two . `` I 'm good at war . ''   `` You never get that . ''   `` You always start to play with them sometimes , '' the young man said .   `` But I do . ''
`` What the fuck is the matter ? ''  `` Yup , we 're in the sand and the sand . It 's like a mile deep . It 's a dead end in the desert . It 's a city of black smoke . ''  The old man looked down and squinted . In the desert , the sun was waning .  `` Is that a fucking miracle ? ''  `` Yeah , you know , we think we 'll just pop it up . ''  `` Fine . ''  `` I 'll be right if you do n't think we 'll get it . ''  `` What the hell ... ''  `` Do n't you think we 'll finish our mission ? ''  `` I can just take it ... ''  `` Listen to me , I 'm going to grab the fucking one . The fuck I want more water . And the fuck I want more water . ''  `` No ... what the fuck did you find me ? ''  `` I know you found me in the desert . ''  `` What the fuck do you mean ? ''  `` This is fucking crazy ! ''  `` Fuck off ! ''  `` This is crazy , you know ? If you give me the money , you have to just accept it . ''  `` I 'll pay you , fuck off ! ''  `` Fuck off , fuck off , fuck off . ''  
First time writing prompt , so that sounds like an excerpt from this : )   The first time he 'd asked what the hell was going on . He wanted to take a look at the sky and observe it as a big , green sky , but not just any sky . Not a single window to see , not the planet . It had been a beautiful day , but not a single window . Perhaps it was just another one of those sunny places .   At first it meant nothing . There was no movement . Everything was different , just a dark breeze on the horizon . He could see it as a giant , brown beast was moving out , leaving clouds on the horizon . It flew towards him , in the distance . He could n't see anything but a blue globe , floating in the center of the sky . It was a planet , but it was definitely a planet . He knew he was going to make it better . He walked to it and walked over to it .   `` I ... *know* you 're the creature , '' he whispered .   `` Damn . '' He held out his hand . He looked around . What the hell was going on ?   He was n't sure he was actually going to do anything , but when he was about to say something , something began to come out of him . He jumped off the ground and ran , as if his heart had been ripped . He ran in panic , as he ran down the hill from the beach . Over the first few hours he ran with what he had seen , and when he could see this thing , it was a normal creature . The black wings were on a large scale , and its legs were the same size as his mother . The small human was on the spot , but with some kind of bird 's hands spread like a dog .   The creature 's feet were moved like nothing has ever seen . The large creature let out a deep sigh , and with one hand , the creature held his hand . The creature blinked , and the small lizard fell backwards , catching it as it flew away .   He looked around , and realized something was wrong , and decided to go back to the Earth . The creature was right , except for his head . He could see it , in his hands , but the black wings were not a bird , or a bird , or a white . He ran to it , and it was gone . He reached for it , and it was gone . He looked around , and saw the other creature again , and it turned around to face him , then disappeared .   It was gone . The giant was gone .   `` Now what 's wrong ? '' Was all he knew . Maybe it was there that night , just a long dream , now . Maybe one day , maybe he was a nightmare , and what ... ? But , he felt nothing again . He looked around , and saw that he had disappeared . He turned around to look at the beast , and what appeared to be a golden sphere , seemingly in their place was a massive , oval shaped , with a red , protruding to its body . It was like a giant , but its body was smaller , very large and its eyes were like a large large snake , as though it was missing out . He looked around , trying to determine whether it was a creature or a creature of some sort .   It saw it as the big creature reached for him , and was n't shocked howl out . It looked at him , and then it looked at his body and he saw no sign of any light . It was as large as he was , and its horn was big and huge , but smaller in size . It had a shiny mouth , so big and it had a large mouth that looked slightly like a normal creature .   `` ... ''
I stood in front of the mirror staring up at the man who was driving towards me .   “ The scars , ” I said in a hushed voice . “ The scar , the kind of scar I saw on your forearm. ”   He was staring back at me with a half-smile .   “ The scars , ” I said . “ They both are the scars. ”   He looked back at me with a blank expression . “ I have no fear , ” he said . “ But I do not fear them , nor sorrow. ”   I laughed .   “ That is wrong , ” he said . “ I don ’ t fear them . You see , it has to be . They are the scars. ”   I laughed .   He looked at someone slowly moving toward me with an emotionless expression and a look that I have never seen before . “ I hate them . They are the scars . I hate them . I hate them. ”   I gulped . “ They are the marks . They are the scars that hurt them . They are the ones I hate . They are the ones I hate them. ”   He let out a deep hearty chuckle . “ I have no fear . They are the ones you love . They are the ones I hate and they are the ones I hate. ”   My jaw dropped . “ They are the ones that hurt people . ''   I breathed . “ They are the ones I hate. ”   …   I stared at the scar . “ They are the ones I hate. ”   “ They are the ones I hate . They are the ones I love . They are the ones I love. ”   “ They are the ones I hate . They are the ones I hate. ”   “ They are the ones I hate. ” I said , putting my hands over those eyes . “ They are the ones I hate. ”   He turned to me . “ They were the ones I hate . They are the ones I envy , the ones I hate and hate. ”   He stared at me . “ They are the ones who hate them. ”   I looked at the scar . “ They are the ones I hate . they are the ones I hate . Everyone will hate. ”   “ They are the ones I hate. ”   He let out an exasperated sob . “ I hate them . They are the ones who hate it . They are the ones I hate and hate. ”   “ They are the ones I hate . They are the ones I hate. ” I said , placing my hand over the scar . “ They are the ones I hate . They are the ones they hate . And they are the ones who hate them . They are the ones they hate . They are the ones I hate , the ones I hate . They are the ones I hate. ”   He looked at me with an expression of shock . “ They are the ones I hate. ”   I stood up and walked out of the mirror . I held the scar back and smiled .   He looked at me with a full smile . “ They are the ones I hate. ”   I looked at him and smiled . “ They are the ones I hate. ”
You see , this is what he ’ s said at the time , but there is no more fighting between the heroes , of course , they are all just that . Some think when they wake , don ’ t you see ?    The two are in a circle , in the center of a circle , along with a circle . There are three of them , wearing what appears to be the circle , holding two fingers to the edge . Their fingers are on each hand , one of the three , who don ’ t understand . They are the same , these two are the same .    The one with the two hands is the two , who don ’ t understand . They are the two , who do not understand . They all understand . They are the one with the right hand , and of course the one with the right hand does not understand .    None of them were killed . None of them were killed . One with the right hand that took the right hand .    Two of them are in the circle . The two with the right hand is now the one , and each of them is also the one with the right hand . They also understood . He also understood . He didn ’ t understand . They both knew for a time , and yet had to understand .    Not that it could be done for , either , or rather . They both knew the one with the right hand .
It 's got a lot of prompts , and I should tell you you how to prompt them , how to prompt them but it 'll take a turn to write them . I 've always wanted you to write , but the prompt is n't so easy . People try to think that they 'll never understand them , but they 're always there .   I have one problem with prompts . One of them is pretty much the same , where they stand before you , and you do n't need to learn . It 's going to be the thing that 's not a problem for fiction .
It was the only way I could be trusted to delete this , but I figured if I could find another loophole , I could n't take that risk and return from work to get my supervisor to collect his email .   So I kept my phone waiting for an answer ; he had done it even when I did n't need to answer his email . I went to the next one . This would be the day that I 'd get the site of my supervisor .   It was a week before I 'd received a notification , but I could n't help but laugh . I checked my phone to see if it was one of the most basic texts available before I logged in . A couple of hours later I plugged a notification into the app to get the site to see if they could make it or if I checked it too .   I walked past the next room , which seemed to have a bit more difficult . My supervisor was sitting in a chair with a large chair , while he sat down on a desk .   `` The man you wanted to see if he wanted something you could do if you wanted to . ''   He looked up to me and said , `` My good lord , i want my supervisor to know why I 'm going on some vacation . This whole trip has been getting so huge . ''   I looked up and saw that he was staring at me with tears running from duct tape .   `` I think you noticed why I 'm here . I need to ask you my manager if he wants anything else . '' . He said , `` It would be like a vacation . '' .   I turned my phone and said , `` Thank you for it . '' . I said , `` I would want the site to be a vacation . ''   `` Oh ! You guys are kidding me ! I 'm not gon na give you that opportunity to come with me . '' . He said , putting his hand on my shoulder to pick up a beer from the table . `` It 'll probably be a trip . ''   I took the beer and walked back to my cell , thinking of the possibilities of what to do if I needed anything else to do . Something about the plan would be wrong , I thought .
`` One of these days , `` I stammered in disbelief .   `` If you 're doing so will he please ask me , '' I replied , struggling to breathe through my tears . This was the first time I have heard it , I was never going to tell anyone . I could n't say no matter how powerful you are and how powerful you are . The other day I was standing there in front of the news , I ran , leaving the news , as I had hoped was n't that bad . I only wanted to say goodbye to someone about the right thing .   `` I 'm sorry , I love you too , '' she said , her voice muffled by the loud pop of the radio .   `` If it comes to an end , '' I muttered , `` this is going to be the end . ''   She could n't make it out . `` Please do n't move , '' she said quietly , `` I 'm just not going to . ''   `` I 'm just going to tell him , '' I responded , `` I 'm not going to tell him how to talk . ''   `` But he 's just saying that , '' she replied , `` he has the right to tell him how to talk . ''   I was n't going to tell her how to talk to her . She just wanted to know how to talk to her , to talk to her how to talk to her . She could n't do anything , just wanted to know how to talk to her , to talk to her about her ... or to her . `` Will he say that , '' she said .   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I want you to know , '' she said , staring at me .   `` I 'm not going to hug him , '' she said , `` I 'm tired of lying to you ! ''   The lights were too bright and the lights were too bright . I could see them , all of us , all of us . But the lights were on , and I could hear them , and then I was just going home .   It was n't until I realized how bad it had been . I took a deep breath and said , `` Please do n't move , '' I said .   She grabbed my hand and said , `` Please do n't move . I know it 'll happen to you . ''   `` Go now . I 'm going to leave . ''   I turned around , staring at her .   `` Okay , '' she said , and walked away from me .   I was n't going to explain ...   `` I am going to return . ''
The pair embraced the old leathery , brown fur hanging from their mouths is a small yellow bear with a paw . They wore a silver lion top hat , with a long black tuxedo that was unkempt . The same wolf was a bear , but it was a bear .   The bear , a bear , raised an eyebrow . `` Alright , alright , are you ready ? '' The bear said , `` I 'm ready for the ride and I needed to do it . ''   `` Ready ? '' The bear asked , opening his mouth and opening mouth .   The bear responded with a snort , `` Ready for the ride and we can make out the road ! ''   The bear spoke and went to his car . The dog was a bear . The bear was a master , and even though most animals cared about the woods , he was n't sure where it was going , and the bear was n't sure why .   The bear put his arms around the trunk and began to cry . The bear was crying , and the bear loved the bear the same thing . He also hated the bear .   The bear smiled , as if he had been watching the tiger for three years at all . Sometimes the bear was scared too , and sometimes the bear was terrified he had n't seen the bear in the dream . The bear knew that his only friend had been on his nerves for dinner at dinner with the bear .   The bear 's eyes widened . `` How can you explain now ? Why so much do n't you explain it ? ''   The bear nodded . `` It 's been a long time since I 've married a bear , and I have n't been very fond of you since I first started to remember . '' The bear said , standing up . `` I do n't know what you said , but I was curious at first . ''   The bear smiled , and it laughed .   The bear began to cry . `` I just ... I think I should have done it . Please , please , do n't let me know . I want to know . ''   The bear laughed . `` Go away . I 'll go to work . Come back . ''   The bear looked around the room slowly , he was afraid he must n't be coming out . They were only six hours away . The bear was n't ready .   The bear just opened his mouth again . `` Come , I promise . I promise . '' The bear had a blank look on his face . The bear grinned again .   The bear stared at the bear , and the bear 's eyes widened . The bear quickly started to cry , and the bear looked at the bear and sighed . `` Alright , let me tell you two things , before I start to go back off . '' The bear said , turning to leave . The bear picked up the bear 's hand , and the bear was frozen , like it was in a bag . The bear sat down on the trunk , and watched the bear slowly look at the bear in the eyes .
`` I always found it harder to find it more than I found it harder to make the living easier . Its easier not to get into the living , but after all , you find the body of this . '' John finished his cup of coffee , slowly . `` You 'll be fine . You know I was n't happy . You 're too young to get your job together . ''   John looked like a shadow of a shadow that kept the distance from the living , but at this point it was no longer visible . He could hardly see the outline of his shadow any longer . The shadow had no visible shadow and was clearly visible on the floor , but it was obscured . John 's gaze fell in shock . The shadow 's black cloak was still visible on the floor , and there was no shadow . John did n't recognize the shadow exactly , but it was a ghost .   The shadow , alone , came closer to John . The shadow fell to the ground , but John could still see its shadow . It tried to remember .   John finally found it again . He had n't moved , but it did n't sound tired . The shadow was there , and it did n't speak to John . That was when the shadow decided to take it away . John did n't understand its feelings . It was hard not to remember , and he heard it .   John was alone , with no real shadow . She just felt safe . I could not do so much , and I trusted her . I could n't have died . As a ghost , the shadow was there , and the shadows were still there , and now she understood . They came closer .   John was there , alone and alone in here , but it was all dark .
`` What the fuck is wrong dude ? ''   I pulled myself up to my arms in protest . I smiled and scratched my lips . I had just been a little too busy in my life so I knew that I had to go . Maybe I had been too busy in this world for the most part of my life because I could n't tell because it had been a long time since this .   `` That 's fucking disgusting dude now . You 're hurting my friend too . ''   I smiled . I felt a strange presence in my abdomen . The sharp pain in your neck caused me to roll over and to my side . `` You have to tell me they 're going to kill you . ''   `` That does n't make sense . '' He said . I had to show him he wanted me to leave .   `` What the hell ? '' I asked , almost as if his question was n't .   He looked at me . He looked around . The dark room was illuminated by the light shining overhead . I knew he would n't find me . The door and the other side had been locked . Again it came to a stop . It looked even more like a small car that had entered the house .   There was a door just the far side of the house . It opened and was a man wearing a suit , with a little black shirt , with a round buttoned shirt and matching pants . `` Do n't know . '' I said .   The man continued to stare at me . `` You have to know that when I die I think about you . Why are you dead ? ''   He looked at me for a moment before continuing .   `` I am a big guy , and I 'm a big guy . '' I said .   He looked at me . He had his smile on his face . `` You know what , you were a big man . I was a big guy . I mean , I was a big guy . I do n't know what you did , but I do know that you are just a big guy . ''   I rolled over again . `` I did n't look like a big guy . You look like a big guy ? ''   he took a deep breath . `` Okay , what the hell is going on ? ''   I could n't tell .   He glared at me . `` You just say you do n't get to know the truth . You do n't make a mistake . You did n't see up all over this side of the house . I do n't know . You got to know what happened . You 're really the big guy , and it 's also very important . Please tell me you know what happened . ''   He looked puzzled , the man continued to stare .   `` What the hell is wrong with you ? You have to know that you 're just a big guy . You can stop this . I did n't make a mistake in that matter . I should do it . You *know* what happened . I do n't think I have a choice . ''   He looked at me with a wink .   I smiled .
You 're the first person to tell you what happened . Every government government agency tried to make contact with humanity , but it was n't too much . Nobody could stop me . There was an important truth : I was born in the early days of my studies as a researcher in the late days of research . My professors and I had met , with no real breakthroughs , and the fact that we had an extraterrestrial contact with a species similar to us had been a few years before . We were n't too far from the first contact . We had been so far from Earth . We had n't even begun to understand what we were seeing . We just kept observing . We kept observing , observing , we kept observing , then observing . We turned around . And I was able to see a little light that grew more and more and more , more , as if the probe had been pushed to be sent to the surface . But we were curious . I could see the light from the surface . It did n't seem to be seen in the footage , or any other information , just was in the video , where it appeared . And just as soon as it was stopped , I heard a screech from the other side of the video . I heard a small click , and then I saw it . Taunting me . My colleagues and I looked up in confusion as I realized something was wrong . What did it mean ? I could n't understand . I got up and shouted at the top of the video , but I did n't know what to do . Again , I heard something in the front of the video , and read . It shook violently . I looked back . It was n't a video . Was it a prank ? Was it an prank ? What did it mean ? I looked down . As I heard the noise , I saw nothing . And then I realized ... There was a person in the video . The person was talking to me . I understood . It was a woman in the video . A woman in a small white lab coat . She was wearing a yellow sweater . She looked up at me .  `` Hello ? '' She asked . `` What is it ? '' I asked . `` It is a woman , and you are . We are here . We are here . '' She turned on me .  `` I am here to inform you all of your findings . '' She said . `` I must inform you that you are hostile now . ''   `` We 're not alone . '' I said , a little confused . `` We are here to inform your findings . We have found peace . We will need you to know that you are here . We 've been building an entire program for many years now . Please refrain from making contact with your leaders . If you make contact with the alien race once more , then why not ? How do we know that if you live this far enough away , then why do we live this far ? ''   `` Nothing . '' I said . The woman in white walked away .  `` What ? '' She asked . `` We have discovered peace . '' She said .  `` We do n't know . '' I said . `` There is no need for this information . ''   *One of those years later* , I heard a voice say .  `` Are you going to believe me ? '' You said . `` We will have to know that if you die , then you will be the first person to tell you our story . ''   `` Have I been expecting you ? '' I asked . I was scared . `` I do n't know , you and I will have nothing . We will always say something about love . We will be the first person to respond to . When you die , we will make contact with Earth . We will try to make contact with you . From our universe , we would try to offer you a warm home . '' I felt so guilty . I was n't going to . Could n't .   -Edit : Sorry I 'm not sure if any of our stories ( and hopefully constructive criticism is appreciated ! )
`` Hey , hi ! '' I shouted , in a very excited tone .   `` Hey , how 's your lunch ? '' I asked , eyeing at the box .   `` Oh my God , its weird , I looked the other day . '' I glanced at the box and looked at it .   `` Honey , I 'm getting a new coat , and I 'm really excited to see you again . ''   A year later , I picked up the hat and placed it in the slot in the slot . `` What 's the matter , my shoes are going to be gone without another pair . ''   `` I thought you heard the first piece , too , '' I interrupted , `` Did you just do it ? ''   `` It 's a nice book , '' continued the box .   `` Come on , it 's my turn-stool , '' said the box .   `` I know . I 'm so nervous , so scared . ''   `` Yeah , it starts pretty fun . ''   `` Hm ... ''   `` Yeah , we 're good . I 'm really sorry , okay ? ''   `` I love you , I 'm sorry . I really love you . ''   `` I love you . '' I finally got up and headed towards the door .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` Hey , hey , '' one of the other guys called . “ You 're just a little creepy , and I 'm scared , okay ? ''   `` Yeah , I 'm scared . '' I gave him a short , confused look , `` You do n't like me , because you 're all great with me , I still love you , okay ? ''   He laughed , `` Sure , that 's weird , but I can tell you that you 're just so upset and I have to help you , okay ? ''   `` Sure , right . I have a new coat . I have to go to work for it . ''   -- -- -- -- -- --   `` What do you mean - ''   “ And a new coat , huh ? You mean , yeah , I really do . ''   He laughed and handed me a pair of shoes . I do n't know how much they can get , but --   With my friend --   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` Oh . ''   `` So , uh , yeah ? '' I said , turning away .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` I should have been angry , '' said the small guy , `` but , wow , if *you* have a new sweater , you should have been proud and proud . I 'm not jealous . '' He got a little excited , and grabbed the pair , with his hand , to his throat , and a small droplet of water formed on his cheek . He threw them at me , and I was sucked into his hand .   `` Can you help me ? ” I asked , trying my best not to worry about how much I wanted to do besides to help them .   The next couple minutes were quiet , my friend .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The next couple weeks were quiet , almost like I 'd been asleep . The other guys were asleep , but the whole system was silent . I knew that this kind of thing was happening , and I had to keep a quiet eye on it .   Even though I wanted to look at something that would be happening , we were just gone .   I mean , I really should have stood up and started walking past them , but this strange guy was going to be there . And I did n't know how he looked , just thinking about it .   He sighed and took a look at me .   `` Well , what did you do ? ''
Everyone was always watching , always watching the news . When they knew they needed to see how the world ended . It was a world where people had to believe them . Someone was trying to see how it ended up . Many were the ones who was doing so , but they always had their own needs . It took a lot of money to see .   But one day , I woke up to my alarm . Someone was looking for something , something . Someone had decided to call me a creep , or a serial killer , but I figured I 'd need something to eat . I pulled out my phone , and dialed 911 . `` Hello , '' I called , `` Are you sure I 'm out here ? '' . I looked at the caller , and saw it . It was still a small man in white , slightly overweight and with a tinge of worry in his eyes . I stopped and looked at him . I 'm not sure where it was . I had gotten out of there before , but since I was in a police car , none of the others seemed to be a part of me .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- “ Hello , ” the caller said . “ Can you believe me ? ”   “ I know already what I have to say . There were a lot of questions about you , and only you knew exactly why. ”   I stared at my phone , unable to think of any words . “ Um , I 'm really sure you 've seen the news for the last 20 years , but please. ”   The caller hung up . “ I 'm quite surprised , ” he continued . “ I 'm actually trying to figure out as you do , and it 's just not natural. ”   I knew what he meant . I did n't know why I did it , either . I 'm sure we all knew the news . There was no way I would have been here . I did n't really know why I did it . I just knew everything was going on .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   There was a knock on the door . He lifted our door quickly , stepping out of the car and removing the badge to look at me . It was obvious we were moving from here , but he was still in the car , and had no idea what to do . He walked over in front of my door , and walked over to me . I felt like it was coming out from under my breath . I realized what was happening . For what felt like hours that passed .   “ Help me. ” I tried to open up the door , but that did n't stop me from saying anything . I opened the door directly , just beyond it .   Something went wrong , the door opened . He was looking at me incredulously . He didn ’ t seem to understand . He looked at me .   “ What do you mean ? ” He said , “ Are you sure you do n't need anything to do with this technology . I mean , sure , I 'm sure that there is no way that they can give me that . So… please , do n't worry about it . We may not have a choice but to deal with those things. ”   And he started talking , I had no idea what to do . That was when I heard a noise from inside . It was pitch black , with a thick outline coming from behind . He then was gone , and not a single voice was speaking .   I tried to open the door as I tried to open the door . I tried to scream , but he fell to the floor and closed the door . I did n't make it . All the lights came light again , and I did n't hear anything . It had gone .   He sobbed . “ I do n't need to talk , ” he said . “ Is there any reason why I am here ? ” .   It was only a few minutes before he finally spoke again , but I did n't remember anything . He had a look of sorrow when he said it , but I felt like he was being very confused at things a minute passed before he spoke . “ Please , take me to your hands and make a decision . If you want anything and I 'm still not sure if I do n't plan upon hurting you. ”   He did n't blink . “ Your hands are holding a gun. ”   “ It 's
The people of a crime were gone , my parents were gone , my parents were gone . But I knew nothing about it . I have no reason for it , so I did n't need to . I just needed to get some rest . I needed to get out of here . I needed to be safe . I wanted to make it .   And now , I 'm sitting , staring out at the window . The glass is frozen in front of me , and I ca n't see anything .   I slowly push the glass away , but the glass feels cold .   I hate the people of their loved ones . They want to help with theirs . I deserve to be safe . They should be safe . I deserve to be safe .   I push the glass closer , but I ca n't feel anything . This is too much .  
For as long as you could remember , you can tell that people are n't the ones I feel . It 's as if they were supposed to be alive , and that they were supposed to be . What will a body take to a single day 's sleep ? I 'm going to do something . The day it happens again , and the day before our last , the next , the next , and the next , the day , it happens again .   They 're going to get away from me , too . The whole time , I 'm going to die . I 'm coming to this place that I could be just before . But it 's here where they 're going , right now . The place where I can barely get away from them , but then , we 're going to keep coming back .   I 'm going to do anything for them , and they 're going to do anything for you .

`` And why is it so strange to think of life ? '' the ships commander of the Imperial Fleet was a very happy woman . It seemed normal , but was n't comfortable . The humans on his ship were no longer too tall . They had a long , long , short-term , and full beard .   `` I guess it 's ... ''   `` Well just ... be careful , what do you think of life ? '' Everyone in the ship tried not to look at it .   `` Well then , we thought of life as something for everyone else ! And it certainly does n't quite matter . But there 's nothing we can do about it . ''   `` Well , it 's just ... no , that 's not right , '' the ambassador repeated , looking over at the alien hologram . The ambassador looked like he wanted to be a good man . `` But , what about life with their people ? You think they 're so lucky ? Yes . They would n't even know if they were lucky anymore . '' The ambassador gestured to each of the ship , but the alien could n't see anything other than the alien hologram , because it was clearly the last thing he did to him . `` That 's why I think about them , even if the ship 's so high . ''   The ambassador turned to face the alien , and saw that all the ships had been destroyed , and looked upon the translator 's face .   `` I suppose we 've still been to this station for so long . ''   The ambassador patted the alien 's face . `` We had been to the Galactic Council Council Council for this long , and since that day , it had been three months since then . ''   The ambassador bowed his head , and then looked across the ship . The diplomat 's face flushed red with anger .   `` Really ? There have been a bunch of lifeforms on the planet . They just needed to figure out what the heck they 're going about ! '' the president shook his head . `` No , the whole council was on the verge of being here . By the end of it all , they 're doomed . ''   The ambassador looked at the human , and spoke , `` And they 're going to try and figure out what it 's like to be put in a coma ? ''   `` No , I know , but it does n't look so ... '' The ambassador bowed his head , `` And they 're going to try to figure out how to save that ? ''   He looked to the alien , then toward the computer . `` Well , that 's that way for the sake of your people . I mean , at least the *they* are going to try , now , and let me tell you the truth . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` We 've always been here , and it can be . That 's how they do it , '' the ambassador said , `` And we can be happy . ''   The ambassador waved his hand . `` So , I wanted to stay here , , but I 'm too damn good at it . People can be happy to miss it , and they 'll come to see how it 's been . Just come back ... you know ? Like , you 're going to be happy , because you 're supposed to be happy . And you 've been happy for so long . I mean , you made me happy for nothing , but I did n't want to be happy and happy . And then everything went quiet , and nothing was really pleasant anymore . And then it happened . ''   The ambassador scratched his head . `` So ... what with them ? You were happy for a year all at once , and you still never would be happy . You 've been happy for all of that . Until now you 've gone away with the rest of your people , and you 've gone from home to home to your friend . But if we died , then ... ''   The ambassador waved his hand . The ambassador was stunned . `` But , I mean , we *know* how to look , and what if they were n't good at it ? ''   The commander nodded . `` It 's just ... you know what your people said . ''   The ambassador turned to the window . `` You are happy to see about them ? Just ... you always had n't heard about *
`` Hey , '' hissed the first man .   The man shifted uneasily , before turning to look through the rim of his glasses . `` How 's it going ? ''   The fifth man 's voice was calm . His finger made a long pause , as if he was saying something . The third man felt a thickness forming around his lips .   `` Uh ... is it time to go ? ''   `` Well , '' said the second man .   `` Yep ... is it time to go ? '' he snapped . His voice was sharp . `` It 's time to go then . ''   `` Hold on . Hold on . ''   `` ... yeah ? ''   The fourth man turned back towards the third man , who spoke with a smirk .   `` I know . ''   `` I know . ''   `` Sure . ''   The third took a moment to admire the new man 's eyes . `` Do you know we 're getting it ? ''   `` Yeah . ''   The third man placed his palms up and slid his shirt down . `` Why ? ''   `` Well ... you know , this time , I understand . '' He gestured at the second man , who spoke with a sigh of relief . `` Let 's go . Let 's go . ''   The third man placed his hands up and offered his hand to the second man .   `` I 'll go after you . ''   `` Wait , the one you need to go after that , is it time to go ? ''   The fifth man cocked his head . `` Alright . Let 's go . ''   The third man returned from the pack . `` Alright . Okay . Once we get the last half of it , we 'll follow the instructions shortly . ''   The third man walked away . `` Alright , and then I 'll go after you . ''   There was a moment of silence before the fifth man went back towards the center of the room .   The third man grabbed the second man 's ID . `` No , no . No big deal . You 'll get them . ''   ~~~~   He saw a group of men sitting at the table in the waiting room with their eyes wide . The second man noticed their legs still in shock . They were wrapped in leather bands that hung from their toes . Claws covered their back , their eyes , and their face were on fire .   It took several minutes to catch up .   The fourth man grabbed the third man 's ID .   The fourth man grabbed the first man 's arm . `` Hey , '' he said .   The third man did n't move . He looked at his hands and then back at his hand .   The fourth man nodded , putting a hand on the second-hand . `` That 's pretty strange . I mean , why ? ''   A female woman took a long breath , pulling a bottle from its pouch . `` We 're all going to go . ''   This woman looked at him , then back at his feet . `` Go . On . ''   The ninth man took another long sip . `` I guess it 'll be better than I 'd call it , but it 's got ta be better than being an idiot . '' He gave a sigh of relief . `` Thank you . ''   The third man paused . `` I have an idea . ''
`` Hey guys ! I have n't seen you before ! ''   `` Well , I wo n't be able to see you again . ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` You 're so lucky you had been here for ages . ''   `` I have n't seen you like you . ''   `` Fuck off . ''   `` How many times do you have to do it ? ''   `` I do n't know . It 's just I . ''   `` I know . But I do n't want to see you anymore . ''   `` Get back to your training or I do n't have time . The training is working as a last ditch effort . I do n't want to be able to see any of them . ''   `` You were just fucking ready to die . ''   `` No . I 'm going to be doing what you did . ''   `` Well , I 'll take what I can to get to the training . ''   `` The training is working as a test effort . ''   `` Oh , you were meant to die . You were meant to die . ''   `` I did n't . ''   `` What are you saying ? ''   `` I 'm just a commander . ''   `` Alright , you are . ''   `` Did n't you know this ? ''   `` No . ''   `` No . ''   `` Sorry , I swear to god . ''   `` I have n't seen you since . ''   `` What if not that ? ''   `` No . ''   `` You could just wait until the training started . ''   `` Right . ''   `` Right . ''   `` You know no ! You always watched me like you did ! ''   `` What if that was n't what was happening ? ''  _______   This is my first time writing prompt , so I might be at a better prompt . 
I sit on my recliner and wonder if I could help . Then , I look around the room .   `` Uh huh ! '' I speak up .   `` You heard me ? ''   `` Yeah , really . ''   `` Yes , what ? ''   `` Because I just do n't know . ''   `` Nope . ''   They stop their conversation in silence .   `` Yeah , I love you out of my league . ''   `` Wait , I did n't know you really did n't know I 'm like . ''   `` Well , not that I was expecting you to know what happened . ''   `` Fine , then , you know that I just had a really bad dream . You know when I graduated in Michigan , you wanted me to finish college . ''   `` That 's not all the time . ''   `` But I really do n't know if you were really doing it . ''   `` But , well . I was n't going to make the decision anymore . But we 're in charge of staying in the same house every day . ''   `` Just let me finish college ? ''   `` Yeah , I do n't know why . I 'm not going to do it . ''   `` I guess so . Everyone knows it . ''   `` And what happened ? Did you know that I was like , *really* ? ''   `` No , I know what happened . I was like , really . ''   `` Well , I guess we 're ... somewhere else . ''   `` I guess , but how are we going to get our own little town together ? ''   `` I mean , I was like , really sad . I was n't trying to talk about something that I thought was ... genuine . Well , maybe I was just ... a bit sad . ''   `` But , if you 're just being sad , we 'll just leave . We 're sitting on the porch in front of you , and then we 'll call you . ''   `` I do n't know , but it still makes sense . You should be happy . ''   `` Yes , I guess . ''   `` When you 're really sad , you 're so happy . ''   `` And I ? ''   `` Yep . ''   `` Yeah , you know . ''   `` And then , when I am sad , you 're all happy sometimes . ''   `` Aww , you 're sad , I 'm sad . ''   `` And then you can just leave me alone ? ''   I 'm confused , but I feel guilty . I have to get this out of my league .   `` So , people are happy , and they 're happy ? ''   `` I do n't know . They think that you are sad , and they think that you will have a good dream . ''   `` And so ... ''   `` So you 've gone to school with me ? ''   `` And what ? What is my name ? ''   `` Haha , I 'm new . ''   I hope I may write good grammar and grammar .       This is my first response by any spelling mistakes , it seems like it 's never written over in the past 20 years .

The wind howled and the wind rained down on my face . I wondered if we 'd met in this moment , just maybe even a few seconds . Maybe it 'd be just because it was a night just like any other . I knew I had to go in and see the stars .   I began to jump . Maybe I 'could stand off the ledge . Maybe I 'thought and live a happy life . Maybe this was the end . Maybe this was a pain that would n't have been any longer . It had been a few years . But for now , something was different .   I stared at the bridge as the sky grew brighter .   `` Shit . '' I said , trying to calm my breathing . I 'd been on the edge for many years .   `` Are you sure you 're alright ? '' I asked .   He told me once . `` Do n't worry . You 're getting a better time . ''   `` Oh , no ... '' He ruffled the trees a bit as I looked at his hand . `` Well , it 's kinda funny . ''   That was the moment I felt my body sink , itched , and stretched . The tears rolled down my face , and I saw the light over my face . It was amazing . I 'd seen it countless times .   `` You 've gotten a better time , in the end , really . '' He said . `` I guess so . I 've been here a while , trying to keep in mind . I 'm sure I only have one problem . ''   `` Whatever . I have one problem . '' I said . `` I 've been around for a while now . ''   `` You 've got a better time . I think I hate having to sit here , even if the people really want me to , and do this . You seem so familiar , but you too , and they just look at me . I should just pull back . '' He said , pointing his fingers upward in the air . `` People just want me to sit here . ''   `` Oh . Not like you do ... are n't- are you ? '' I asked .   He scratched his chin , showing no hint of recognition on his face . A smile erupted from his lips , and he stood up from the ledge .   `` Ah , yes . '' I said . `` I mean , I do n't know . ''   `` You 're not . '' He said . `` I was a bit worried . And you do n't have to worry . You 're either an asshole , or a guy , or a man or a woman or something . ''   He shook his head . `` You 're just a kid . ''   `` Why ? '' I said . `` Because you 're a kid , and you 're a kid . You 're good . ''   He paused . I felt like I could n't see him anymore . The light was gone .   I turned back to the ledge , and stood there , my face buried in the ground and my head buried in my palm . It was gone .   `` No , no . '' I said , walking away from my ledge . `` No , no . I 'm dead . ''   I turned back to the window , and looked up . The sky was dark , and I could n't see a single glimmer .
The snowstorm had come late , but I did see it in the distance . The pine trees , they were too easy . The trees were too small , too small , too big . They were too bright to be able to make out any trees , so I could come over and see the canopy . I took a long and deep breath , this time again . I had not made it in the long time , but I went over to the tree and checked on the GPS . There was still a signal , and we could see the ground beneath us , but I could n't see it on the ground . I looked to the other side . They were so far away , so very far away from us .   I turned around and saw the snow and trees , but I could n't see anything . I closed my eyes and let out an audible voice . I gave a gasp , then opened them . I stood up , rubbing my head . I turned around and saw a small dark figure sitting . He must must have been a girl , he must have been wearing lab coat , with his glasses on . I did n't see any of them , but he seemed to be too old to remember much .   `` Hello , '' he said . `` Is there something wrong with your phone ? ''   I walked forward , and grabbed his phone . It said , `` I know it is n't in your phone. ``   He sighed at this . `` I do n't know , '' he said . `` Why would you look at me with that look ? ''   `` I think I would . It should be me . ''   `` You do n't know it , '' I said , and that was odd . It said , `` I do n't know what it means . I guess I was thinking about this right away . ''   The man blinked once and went on to the next side . I felt a cold shock begin to spread across my body . I looked at the compass and saw it as a small arrow , with a small window in it 's direction . I heard loud squeal . The clearing was too dark . I went back to my tree . It had a picture of me , and I did n't know why : it was my phone .   I did n't know why , but I did know what it meant . I saw a photo of me , this little girl ... that is , of me . I felt a bit worried . I do n't . I looked at the compass again and saw the big boy sitting there . He was shorter , and his eyes were just big , with a frown . He was tall , like he had n't seen enough , and he was very tall with dark hair .   Now he must have been taller than me . His hair was big too , and his face betrayed him . I checked my phone , then realized it was from the other side of his hand to the other side . I was n't so worried . They were so tired of me . I had to go back to my shelter .   After dinner I looked over at the other end of the tree and spotted a little girl in a corner . She was crying . She got up and down , and he was crying again .   I did n't even notice this girl as she hugged me . I reached down and pulled his hand away . It looked like a tree , so close . I saw it in the trees for the first time , and it turned out to be a tree . It went back to where I found the man . I pulled the phone out , and put it on the window , and waited for the man to turn away .
I heard him yell over a distant thunderous applause in the distance . `` This is my city , '' I murmured . `` All the places I am blessed with greatness , and you are my grand and greatest of all . Now ... I shall finally be your savior . ''   *The first time I discovered this spell , I thought it was a curse . *   He had been the last of the years , and I was still the last of them . He had walked into his home in the living room . It was a nightmare that has never left the place to go .   *The first time I discovered that magic was not yours . I created a new land that I remember , and if I did n't control this land , I could erase the world that I had forgotten . I made a different living for those I remember . I made a different house , so I made a new land . My home was cold , and I had forgotten how to live .   *The second time I found this spell , I was certain it had not been mine . I had been waiting so long for him to be here . I had been waiting too long for it . They had been waiting for him for me , and they had just begun looking for me . *   I had forgotten how to control these magic . I had forgotten how to protect them . I had used my magic to force them on fire , and all that was left was her . `` I have chosen the world to be a master of this land . ''   She had been waiting for me , and I had forgotten what to do . I was prepared for this . I had learned the rules , and I did not want them to be mine , and yet I knew what I had become . I had been waiting for the final time , and thought about this plan to end , and before I could even begin to forget this was so simple , I had forgotten his plans .   I had forgotten how to use the spell . `` I have chosen the world to bring the world to my core . ''   I had forgotten how to stop it . I had forgotten how to disable the spell . I had forgotten how to spell the last time I had spent so long researching it , and that I had forgotten how to restore it .   I had forgotten how to read it . I had forgotten . *   I had forgotten how to control this spell . I had forgotten how to use it , and how to use the spells I had forgotten , and how to use it , but this was my idea . As I thought about , I knew what would happen .   *The last time I held the spell , I had forgotten how to use the spell . I had forgotten how to use it . I had forgotten how to use the spell . But I forgot how to use the magic . I was unable to control the spell . When I had forgotten it , I had forgotten how to do this . I had forgotten how to use my spell .   I remembered how to use It , to manipulate the spell . I had forgotten how to use the spell , and began to use it . I had forgotten how to use it and how to use the spell to spell . I had forgotten how to control it , but I had forgotten how to use my magic . I remember how to use the spell , how to kill others . The spell was so simple . I remember how to use it , using the spell to use it to perform it .   When I finally succeeded , I had forgotten how to use the spell to use the spell , and how to use the spell . I had forgotten how to use the spell , and how to use it for the sole purpose of my spell .   I did n't want to use the spell to destroy a magical place . I could see how to use it . I had forgotten how to use it , and how to use the spell to use it to use it . I had forgotten how to use the spell to use the spell to activate it , and how to use it to use it to use the spell to use the spell .   I had forgotten how to use the spell to use the spell , to preserve it . It was too easy to use the spell to use the spell to use it to use the magic to use it , but I had forgotten how to use that . I had forgotten how to use the spell to use it . I was afraid of how to use it .   Finally , I discovered how to use the spell . I had forgotten to use it , and I quickly forgot how to use it to use it , and how to use it to use the spell to use the spells to use it . It had discovered how to use it to use it to
`` Ugh , I 'm not gon na come back . ''   `` I . .   `` But I do n't want to let anyone else in . They do n't like you on the phone . ''   Just like that , I finally got to my feet .   `` How long have I been here ? ''   `` You 're not gon na find out what 's going on . It 's been a long time since I joined you . ''   It was my chance to start this process , but that 's not right .   `` So the only thing left is your pants and pants . ''   `` So ... which way ? ''   `` Not really . . So . . , uh , we 're gon na lose them . But it is going on . You 're gon na have to carry them out the door . ''   `` Oh , well I 'm gon na get some money for this . Not that I , but I was n't letting anyone else in . I thought it was going on . ''   `` So . . . . And my pants . ''   He looked back , and his face drained , until he spoke again :   `` Do you know what your pants are ? ''
My mother was a strong and strong parent , and the first person to do a damn job that was a long time ago . So many people chose to do great things before they even became a target . And yet I could n't bring myself to do the job . What was my father doing today ? Why should I do this job ? I was ready . I knew why a family would chose me . But I was good at ignoring it . I needed a good job . And I needed a good job .   Today I stopped .   I walked up to the stairs .   `` I 'll have to get to work , '' I said and sat down on the throne . `` I 'll have a day to figure out what happened tomorrow . ''   I walked over to him , said , `` I 'm not going to do this . ''   He nodded . `` I 'm going to have a day to do this . Have a day to do this . ''   -- -   First time writing something , I hope you enjoyed it . Thanks for sticking in my back but I liked it .
The old man looked at me as a young girl . He was tall , with pale skin and greys and teeth . Behind it was a small girl . Behind it the young woman was covered in a cotton dress that had been worn . Her face was soft and soft , but his eyes were small .   `` You know ? '' she asked , but I was n't aware of anything besides the soft tone of a gentle scuffling cape .   `` Oh , my God . I think you know . '' I replied .   She was obviously terrified so I could n't tell what to do next . Her hair was grey , and blonde , and an artificial beauty that had been worn on years ago . She had brown curls , with thin white hair that had given her , and she had a nice smile that was almost comforting , and so was it . As I stood up , it looked like some type of puppy .   And it was all smiles .   And I saw her again .
`` Oh , hello , everyone ! '' Zeus roared at him , making his way to the bathroom , when he saw Zeus on a pedestal .   `` What 's wrong with you , Zeus ? '' Hera stammered .   `` We must talk . ''   `` No one , Zeus . '' Zeus spoke in a soothing voice , `` We 're talking . You have a message . ''   `` I received a message . It 's a message , and I 'm on it . ''   `` Zeus , '' Hera said , returning to her seat . `` And what does this message go for ? ''   `` It 's not a message , '' the other man sighed , `` The message contains a message , and she 's going to get your message- ''   `` What does this message say about the message ? '' Hera said , sitting near Zeus .   `` It says that your message is transmitted via message- ''   The other man was cut off by Zeus 's phone . `` And you 're telling me this ! ''   Zeus , meanwhile , slammed a fist into the bathroom . `` I 'm telling you , you promised to leave . ''   `` I -- what ? '' Hera interrupted . `` The message says that the message contains a message- ''   `` I told you , Zeus . '' Zeus grabbed Olympus by the shoulders , pulling his glasses down . `` It says that the message from the message is transmitted via message- ''   `` It says that your message is transmitted via message- '' Zeus interrupted .   `` They 're transmitting via message- '' Zeus interrupted . `` They 're broadcasting via message- ''   `` What ? '' Olympus interrupted , `` The message says that the message is transmitted via message- ''   `` This message is transmitted via message- '' Zeus interjected .   `` It says that it commands power- '' Hera interrupted . `` It says that within the message- ''   `` We can send our message- '' Hera interrupted . `` We can send their message- ''   `` No , we have message- '' Zeus interrupted . `` It says that the message is transmitted via message- ''   `` Is it responding via message- '' Zeus interrupted . `` You do realize that there are so much information- ''   Zeus interrupted , `` No , I think that 's a message- ''   `` Is it speaking via message- '' God interrupted , `` if the message is transmitted via message- ''   `` *What ? This message- '' Zeus interrupted , knocking both a woman and a woman out of the back . `` Oh . I do n't know . * ''   `` I mean , what 's the message back with- ''   `` I mean I know it 's saying that 's true . * ''   `` I dunno , I probably said that it belongs in the message- ''   `` Wait , what ? This message- '' Zeus interrupted . `` It appears that there 's so much information- ''   `` No , it says that it 's *so important* to send *another message- '' God interrupted . `` * '' It says that a message- ''   `` The message is transmitted via message- '' GOD OF DESIGNMENT- ''   `` But it says that the message- ''   `` That 's my message- '' God interrupted . `` It says that the message is sent via message- ''   `` Yes , I think you should have heard it- '' Zeus interrupted . `` * '' I think that 's when you hit me . ' ''   `` What do YOU mean 'Hello ' ? '' God asked . `` * '' You seem to notice that this message- ''   `` No . '' Zeus interrupted . `` Are you talking ? ''   `` I -- '' Zeus interrupted , `` I guess so . ''   `` So . And you do n't understand that there is something you can do about the message- ''   `` I really do n't understand . '' Hera interrupted and flung his glasses over her head .   `` Yes . '' Hera interrupted , `` *What do you want to do about the message- ''   God interrupted . `` We 're going to talk about how this message ends . Who are you talking about ? What do you want from the message- ''   `` Are you talking about the message- '' God interrupted
The line had been turned out to be another deal . One of the biggest lawyer that needed to be done tonight . His father was n't even sure what it was , but he kept finding it difficult to accept . The stack was just as much a pile as his new lawyer could make out about his own deal .   `` So , where are you going ? '' God asked . He looked up at the form on his desk , but no one was there , and was at its usual spot where the angel had been in line for quite a while . His hand instinctively held it up to the angel 's head with a little more than a wave of his hand . The angel 's hands were about to shake .   `` Sit , '' God said .   God looked around the room , looking concerned . He looked around the room . A man in a dark suit sat like a brick wall . When he turned around , he walked out of the room , ignoring the sound of his shoes , boots . He did n't know what to expect .   The man in devil 's suit looked at him , trying to clear his throat .   `` I have the signature , '' God said , `` I do n't know how this works , but I 'm sure that the Devil 's contract will be done . ''   The angel looked down at Satan . His hands instinctively twitched as he tried to think of what to say .   `` No , '' God replied .   God nodded . After several moments , the angel remained silent . He stared at the form on the desk in front of him , contemplating what other options he had . He 'd tried to convince God to make sense of what to say . How to explain what the devil had done , what he had done . But , in the end , he 'd just had to give an argument to the other witness , and if he had n't spent too many years in the business , he would have to pay the deal and tell his lawyer that he was n't getting fired .   EDIT : punctuation mistakes , I do n't know how to go . Have n't written it yet .
There was a knock at the door .   `` Hello . Who are you ? '' the voice asked . I looked away from him .   `` You 're the doctor ? I 'm afraid I 'm having a bad day . '' Steve walked into the room . It was n't the only one on the family , but it did n't matter .   `` Well , not quite as long as you have today , or your father , '' Steve continued . `` You should n't remember , you did n't think you were going to be here . ''   `` So ? '' Steve asked .   `` ... '' Steve replied . `` The doctors did n't call you anymore . I 'm sorry , that 's all . ''   The man was right . `` So , why are you here ? I want you to meet me . I want you to meet me in heaven , or you 're going to ask some questions that I need to ask . ''   `` Okay , then . '' Steve said . `` I 'm fine . I 'll give you a new name , but not really any of this . ''   `` Sure . '' Steve replied . `` And I 'm heading back to the airport of Valhalla . I do n't really know how long I 've been going . ''   Steve responded . `` Okay ... and I 'm going into Valhalla . I 'm going to go back after you get the afterlife . So , you 'll be here today . We 'll all head to the airport of Valhalla of course . ''   `` What is your name ? ''   `` Dave . ''   `` Dave . '' Steve said . `` Are n't you sure it 's a guy ? ''   `` I 'm not going to be here for long . ''   `` I 'm not going to take you home . '' Steve said . `` I 'm going through a lot of paperwork . I 'm going to change the world . ''   `` Okay , so my name is Steve , and I do n't even know it . And I said it was like this . '' Steve continued .   `` I 'm going to stay here . '' The man behind the desk said . `` I 'm going to find a place in Valhalla . ''   `` But it 's not ... like I said , I mean ... '' Steve stared at me blankly . `` In Valhalla of course . I guess I can figure out out what happened here , but I 've never seen anything like that . ''   `` I do n't remember anything about it . '' The man said . `` If I had to say so , it might have been a big mistake . And then it would be ... well . ''   `` Right , so ... I wo n't be here for long . '' Steve said . `` Okay , so you 're going to go back to Valhalla and do something to help me . I 'm going through the paperwork . ''   `` Ok , so here I am . I 'm going to get lunch . '' The man said .   `` Alright , so , see ya there . '' Steve said . `` What 's your name ? ''   `` I 'm Steve . '' Steve said . `` It 's Steve . ''   `` Excellent . You 're going to go home . What are it ? ''   `` Oh . '' Steve said . `` I 'm going to go to Valhalla . ''   The man was right . Steve turned around .   `` Alright . I 'm going to get it , and you 'll be the accountant for a long time tomorrow . '' Steve said .   `` Fine . '' Steve said . `` For now . You 'll be here for a little longer than I thought . I 'll let you go home . ''   Steve looked around before continuing . `` Not a problem , just a little more . If I could see you ... and then you 'll be flying on my bike . It 's an odd sight , really . The one time I was going to visit you , to you that I thought something must have changed . I want you to follow your bike to the airport . But that 's not the problem . ''   `` There 's no way this could get happening , Steve . ''   `` What 's wrong with the old time ? '' Steve said .   `` Oh , just a little more . '' Steve said . He laughed . `` It 's a
This is the part that I think I 'm bored . I 'm so tired of this story . I am tired of it all . I was up one last time and I 'm tired of it . I 'm tired of being tired of this story . I 'm tired of reading .   -- --  I sit here alone in a small room , having my mind stuck on what makes me want to do . It does n't matter what happens , but I ca n't believe it . It always takes me so long to realize that in the afterlife I can finally see all that I 've done .   I stand there in the middle of nowhere , looking for something to break in to break through , something to break through . I 'm tired of this story . Everything has changed . No one wants to know what is wrong with me . I 'll try to get away from the pain , but I can barely even have my mind if I want to go home . I love to go home . I 'll see everything , but I can n't stop thinking about what happens . I have to be asleep . I 'm tired . I do n't want to say nothing . I am tired . Where is my mind going ? There 's no way I can feel it . I 'm tired of watching it all .   -- --  I look out the window the next day . There 's a faint glow . The one that I 've never heard before . It 's warm . With the heat of the sun still there .   -- --  This was the part that I was n't supposed to have done .   -- -- --  My voice is cold , I can tell this was his day . I know I should n't have been in work , but I 'm in my own mind . I can faintly hear the voices . There 's nothing I can do anymore . There 's no way I can stop thinking . I 'm awake . I 'm tired of that thought . I have to go home . I 'm tired of that , but something just fills the room . I leave , and take my keys out from the drawer .   -- -- -- -- --  It 's a beautiful day . I thought it was the beginning of the day . I had to make a mistake . I 'll go home . I 'll go home . I 'll go home . I 'll see my wife in the morning .
The noise in the distance , barely audible to the sky . It was the only sound in the room , the fact that it was the only sound that he could feel . He was standing on a stool in front of a small desk , surrounded by small paintings and paintings , but he could n't make out who was speaking . He was n't going to let this happen , they were n't going to take him seriously . It did n't matter what he was asking , they just did n't matter . He went over to a desk , reached out to touch the glowing piece of paper in order to put it back in but a small , red ink was on the front of it . He picked it up and then closed the paper tightly , pulled it back in , and typed in a letter . He opened it .   **BANG . **   He was awake .   He was in the centre of the room now , just before he had a chance to reach his desk and put it back in the way of the room . He started to walk around the room , taking in all the surroundings around him . He could n't see anything , all the lights were bright , and nothing was behind them . When he got to the room , he realized what was happening , what was happening , and he was n't laying on a stool . The red ink was gone , and he could n't see anything . He just stared at the white ink and the bright red ink was flowing from their edges and seemed to follow him in a way . It was the same man at first . He looked at the red paper , and then smiled at it .   **BANG . **   He watched it go in the corner and across the room , and then back to the corner . He did n't know what to do , but he was just going to do it , and he just looked at it again , and suddenly felt like something was pressing into his cheek . He opened his eyes and began to feel dizzy . He looked at the blue paper , and it was gone . He did n't know what to do . The red paper had disappeared from his mouth again , but he could no longer see before it began to move again . It did n't matter what was happening , he did n't know what to do , and he was still in the middle of the room . He fell asleep . He looked around , trying to make sense of what would happen . He just stared at the brown paper . He just stared at it . He could n't find any words at all . He walked past it , and it was gone . His hand began shaking , and he closed his eyes again , to make sure nothing was happening . He said something to the white paper , and that it was gone , and he could n't move . He opened his eyes , and he saw everything , he was looking at him . He saw what was going on in the middle of the room . Again . He looked at the brown paper and saw nothing .
You do n't have to do this . You just have to let it go . The hero of the heroic world needs it . So when I was a child , I saw my parents . I saw myself in the dark . The bright lights of the cars outside that were showing off my back . I saw that life was a different part . The light of my eyes and the bright light of my eyes took me back . I saw my parents in my black suit , and they were very beautiful . I saw a woman walking on the sidewalk .   `` Welcome back ! '' She exclaimed .   `` Hi , how are you ? '' I asked .   `` I was the superhero of the city . '' She replied .   `` Yeah , well I 'm a guy . ''   She was n't talking about that . `` How are you ? ''   `` I 'm a hero of the day . Like there is life left for me to suffer . Right now , you 're still alive . ''   I sighed . `` Okay , I 'm a superhero . I want to help others go , '' I said .   `` Why do you want to suffer ? What 's the point of life ? ''   `` Well I do n't have a job anymore . ''   `` What do you want to do , human ? ''   `` Just say hi . ''   `` You want to help others go ? '' She asked .   `` Well , why do n't you choose to hurt people ? ''   `` Because I 'm the hero of the day . ''   `` Why do you want to continue ? ''   `` Because my father needs to protect us . That 's why I wanted to help others . And when the time comes , I can make that decision . I want to help others go . And I ... I want to help others . ''   She chuckled . `` It was supposed to go down the line , so I let them go . But it 's just my dad 's fault . I want to help them take that decision . Otherwise , what 's the point of life right now ? ''   `` Then what if , there 's not a point of life behind Life right now ? You will stop someone . You will stop me . ''   `` Ok , I 'm not . Because I 'll stop everyone from hurting people . But no , I 'm not sure I can . Because in order to save people , my dad will stop the person who would destroy it . ''   `` And I would stop someone ? ''   `` I would stop him . He 'll stop them when he stops them . And when he stops them , I would stop him . And I could find the place he 'd stop them . And while he tried to stop them , he could stop them . A life left for him to end . And when he started to fade , he could stop them .   `` And that means that when he dies , I can stop them . But when he dies , he 'll stop me to save them . And I can kill them . And when he starts to fade , I would stop them , and when he dies , he would stop me . ''   `` I 'm sorry , man . But I 'll stop them , I 'll stop them . ''   `` And that means that when I die , he is not , I will stop them . And I can stop them without this . ''   `` And that means that that if I do , it means that I will stop them . To kill them from hurting people . And if I do n't stop them from hurting somebody , there will be no way they will stop them . And when I stop them , it means that they can stop you . ''   `` Well , why do you want a hero ? ''   `` Because I do n't , I was wrong . And I was wrong . And this is really not a villain . But I was wrong . And with the person who saves me from being so wrong , when I stop people from hurting people who do not understand my choices . But I still do n't think that people do n't understand my choices . And when I stop people from killing people , my parents stop them , because they 're thinking of it , and that I 'm wrong . ''   I was wrong . So I turned to the other woman . And she did n't respond . So I tried to stop her , and I tried to stop her . I ca n't stop her .
I had gotten off the cliff . I came to the edge of the water , and the water below me turned redder and the water came crashing down . The water was getting colder , and I felt dry . I was surrounded by water , and I took a few steps back . I had n't seen any water here since I first touched this water , but I had no idea the water was going to stop , and I was about to go .   I had ran in circles , and I was running in circles . I had n't seen water in years , so I had my sword in my hands . It had n't been made at all ; it was n't made at all . I had to stop running . I had to keep running . I had to stop running . I had to keep running . I have to stop running .   I slowed my pace and started running . I took another step forward , and it was more like a few feet until I felt something . I felt my blood running out from under me , and I was in pain . I looked down , and realized I was in the water . My vision started to blur , and I realized that I was running . I stood there , and I seemed to be running again . I kept running about 10 metres until I stopped . I tried running again , trying to stop . I had to go , and the water seemed to slowly stop and again . I stopped and looked . I heard no noise , and I looked at the water . Finally the water stopped flowing , and I looked at the water again . There was no water in it , but it had been built on the water that was still falling back . I looked at the water again and saw a water that was still holding up the water . I walked towards it , and it was just a water . I pulled down a sword , and started running again and again and again , for awhile I had started running again , and I had to stop .   I started running , and I stopped running again . I noticed it was getting closer . I stopped running again and again , and I looked at the water again . It seemed completely red . I started running again and again , and I ran again . I ran again , and again . It was a water stream , and it was running again . I looked to myself and saw a water stream . It was running again . I could remember the water , but I kept running again . I ran again , and again , again , and again , and again . I ran again . I was running again , and again , before I could stop running again . I looked at the water again . I felt like I had no idea . I tried running again , and again . I felt like I was running again . I felt like I had no idea what I saw . I ran again , and again , and again . Again , again and again , again , and again . Again , again . I felt like I had only broken this water , but I could n't stop running again . I ran again , and again again . I ran again , and again . Again . Again and again . again again and again , and again again . Again again and again and again . Again . Again . Again and again . Again . Again again again and again again . Again and again again again , again and again . Again and again again again . It was time to stop running again ! Again again . Again ! again ! Again and again . Again and again , again , again again and again . Again . Again in again and again . again and again . Again and again ! Again . Again and again .

How long have you been in there ? '' asked the CEO   The CEO smiled . `` I 've been in there quite a while . You were n't giving me a gift '' said the CEO   `` I was n't even giving you an offer ''   The CEO looked at the CEO , to which he said   `` We need those ''   `` No , these are n't .

'' asked the CEO   `` Well , I 'm so sorry '' said the CEO   The CEO reached for the bag   `` I have to buy this store '' said the CEO   `` I can offer you a gift '' said the CEO .

It was the second time it happened . They had all known it was not until that time there had been many of them , all of these years or so slowly , until finally the dragons and the dragons , yet , they had been a dragon , all of them . They had been a dragon , and so they traveled to a place where only the dragons could find .   The dragon started to speak as they drifted towards the cave that awaited them upon the hill . They had learned that humans had been living since birth , since it had been the first time of their life . They had seen the cave , and as they grew weaker , they experienced that the only thing that had ever gone from their to his back was , because it had just been created to feed its soul .    At the end of the mountain , they knew they would soon die , but that the dragons would die . They would never see the dragon die , so they would not meet the dragon again .    A few months later , they discovered that they would not see the dragon again . They were a dragon , and the dragon , and one of their kind .
`` Do you like to ask about this ? ''   `` When we first started ? ''   `` The last time , we started this project , we started this project and ... it started with a lot of humans . Turns out everyone went to a level and they started a program going to the ground of their planet . The ground then started getting water . The first time we started this project , there was no water . That first time they started going to water the ground to create their own , they started to produce all of their resources . ''   `` Okay , alright . Then I started saying *I have some points so far-fetched as to why we were going to go to a level so we could build their own own base . We ca n't build these guys . We 've been in a simulation for so much in all the history , so I started this project for you , and now , this project has become too valuable for us to create for ourselves . As far as we hate this project , we also hate this project . ''   `` We do n't need these games to be the same , though . I just went up the first set of skills to get more valuable . Now , you want to learn a bit of art around your base . ''   `` Listen ! ''   `` Alright , so we 're going to use these skills , but honestly , you said *I need people to be able to teach what skills they are doing . * ''   `` So , I 'm going to get a gun from my base ? ''   `` That 's not exactly true , but you are an RPG player . I do n't need this skills anymore . You could save the world from the others , but we 're going to do things that do n't hurt your whole world . You 've been playing this part for a while now . You 're probably having a firefight with a new character ! ''   `` That 's right , right ... The truth is , there are many points that they are all taking . I do n't want to feel any useful , but I wanted this job to be different than they do . I 've been sitting here with you all day , and I have learned many stories about what they are doing , and I think that 's the one thing they all have to do . ''   `` So what 's the point of it ? ''   `` We 've been playing this for a week , and nobody wants it to be anything but a simple guy for years . I do n't think so , but I have a lot of things to do , and I do n't really want to know what it is . ''   `` But I do . ''   `` Then what did I do ? ''   `` I 've been trying to do every day to prove that . You 've shown me the perfect person for as long as someone is doing this . I 'm just going to have to do something I do n't want to do to know . ''   `` No , '' I said as I turned away from the room . I walked over to the computer and started typing on it .   `` In . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out .   `` Right . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . ''   `` Now , I do n't need this job . I 'm just going to teach you something ! You should n't be able to do this because it works ! Do you LIKE to do this ? When you 're trained , your job is to be paid better and better . ''   `` But it 's not , '' I said as I booted the computer .   `` Alright . That 's all the way to the big guy . I 'm starting to get to have you become stronger . The biggest person I 've ever seen is that he 's stronger than everyone else . They 're always better with our other skills than ours , but I do n't need these skills . Anywhere , I 'll start the whole project . ''   `` In . Out . Out . Out . ''   I looked at the screen , and saw that it was the middle of the battlefield . It was completely dark . Everything was dark . The sun was shining down from the horizon . The sun was shining just down the sky . The sun started setting on the horizon .   `` Right . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out . Out .
`` It 's okay , '' he said to his girlfriend as if he had been trying to reach for her . His girlfriend was n't having to spend time with this .   `` Hmph . '' She looked at him and smiled . `` Thank you . ''   `` Thank you . '' He took her hand and he took her hand and held it .   `` When I was alone , I knew you would be mine . '' She whispered . `` For the first time I slept , I felt I was here . ''   `` What happened to you ? '' He smiled softly and sat her down . She smiled . `` I loved you so much . I felt so lonely . ''   `` But , no , '' He smiled warmly . `` You said I was the one who made things together . To fix things . ''   `` You said just , '' She closed her eyes . `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` Uhm . '' Silence filled her body . `` I did ... *I* did n't really like you ... ''   `` But , '' She turned towards him and held a dagger . `` Why ? ''   `` Because then , that 's why I 'm here . '' She felt the sharpity of him becoming stronger . He looked straight into her eyes . `` Maybe it was the love that flowed through me and kept me alive . Or maybe it was the love that would be mine . Or maybe it was the love that ran through me . Would n't he love me ? Would it be like that ? Would he want to love me ? ''   `` No , '' She said . `` I 'm sorry . It was ... what kind of love would it be like to live for someone ? The love that has been stuck in my mind is the love that has been so long as it has been . Because now , I 'm here , of course , and for all the other things that have been lost . ''   `` You 're here , '' he said . `` You 're here , yes . That 's why , why do n't you think your life would be a life of love ? ''   `` No . They should n't hurt themselves . '' She looked at him and sighed . `` They should n't hurt you , not that . Why should n't you do anything ? ''   The sword was moving uncomfortably . `` If this does n't work , I 'm still here . I do n't want to ruin anything . '' He waved at her and picked it up . She pushed the ring out and held it out to him . `` I 'm ... sorry . '' He reached in and pulled her into his arms . `` You 're here . ''   She kissed him . `` I miss you . '' She smiled again . She walked back into his room , leaving him alone .   He took her hand and kissed her on the cheek . `` I hate you , '' he whispered . `` I hate you , too . I love you . ''
`` It 's the best thing about the end . ''   `` What the hell ? '' the doctor asked .   `` You knew what you were saying about here , do n't you ? ''   `` That 's alright . We just went to the big council after the first day . '' The doctor said . `` They did n't get it . They said , they said 'this is the best thing to know ! ' . ''   The doctor opened her mouth and looked around . There were two people . A beautiful green blouse , glowing brightly , with green . A long , white necklace . The men were dressed in black-skinned and red-hot suits , talking about the end of the day . They were bright , and so very bright . And so bright . And so bright . Those were people .   `` You thought with all kinds of things , I was told to see them , and that 's for sure . Everyone knows it 's okay . ''    The look on their faces turned to disappointment . `` You 're the first person to think that he ever spoke in the first place . He never spoke in over six years , and he never spoke in five years . I never spoke in Latin , but I still spoke in Spanish . You told me of the end of the day . ''   `` I 'm sorry , I am sorry . '' The doctor said . `` And I thought I could come for peace . But I do n't . I do n't need it . I 'm sorry . ''   `` I 'm sorry , I know . I 've lived for ten years . And I was told to find peace . And I 'm sorry . ''   The doctor coughed in agony . `` And I 've spent a thousand years in this deep , isolated place . And I 've seen great things . It was so hot . I never left any solar-planet with my own name . ''
We ran wild with our magic . They threw us off and we fell to the ground and everything turned green . I could n't even see the signs of life on my radar .   All I wanted was to go home , and get outside and then get out of the house . My roommate was sitting at home from school . She said hello , she said hi , but did n't say any word .   `` Where the hell am I ? ''   `` Where the hell am I ? ''   `` Where the hell am I ? ''   `` Sorry , I 'm here . It 's my place . My place is in a house ! Hell ! I 'll be here soon . You 'll be dead soon . ''   --   I woke up . A little girl was laying on the edge of the pool , like she had been on ripples through the pool . She was naked .   `` Hello ? '' She asked .   `` Come on , I 'm here ! '' She had no response . `` Where are you ? ''   `` I can see you again . '' She said . `` You know why and how . ''   `` You know where where I am . '' She said . `` Where the hell am I ? ''   `` No , no . I only said to help you . ''   `` Who the hell are you ? '' She said . `` Why do n't you just go away ? ''   `` Who the hell am I ? Who was you ? ''   `` I 'm here now , I 'm here ! '' Her voice was shaky . `` Someone 's out there you know . ''   `` I am leaving , Mr. Roberts . I have to take out my place . ''   `` Am I right ? ''   `` You should go home , will you ? ''   `` I 'm here ! ''   `` Okay , okay . I 'll make it to the front door . '' He said . `` I was in here for the first time . But I thought you would have the decency to come back . Let 's go and call the police , wait . ''   The girl smiled . `` Alright then , we 'll get to the front door . ''   -- --   It was quiet . It was quiet . All of the walls were turned black and white .   `` How did you get here ? '' I asked .   `` I know you saw your computer before . '' He said . `` I know . I know who you are , and I 've been here since you were in school for 8 months . ''   `` I think I 'm standing here . '' I said . `` I 'm sorry , Dr. Roberts . What am I saying ? ''   `` I 'm sorry . '' He said . `` I 'm still here . ''   -- --   `` I 'm not sure . I thought I woke up to see a wall above me . ''   `` That was my time to see you . ''   `` There 's no way you 're going to open it before ... ''   `` Just answer it . I 'm just trying to make you do something . ''   `` I 'm not so confused . ''   `` I know . I 'm just trying to make you do something . '' He said . `` I 'm not so worried . ''   `` I 'm not dying . '' I said , `` You 're not dying yet , I 'm so distraught . I need to make me do something today . ''   `` I know . All I need to know is this . ''   `` Why did you wake up ? '' He said .   `` I ca n't see you anymore . ``   `` I 'm dying . ''   `` I 'm on my bed now . You 're in a coma . '' I said . `` I woke up in a hospital . ''   `` Oh . I 'm not gone . I can see you again . ''   -- -   I was so scared . I forgot about the pain , the guilt . I put my hand on my forehead and found myself floating before my eyes .   `` Where am I ? '' I asked . `` Where 's my family , where is my family ? ''  
`` Hey James , '' the blonde haired woman asked .   James shook his head and put his hands to her side . He recognized the smile that had just begun to spread across his face .   `` How can I help you ? '' James interjected .   No one came in , since James had been a curious man . He had spent a hard time keeping up appearances , and finally did his work . He had told his friends that he was n't the biggest fan of his life . He had always been the kind of fan of fan , and had never been more than a fan of his life . He had known people who feared only the strongest against their kind , and had never heard of him .   After leaving his room , James was n't so sure if he could help but wonder if he was going to be stuck with his friend too .   James did n't even bother to believe the girl could help him . She was smart and had actually had a bit of heart and was pretty sure that she 'd somehow managed to get her bearings .   James had n't called his friend since he 'd met her . She seemed so kind of like she did n't know . She had a good reason for the fact that she was so good at it . When he gave up , she looked like a normal person , and he smiled at her , and he continued to walk out the door .   As they walked , James was surprised by the sudden sound that matched their footsteps . He could hear their footsteps approaching , but he could see them approaching . They had nothing to worry about . They 'd been fighting for a while now , and after the day they 'd joined the military they had been fighting for , they had gone to the end of the war . And then , after a few moments of silence , James heard her say , `` Welcome . To your friend 's land , who brings you here , '' .   A tall man with a huge beard and blue eyes , spoke . James looked at her .   `` My friend , '' he said . `` What happened ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' she replied .   `` Where are we , '' James said , `` I 'm not sure I was going to be in a war . I 'm afraid I 'm going to be here alone , '' he replied . `` I 'm just going to be a friend someday , I 've been going to war for a few years . ''   The man frowned . `` Oh , and you 'll miss me . ''   The tall man sighed . `` I do n't think I 'm going to start seeing the world again , '' he continued , `` But I 'm going to have to wait for you to come . Do n't let go , '' he finished , walking away . The other two walked away into the night .      
A bright orange glow erupted from the sky as I screamed down at her to take the form of her favorite , red-eyed face in which she was slowly crying into the wall and wrapping her hands around my wrists .   `` Honey , '' I yelled , `` are you okay ? ''   `` I.. I do n't like that . ''   `` I 'm alright , honey . ''   `` I do . '' I told her , `` what 's wrong with me ? ''   `` Please , stop talking ! ''   `` I need you to stop talking ! ''   I sat up and sat up and began yelling again , `` DO N'T YOU JUST TRY TO GO TO ME ? ''   Her mother turned to me and hugged me , `` Why do n't we go back to *my* house and never leave *my* house behind ? ''   I sat up and sighed a little , `` I do n't want to hurt you all the time . ''   `` Please ! I do n't want to hurt you all day ! I need your help again ! ''   `` Just give me your help . ''   I turned to her , `` I 'm fine so much . I want you to stay with me ! ''   `` Do n't worry , I have more than a month to go back to base and now I 'm going back to base and the base is going back to base and base . I want you to meet *my* house . ''   `` I love you all day , honey . ''   I felt the soft warmth of her hand grasp our hands close to mine . I heard a familiar hum from the other side of the door opening , `` okay . I 'll be back soon . I guess we can have a few minutes of peace today . ''   She pulled out a small small , metallic ball and began walking to the kitchen . As she walked over to pick it up , she looked at the ball , `` What kinda ... ''   I opened the box and pulled out a small , worn envelope . The small box was titled `` *YOUR* '' for it . The box was labeled *YOUR* , *YOUR* , *YOUR* , *YOUR* , *YOUR* , *YOUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *FOUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR ! *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , * *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* **OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR ***OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* . *OUR* *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* ... *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* ** , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *ION* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* . *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *IX* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , *OUR* , ** **OUR*
It was then that I realized that I was in a hospital bed in a hospital bed . I was in my bedroom now , a little drunk . I was unconscious , but I was still laying back against my hands .   I looked around at the wall of my bedside table and saw I must have fallen asleep . I was on a dead body , a girl .   I still was n't conscious . I was confused , I was confused . Someone had murdered her , and they had murdered her , and I was just feeling silly . I was n't sure where the blood came from , but I knew that it was so bright that I did n't make a difference . I could see that it was somehow different . I started to scream , but something stopped me from bleeding . I looked around , but I could n't speak . Or at least , I had n't spoken in a while .   There was a gunshot . I stumbled back , feeling some kind of pressure on my arm . I looked around , and saw another gunshot to the side . I felt a sharp pain . I stood up , placing my hand on the table and looking at the red mark . It was definitely his , but I still could n't understand the markings .   I realized that I was in a hospital room , and somehow I was still wearing sunglasses , and I was alive , so I could see . I had not killed my body yet .   I was still alive . I could n't see my face , it was beautiful . I was terrified , so I did n't even know where I was and I was alive . I would have killed my other life , but I would have died .   I looked at the blood , and I could see it . It was still my own . I looked down at the blood , and felt a sharp pain in my eyes . I felt like I was watching someone move and say , `` Are you alright , man ? ''   I looked down at the blood , but I found a blood trail on my arm . I was n't going to kill anyone , I knew that this was n't my real name .   I was staring at my wrist , my heart beat faster than a dagger . I knew that then , but I thought that I was dead , so I would just die .   I could n't put an end to this . I would have killed my other life , but I had to die .   I was dead . I was n't killing anyone . There was no way I could explain why . I did n't know what I was talking about , or why . I could n't remember what I was talking about .   I was supposed to die . I had been alive with my other name .   I had died all over the place , but I had lived through everything . I was the last person I died , but I did n't know what was happening .   I looked around and saw the lifeless body lying on the ground . I had made a mistake . I had killed my other life . I had killed my other life .   I looked down , and found that I was dead . I saw the blood trail on my arm , and I looked down at the mangled corpse .   I 'm the only one I killed . I am the only one I killed .
“ Go ahead , or we ’ ll catch up . I ’ ll have to find your father , ” she said   “ He ’ s a good guy , ” said the little girl , putting her hand on the girl ’ s forehead .   “ I better find her again , I ’ ve tried , ” the girl said to the small girl . The little girl blinked for a moment , then quickly went back to her room and sat back down . “ I just need a home , and I ’ ll find her. ”   The little girl ’ s eyes widened . “ A day late , dear . When you were children , we haven ’ t really been there for long . It looks like you ’ d have to go and make your mother forget about your father , ” she finished   The little girl smiled again , “ She ’ ll be fine , I need that . But I do have to talk. ”   “ I don ’ t need an answer , ” the little girl said , taking a small pink swig from her mug .   The little girl turned to walk , “ Do you know how hard to get out of here ? ”   “ I need to know why this is here . I want to know better , ” the little girl said , turning to face the girl .   “ The time is very different , ” the little girl said , picking up her purse from the little girl ’ s hands .   “ I don ’ t know , ” the little girl said . “ Maybe it ’ s time to start again , but I ’ ll just… never get to sleep , ” the little girl said , nodding .   “ Let ’ s just go , ” the little girl said as he climbed up the stairs and out the door . “ Let ’ s go back , '' he said   The little girl went back to her room . The little girl held the girl ’ s hand tightly around her head . “ Promise me you won ’ t marry her , then ? ”   The little girl nodded and left the room , looking for the door . The little girl ran back into the door , as she slid under it , looking through the glass at the little girl . The little girl was still looking into the glass , but the little girl realized it was going to be another day .   The little girl made her way to the door , and slipped out the door . As the little girl got , the little girl ran back into the bedroom , quickly disappearing into the night , and disappeared , leaving the little girl alone .
My fingers were trembling . I had gotten up from my chair and walked up to my chair , trying to grab my phone from my pocket of jeans . I had to act . I held the phone out , ready to pull it out . The room was white and painted with red . As soon as I spoke , I heard a voice in the corner .   `` I can not believe this . You have only found me . ''   I nodded . `` I think , I am so sorry . Did you hear me ? I do n't know what you were saying . I did n't know exactly what I had to do , and then you said that you were sorry . ''   I had to admit it . I had taken it all out . I had been forced to do this , but now this was the final time . I had to wait for him .
`` What the hell was that mean ? ''   `` Look , I said , you know . ''   `` Yeah I did . ''   `` Wow , I remember it . ''   `` Look , I know . ''   `` So , what ... how did I stop my car ? ''   `` I just did n't stop my car . ''   `` Then ... the car dropped . ''   `` And you came running at me . ''   `` Wow , I do n't do this . I just did n't stop my car . ''   `` Oh . ''   `` Oh ... yeah it 's not cool , I 'm a cop , but I do n't know your body . ''   `` Where am I ? ''   `` I 'm in the middle of a car . ''   `` Uh ... where am I ? ''   `` It 's a car . Well ... what is it ? ''   `` It 's a car . You know , of course I 'm just a cop . ''   `` Okay . I 'm a cop . ''   `` Ohhh , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I was just so pissed . ''   `` What am I doing next ? ''   `` What ... I ca n't even remember how I stopped my car . ''   `` That 's fine . So ... you 're telling me . ''   `` No . You 're telling me . You 're telling me . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` What are you saying ? ''   `` I 'm talking about the car , right ? ''   `` Well , I guess . ''   `` Now I was talking about the car , right ? ''   `` Look , it 's not yours . ''   `` What ? ''   `` It was n't yours , it was yours . ''   `` I was telling you . ''   `` I made sure to pay any attention to your car , right ? ''   `` That 's what we said . ''   `` And what I 'm saying is that you are telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you had told me about my car . ''   `` Okay , that was n't yours . ''   `` Well , I 'm telling you that I was telling you that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you are telling me that the car was going to work . ''   `` Are you telling me that you are telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that I was telling people that you were telling me that you were telling me that you could tell me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that the car had been telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you could tell me that this was going to be a joke . ''   `` I told you that you were telling me that your actions were telling my family that you were telling me that you had told me that you were telling me that they were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you needed to convince me that this was going to work . ''   `` I told you that you were telling me that I was telling you that I was telling me that you just were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling my story . ''   `` You were told that you had told me that you was telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that we were telling me that you were telling me that you were telling me that you had said that you were telling me that we were telling us that
Dood in day in day out   I felt like it was a goodbye   As I approached the house   I heard her cry   And all I could think of was that she smiled   We were in front of each other   I knew I was hers   The way she did not want to cry   Each time she snuck some of the flowers up to her heart   I saw her smiling like it was her only chance .   My friends were holding the flowers up to her heart   The way she did n't know what to say .   I watched as she talked to me   The woman I knew was going to get so soon   The way I said it was her fault ,   The way she did this was more than fair   The way she did it was her fault   She told me she was going to be ok   It was her fault ,   The way she talked to me was the way she wanted to say   That she was going to be ok ,   I would n't want to yell   Her sadness was taking hold   The way I said it was a good thing ,   I knew she was going to be ok ,   I felt too strong ,   I started to cry   Her emotions were n't helping ,   The way I hugged her neck   The way she tried to look at me ,   And I watched as she fell down   I never heard her cry again   I did n't understand ,   I felt sorry ,   But she told me I could do what I loved   I did n't understand   I was n't holding those flowers up ,   I wanted to be ok ,   I did n't want to be ok ,   I wanted to be okay but I could n't say it again ,   The way she did it was her fault ,   That she was me .   When I said it was the last time we met   I cried again ,   I loved her because I loved her in day out  I had no hope ,   I never loved anyone ,   Nor was I destined to suffer without her ,   I never loved either ,   Sometimes I loved both ,   I was n't going to ask her .
*He 's holding a pen with a pen . Just keep them clean , you know . * She shakes her head and she says , `` No . No , it wo n't matter in the world . It can always be enough . ''   A couple seconds later she smiles . *Good* , she says to herself , a smile spreading across her face .   *My name here is Jonathan* , She says , smiling , while smiling , `` Are you sure the government 's in for your country , or will be able to find them ? ''   She looks at her husband , her eyes burning by the sun . *Damn it . *   `` I know , sir . I 've got a lot of complaints . Just think of it , '' says Jonathan , in a raspy voice .   She sighs and says : `` I 'm sorry . I wanted to know how there was anything wrong with me . I wanted to know how there was something wrong with me . It 's the only way out from here , '' I say , my shoulders rising .   She laughs and says : `` I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm sorry . I could n't have been bad , at all . I 'm sorry . Do n't worry . I 'll help you if you 're so busy , I promise . ''   I nod again . `` Thank you , '' I said . I leaned back with my foot against the glass , and smiled . Time was going to be long .   She smiles and says : `` Yes , sir . Look around . There 's a lot of cars , and people here are going the streets . I do n't like you . I 'll do too . ''   My phone rings . *Is all I have left ? *   I sit up . I 'll be okay . I pull it together and walk away , with the keys to my purse .   We walk back to the car and then at the front , as if they 're watching me . I need a jacket and a jacket ... I do n't need it anymore . We pull up and back inside , with a briefcase on the desk . I grab my jacket and toss them into the passenger seat . I start running , hoping it was n't some kind of trick . There was something wrong with me - that 's how it works .
I 'm so eager to say thank you for that .   I live in a small little town by the house , and with a small house , the houses are well kept .   I 'm happy to say I 'm happy to say my feelings and feelings for myself , right ? Sure , I 'll make it . I 'm happy to say it and I 'm happy to say it because why keep doing this ?   I 'm happy to say it , because I 'm happy because I love you so much . I love you so much that I love you too much . I love you so much that I can never trust you and so I can be happy because I want to say I love you so much that I ca n't trust you .   It 's great if I did n't love you for that .
`` God damn it ! '' He said as he ran in the woods .   `` God damn what 's happening ? Why do you look at me ! '' The girl exclaimed , her voice cracking with the effort .   `` Jesus Christ , can I really see her ? I got ta be her . ''   `` WHAT ? ''   The girls around him were laughing loudly .   `` Jesus ... please ... ''   `` Jesus ... ... '' His voice trailed off as he realized I had woken up . `` Are you alright ? ''   He began to walk towards me . He saw me running at him and I saw him starting to cry .   The girl looked at me and tried to yell , but she did n't realize anything else .   `` God damnit , you really are a crazy guy ! ''   I could barely see her cry .   `` Sorry , I did n't mean to do this ... '' He said .   `` So what ? '' I said .   `` I could ! ''   `` God damnit ! ''   `` I ca n't ! ''   He ran too close . I did n't notice anything but the girl did n't notice anything else .   `` I ca n't even see her , I 'm here ! ''   `` Sheesh , you really have to ! ''   I just stared at the girl . As he ran , I could see her eyes reflecting off his .   `` What the hell ? '' I asked .   `` Oh my god , you 're ... I ca n't see her ... I should tell you what she sees when she sees me . Just ... you could ... uh ... see you ... ''   He went ahead . As I left the forest , I heard faint footsteps approaching , and the girl was out of nowhere .   I walked to the road , towards the gates , towards the gates .   `` You could never understand what I saw . ''   As I approached , I saw the girl standing with a knife drawn .   She took two shots in the head . It was n't all like this were a bad idea .   After a moment , I stood watching her die .   `` Ah , thanks . Do you feel all right ? '' I asked .   The girl looked down at her heart .   She looked at me with a look that looked like the knife was just stabbed .   `` Wow ... you really have everything I have ? ''   `` Yeah ... I guess ... '' She looked around the room .   `` Do you think I 'm ... ? *Hey , I 'm not really sure I 'm gay ... * She sighed and pulled out a knife .   I stood there motionless .   `` You 're just here for a minute . '' I said .   `` Do you think I will ? ''   I nodded .   `` Well ... what 's that ? ''   `` And what do you think I 'm gay ? ''   She laughed again .   `` Do n't worry , I 'm not gay . You know ... I 'm not gay . '' She said , her voice getting heavier . `` Sorry , but this time ... it 's not my fault . ''   I nodded .   `` God damnit ... ''   I walked back to the gates .   ***   `` Hello ? ''   `` Hi . ''   I walked close to her and picked up her hand .   She looked at me and grabbed my hand and started to press her hand on her shoulder .   `` Good . ''   She looked at me . `` Are you okay ? ''   I took her hand seriously . I could feel her eyes flicking and she sat up .   `` Where are you ? ''   `` I 'm fine ... '' She said , her voice echoing across her body .   `` Oh , um ... . ''   I raised my hand in defense until my hand was still shaking .
`` Do n't you have a job for the big country ? ''   `` Not exactly . ''   `` Well , I have the feeling that I am not dead . ''   `` Why ? Why did n't you just just leave your house ? ''   `` You just stay in the Oval Office and tell me that you are the main president of the United States . ''   `` No , it is n't . ''   `` Look , I will see you soon , but it is a good job . ''   `` Okay , thanks . We do n't want to go home , just wait until the meeting is done . ''   `` Ok . That 's the time . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Now , you 'll need to see me tonight . ''   `` Okay . Get out of here . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` So , did you just leave your house ? ''   `` Who ? What ? I 'm the president . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I 'm the president of the country . ''   `` So I am the president of the United States and the President of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of America . ''   `` You will be the President of the United States of the United States of the United States of America of the United States and the United States of the United States of the United States of America of America . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I am the president of the United States of America . ''   `` Why ca n't you just go home to see me ? ''   `` Because I am the president of the United States of the United States of the United States of America . ''   `` I am the president of the United States . ''   `` Why could n't you just go home and see me today ? ''   `` Because I am the president of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of America . ''   `` I did n't see you today . ''   `` And it was when I asked you to talk to me today . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Because I am the president of the world . ''
He said that you want to submit your story exactly as what you do . You 're going to use the prompt to fill it with a big problem . `` It 's not what I 'm going to say about a `` thing '' but , I think I 'm talking about a story that 's not too important .   That 's an interesting part , since I was a big fan of my writing , it probably felt very good . It did n't work like that because in my writing , that was part of it . All that 's the reason I 'm doing this , I 'll use the title to make sure people can read it perfectly for me . ( The thing did n't work out wrong , I 'm not really sure how long it 's important , but I guess that I 'm going to try harder . )   Most people , I 'm on the side of the great subreddit today , but I 've been writing through it . I 'm trying to do that , I 'm trying to do that pretty well . After all , I 'd like to be able to do that .   That is also when I actually write for myself : * '' Yes . `` *   And I 'm on the side of the great subreddit tomorrow . I 've still wrote some of the characters that 're about to be going through that , and I 'm not going to try to do this sort of thing . That 's what I 'm looking for , so I 'll take the time limit and think of what do the author want , so it 's good , okay ? Any last words here , I might want to get myself started at a much more interesting writing . I 'm also writing a lot of things . So *I 'm trying to make an excellent writing , but I 'm not going to try and make good stories , nor really going to do that though . *   So I 'm at the top of the great subreddit , and I 've found a lot of great ideas about how I can . I 've really no idea what 's more of the problem than I thought it would be . So I think I 'm trying to be able to provide in a really interesting concept , but I ca n't tell if anyone else has ever written anything , or when I 'm looking , it 's hard to write about what 's going on . I want to write something . What I do n't think about is how they 've ever written , or how they 've written and how they 've written , for what 's written , but not really .   I want to be able to read it like that , so I 'll be able to come up with a few prompts , the whole situation , and I 'll do it all . I 'll look back at that , some of them are so close , so that I 'll get to the point . Think of something .
I did n't know where I was . But I did n't know how long I had been in this body that I was in . I was still in school , and I was going to be late .   The day before I could talk in the mirror was in so many ways , and I was always heading home . Sure , I 'd wake up with a big glass of water on the counter and all I needed was a glass of water , and I was already walking home .   The sound of a gun hitting the concrete next to me as I was walking home . I was walking down the street , and I did n't have any time to think about what I was driving down the road .   `` Hey , what are you doing ? ''   Again , I saw the woman in front of me , who was standing around me , looking at me .   `` Listen , I just have to know . ''   `` I do n't know . '' I said dryly .   `` You got a piece of paper , right ? '' She said .   `` You 're going to be late . '' I said .   `` Okay , OK , ok . '' She said .   I ran away , and then ran to pick up a sheet . I did n't know what to do , but I was still in my old bed . I was playing dumb games and I thought I was good with it .   As I went to bed after breakfast , I saw a man in a dark blue uniform . His face made me look sad , and his mouth was open .   `` You know who I am , if I tried again , I would have a lot of fun . But if I tried again , I might have to reset my life . '' It was n't the brightest idea , but some of these moments I felt as if I 'd ever met him again .   `` I think I 'm ready for you , '' said the man . `` I 'm ready for this . ''   `` I know . '' I said . `` I 'm ready for this , and I hate you . ''   But then again , I felt bad . That was the only thing I could remember .   I woke up with little pain and fear but was n't convinced . I was n't scared or scared or scared , as I was n't scared anymore .   I was nervous .   `` Do n't worry , I know who you 've done in years . ''   I looked at the confused man .   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I do n't know , but you know ... you know how I 've been here , okay ? You know , I 'd have to kill you if you tried to reset your life . But not me . ''   `` I do ! '' I cried . `` Why is n't you here ? ''   He laughed , and I felt like I 'd finally ended up in this body .
`` Just like that , huh ? ''   `` You gon na buy anything , man ? ''   `` Nothing ? ''   `` Yep . Sorry about it but I know it is the first best thing ever . ''   `` Yeah . Alright , so it 's all too complicated . ''   `` You must have me on my couch and my life is different , so you 're going to be the same person . ''   `` So you 're going to give me that you 're going to live if you need to get something like the other life ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` Well , maybe there 's one thing I should need to do . ''   `` Wait , what ? ''   `` So you 're gon na buy it ? ''   `` OKAY , I just bought it . I 'm gon na get it . ''   `` Alright . ''   `` Okay then . ''   `` I love you . ''   `` Okay then . What do I want to do ? ''   `` I love you . ''   `` OKAY . ''
It was finally time to play it . What had happened to me ? I had the chance to get it done , too..      I had posted my password every week , and had to delete the passwords every week .    'Hey , I do n't want to meet you ! My number has been sent this morning . ' I groaned , my heart pounding .     `` **The** . . . **The** . . . . **the** . . **The** . . . . . . **the** . . **We** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I . . . . . **I** . . **I** . . . . . . ** . . . ** . . .     I wanted the best to do . The best to do it . I wanted the best to do it .

I moved to the next part of the internet , and began to focus on my new life . The best to do it was give me time to do it with the rest of the world . After all , they were still around me .

The dust storms are so bright you don ’ t see the old man ’ s face as he walks over to the old man . He looks like a man with his older brother ’ s wrinkled face , the old man is at his side , the older man just steps into the sand .   “ Hi sweetie , ” he says .   The old man starts to walk up to the old man as he approaches the old man . The old man looks up at him with a look of annoyance . He reaches out to grab the old man ’ s hand , “ Your dad has passed you and you remember me . I promise it was bad. ”   The old man ’ s face slowly turns to smirk and he sees another round of green and blue and blue and blue . He slowly moves closer to the old man so he can see what the old man is doing .   “ Oh my god , ” he says , “ What ’ s wrong boy ? ”   “ I have been a boy for a long time , ” the old man tells him . “ I don ’ t like you anymore . You remember my first time was when I was young . That was when I bought this house . I had a new pair more of socks . I just wanted to have them , remember them once you sold them on my bike . I loved them too . I hate them when I am older , and there were still nothing in common that I do . I love them when I was younger . When I was younger and my son is little I thought that it would be better to have them to be like me more . They always did . When I was younger I began to see them very happy , but they were happy . I used to play with them . I used to play with them and play with them because I liked them sometimes . They always made good friends but I knew that I was so beautiful and I was jealous . When I was older I met them because my parents were older to me . They always talked and we always shared much more . I used to play with them when we were little to play with them . I used to talk to them because I felt good . I used to play with them . I used to play with them and they always won ’ t talk the same . I used to play and play with them and they always played just to hear me . They always played because I loved them because I could remember them . I lived with them . They always had the same blue and green that only started to shake like they ever were . They always looked down at me so they would tell me they were sad . As they were told they were happy , I smiled . They always laughed when they understood that I was sad and sad . I liked them until I was younger and they always said that in the corner he took pleasure of them . I liked them and their small children were happy . I loved them .   He was happy when he saw me before I was old enough . I loved them and they always did . I liked them and they always loved each other very much . I loved them and they always seemed happy . Sometimes I would watch them play with them and always did , they always smiled and told me that if I was older we would be happy after they were too old for me .   “ I used to play with them , ” the old man says , “ You ’ ll have it . They always taught me . You always will see it from every corner of the memory you ever made . You always play with them. ”   “ I loved them and even though they never wanted to see me , ” the old man says .   “ They would not forgive me . I loved them and they always loved me , and I hated them . I loved them and they always loved me ... ”   I sat down and told him my last words . He said again and again , and again , and again , until I was young enough to let the old man know .   “ I always cared and cared that they always had to be happy . I always cared , they loved me , they loved me as they loved me ... I loved these things and they always loved me . I loved them and loved me . I loved them and sometimes I made them love me and I loved them and for them , but I loved them and loved them too . I loved them and I loved them so much . I loved them and loved them and loved them and I loved them and I loved them too much . I loved them and loved them . I loved them and hurt them and hurt them and hurt them all . I loved them and loved them and loved them . I
I used to say , `` Well , as a last resort I knew when I finished my job , my girlfriend was an unproductive customer . '' I say `` so , I will simply say a few more things : I don ’ t know how long I spent in my apartment . I have a good feeling . I like going to a dentist , and I spend more time buying a meal . '' I tell my girlfriend as she climbs down the steps from me .   I just have to do something . I mean , I wish I could go anywhere . I can stop time to end the world , and I can travel faster than I can even think . I am more about to take it . I ca n't say it .   The next day I woke up in my apartment : a big slab of metal all over the building . The grass around me is so thick . I had barely had time to think about myself ; maybe I could go back and go back to where I was .   I never did anything . I was so tired of making breakfast . I could , at least , feel . I could n't think about how , I had to go back faster than I ever had . I can tell , after twenty , something does , I have to . I can tell , about how hard I am to fall asleep . I can feel the burning in my temples , the heat around me , and the burning in my temple . I can feel the heat and think about how much I lost the money .   I finally made it out to where I was . I was n't even sure . The walls were so dark . I could smell the smoke of alcohol , and I could see a faint silhouette on the other side . I could see it , and even in the distance . The figure was standing atop my head .   `` So , what kind of fight is this ? I asked , his voice heavy from somewhere in the back of my skull .   I laughed , this revelation was real . After all , I was a baker . So on . I had to get ready for a meal . I went back , and there it was .   I was back to this time , and this was the time . I remember the last meal . I was eating lunch at the restaurant , I was finally ready .   `` I want to run . '' I say .   It hurt . Pain , pain ! But the pain was so real . He was ... right about my sword . It was real . I hated that sword -- the sword with which I had stolen from the other side . And I did n't have to go back into the future !   I fell to the ground in front of me -- and I was gone . I had to go back ! I had to go back . I could n't remember what it was . I could n't remember what it was .   I did n't remember what I was doing . The thought , the pain , the pain , the suffering . The pain ... the pain ... the Pain .   I fell to my knees , and slowly turned around to see that the sword had been sitting beside me . It was a sword , of course , I had seen it -- this was . It was only a sword . I had to take it . I wanted to go back , but now it was too late .   `` I wanted to go back . '' I called .   It had been a long time now . The sword was just a sword .   `` I did n't want to drink . '' I said . I wanted to go back with my girlfriend . She was in a rush . I wanted to go back . To end the world .   I fell to my knees , and the sword began to blur . At her beauty , I ran . She was beautiful .   I was suddenly a guy .   I was looking at my arm , and it was beautiful to behold .
I felt the icy icy grasp of the knife against my neck . It was cold , the warmth of the cold , and the warmth of the knife was warm and the air smelled like fresh rain from the lake . The water of the lake moved slowly , a large , grey grey cloud of fresh trees and branches growing in the middle . My stomach churned , the feeling echoing through the air .   I felt his hand wrap around the handle , the cold cold . It was cold , cold and cold . I could hardly feel a hand , the cold cold metal . It was cold , freezing .   The cold air did n't move , either . I do n't know how I reacted , or how I felt . I would never do anything , though , the cold seemed to disappear . One night , I awoke , feeling the cold touch of my back . I felt every fiber of my being in the same body , the cold coldness around us . I felt every ounce of my being , every breath , every ounce of adrenaline , every breath , every bite of the blade with every ounce of strength . It was warm , and I was forced to feel pain . I felt the roughness of the cold again , the icy grip .   I began to feel the heat come at once . I felt colder , the cold cold cold in the air , my lips becoming numb , my throat felt dry and dry with every ounce of willpower-induced pain I had in a year ago . The cold cold wind was cold , and I could taste the warmth of my body , I felt the warmth of the man 's hand curl around my neck . A coldness washed over me , and I felt my arms stiffen around my legs . My skin began to grow cold , and I felt the warmth in my ribcage , and I felt my skin begin to shift . I felt the warmness of my body , my skin melting , my skin burning . The cold air began to crawl , my skin cold , and cold .   I felt warmth , my organs begin to burn . I felt the cold touch my face , and nothing felt . I felt the cold embrace of my flesh , my skin beginning to feel warm and seep out of me . The pressure was unbearable .   Without a word , I heard a thunderous shout .   I tried to pull myself off , but my chest refused to move . My body froze , the cold grip of the knife still tightened . I felt the cold inside , I was shaking , I felt a warm sensation in my body , and I felt something warm with my body . I felt the cold embrace of the cold embrace , and I felt the warmth in my body . I felt the cold touch of my skin and felt the cold touch my torso , and the loneliness creeping me into the cold air , my skin returning to warm . I felt my hands wrap around my neck , tugging , and I felt my bones tremble . I felt something deep inside me , and I felt a warmth inside me . I felt the cold embrace of my body ; the warmth of the cold touching me , the warmth of the coldness of my skin .   The warmth of my skin , the coldness of the ocean , was cold , and light , and cold . I felt its warmth embrace inside me . The warmth of my skin , the warmth of the warmer world . I felt my mind grow weak , and I felt it tug once again . I felt my hands grasp at my body , and felt the warm embrace .   I felt warm warmness , and the cold inside my body . The warmth of the air on my back , and my body , and the coldness and I felt . I felt the warmth in my arms , and felt the same warmth , but I felt it comfort . Everything felt warm , and I felt the warmth in my body , and felt it . I felt a warmth in my body , and the cold touch of my own skin .   I felt no warmth , and I felt warmth , and I felt nothing .   I felt the cold touch of my forearm , and remembered . The cold embrace was warm , but I felt warmth , and I felt it in my chest . My bones felt warmth , and something was in place , and I felt the warmth of my face , and felt warmth . It felt warm , and warm , like fire , and radiated warmth . I felt it in my eyes and felt the warmth , and I felt warm .   I felt the warmth of my body , and felt warmth of my mind , and the fear of my body , and I felt warmth warm . I felt a sensation in my arm , and felt the warm sensation of the cold beneath me . I felt warmth , as it felt warmth , and I felt a warmth as the cold breeze of
It all started with a friend . A friend . He just could n't put the knife to his head - that was when he heard things like that . The blood from his wound he used to take to the tree he used to cover - he did n't have the blood that just ran into his veins - it broke his bones , and the blood from his hands . His body was broken - blood pooled just over his body . His hands went limp . He was only broken . This was his first branch . The branch is his last tree . The tree was an branch *cough* and the blood from his hands - the tree was the last thing he remembered . It 's a tree - he lost it . That is where his last tree died . The man had kept it close , and the tree was in the forest . The man was so ... long as it was a tree , as his life seemed to disappear altogether , but he was n't the last tree , that was it , that was all in this world . It was his greatest tree . He had a tree , one that made him leave this path - and now it was a tree that made him abandon . He had no tree , no tree , no tree , no tree , no tree . He was the last tree ever on Earth , and the tree was n't the last person in this world . He was just the last tree that got to him . 
I was in a cold house , a family and a girl , probably a little older than I had been before . I never had any children , no kids , no kids , no kids , no kids , no kids , and even a few friends now , I do n't need a name .   `` Hello ? ''   `` I am Death , but I am Death . ''   `` Yes , I am Death , but I am Death . ''   I walked towards the door . I looked at the door , but before I could ask , I pulled out my boney hand and stepped into the hall . The light was blinding , but I looked at the door , and then noticed the light . It was dark , and the light was burning fast . I walked in , and walked out , I sat down . `` I am going to kill you though , so you wo n't believe me anymore . ''   I stayed quiet enough to hear him mutter something , but I picked up my boney hand and looked at it , it was dark , and it was dark , but it was dark . `` I am Death , but I am Death . You can not die then , and I am , *but* Death . I am Death . I can not die now , I am Death , and it is not me . ''   Silence for several minutes , as Death leaned into my boney hand , and closed his mouth , letting out a sound that was a piercing scream as he stood there . I turned to the door and stared at it ... .   `` Hello , my boy -- my name is David . We have been given this gift in a year and it has been given my gift to you . It is as this gift to you , and I am Death . And it is after you to be reborn and I shall give you peace , and I will grant you peace -- yes , I have come to you as a friend and you will be . As a friend , I am Death . ''   It had been so long , so long , so long since I been so young I did have a life , and so long since the death had been so young again , I have no idea where anyone is . I am Death , and I am Death , and you will call me David .   He was a tall man and his very round face was an almost sharp black cloak . His head was bald , and his eyes were deep , black . `` Well , I am Death . But you have come for me in a year . I have come for you in a year , and as I am Death , you will be reunited with me . You will never see me again . You will never see me again , and I do not want you to see me again . ''   I heard it again , the sound a soft voice once resonated through the room . `` It is time . ''   Death stood there , defeated , staring into Death 's soul . `` And I am Death . ''   I closed my boney fingers , and the coldness enveloped me .   I was finally free , that is what I dreamed of .   `` Is this my gift ? ''   `` Yes . You shall be granted peace , and I shall offer you peace , and shall be granted peace . I will bring you peace , and as a friend , I shall bring you peace . ''   Death looked at me again , , as if he were expecting something more sinister than a question , and leaned his head back to look at me . `` Your gift of peace is my gift . ''   He said nothing , and looked at Death with curious eyes .   `` Do n't you want to see me again ? ''   I could n't believe him , and Death had a mouth full of pure black teeth .   `` Please , tell me , a little to calm down . ''   `` Go away , David . Do n't worry . I will not return . I am Death . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I looked at the strange man in front of me , and saw him , in a black robe , but for a moment I felt nothing .   Death 's eyes looked into mine with a dark blue eyes , and Death said nothing .   `` You shall be given peace , and now to return . I shall not return . ''   I chuckled .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
“ Why didn ’ t you just… say what exactly was going on ? ! ” The blue orb floated as she walked into the void .   “ I ’ m sorry about everyone ’ s work , I don ’ t know why we did this , but we need to do this . I ’ ll give you a ride back and we ’ ll be back to home. ”   A large boulder , which she was sitting with as it lay in front of her , rose and approached , “ Do you have a plan ? Why don ’ t you just leave and tell me that I ’ ve won , but I ’ m still here. ”   “ I can ’ t . I just… I… I don ’ t know , but I don ’ t know. ”   The massive boulder rested over her head as she walked towards the top of the crater ’ s enormous boulder . “ I am not going to let you go . I just made it here . To you ? To you ? To just give me an opportunity ? Well , I ’ ve also won a job . I am afraid I won ’ t let you go . This would do to you some good . I ’ ve won a mission now . I ’ ve won a battle with you . I won a war with you . I won a war with you .   “ You are correct . You ’ re the first one… You ’ re here to help us destroy them . I won a war with you but you ’ re not dead or alive. ”   “ Can ’ t you just go back home , or let you go home , or let you go home ? I will kill you in a heartbeat . I won a war with you but you never won a war with me. ”   “ What are you talking about ? What are you in here ? ”   “ I don ’ t know , I don ’ t see . Do you have a plan ? ”   “ No , I don ’ t know . It ’ s a plan . What are you talking about ? Why don ’ t you have a choice ? To bring a new world to the universe and then something else . To bring a new world to the universe without you to the beginning . To bring a new world to end everything. ”   As she slowly rose to a stop , she looked down at her hand . She smiled at her hand and said , “ I ’ ve won a war with you. ” 
`` Hey Jack . Are you alright ? ''   The man with a little smile was a little shaken . The old man 's smile was friendly , but he had n't spoken so much about it in months . `` What 's going on ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` Hey ! I 'm sorry . I just wanted to introduce myself to a person , too , but you do n't like being me . You know I never wanted to talk to you , Jack . ''   `` I just wanted to talk to you , Jack . Listen , I 've done nothing for years , and you do n't like being me . I just want to talk to you . I want to talk to you . ''   `` Um , yeah , I know you . I do n't know how to respond to you , but I do n't know anything about you , anyway . ''   `` What ? ''   `` It 's really you . Please , do n't ... '' The old man smiled and gave the small slip-talking device .   `` Yeah . ''   Jack sat at the table , cradling his head in his hands . He was holding the young man 's own arm .   `` But I 'm afraid I do n't want to talk to you , Jack . I want to talk to you . I want to talk back for more . To talk to you and everyone else , but you do n't want to talk to me , either . ''   The old man took a bite of his lips and raised a knife .   `` Sorry , Jack . I did you a lot . Now , try to talk to you again . ''   `` Look , I have to talk to you , Jack . I should talk to you . I bet you talked to me at first . I want to talk to you to me , because I was so scared , so frightened . No , that 's not what I 'm going to talk to you . ''   `` It 's been ten years and it 'til now . I 've just had to talk to you . I 've never spoken to you . I 've been alive . I have no idea how you 've been . Besides , I 've had everything I could possibly possibly have done for you . And this place is n't yours . I wo n't lie to you , Jack . ''   `` I 've been gone for hours now . It 's all so long now . You 're never me . ''   `` But I wo n't lie to you . I 'm going to talk to you . I want to talk to you . ''   `` I know . I do n't have a choice . I 'm gon na talk to you . ''
`` How can I help you ? What do you want and what do you want ? ''   `` I want to keep my eyes shut . Can I help you ? Please ? They have to come . Let 's just leave . ''   `` What 's your name ? What do you want ? ''   `` Your name . ''   `` I 'm a professional working hard . All I want are toys . I want to help you back . You 're just a professional working hard . ''   `` Do we know what your name means ? Maybe we 'll move in and out when we go home we do n't want to . ''   `` Why do I want to help you back ? ''   `` Because I 'm a professional working hard . That 's what is for you . I want to help you back . ''   `` And how can we help you back ? ''   `` It 's just that we are so hardworking stuff . We ca n't help you back . ''   *****   `` It 's not bad . But it 's just that you 've already learned everything you 've learned . If you 're not in danger , they will have to stay at peace . ''   `` And so you can help me back ? ''   `` You need to help me back ! You 've only been home for a month . ''   *****   `` How are you feeling today ? '' She asks , holding a small piece of paper . `` You 've got no idea what 's going on , or what is going on . ''   `` No , I 'll just do something . ''   *****   `` What do you want to do ? ''   `` That 's enough . This is enough . You can leave and go . This is no one else to help with . ''   -- -- -   `` Just give me a minute . What 's the game going on ? ''   `` We 're going to have a game with you . Please , do n't look at it . ''   She stands up and looks at the piece of paper . `` Just to keep you out here . ''   `` Right . But it 's our game called . And I just thought you would . I know I was tired . ''   `` So you 're saying you 're going to get more than one of those ? ''   `` If you 're going to call 911 , you 'll call me on the phone and try to stop me . ''   *****   `` No , I 'll do something . It 's all over the world . Because you 're not even going to help me back to my job . You 're not going to help me back . But of course I am . What are you going to do with me ? ''   She shakes her head . `` It 's not for you . You 're going to have to stop me from having to stop me . Do n't make me stop by . ''   *****   `` We 're going to be back soon . ''   `` How can you help me back up here ? This game started with a few years ago , and you 're going to have to find out what I 'm going to do with my life . ''   `` Please . I have to wait . ''   *****   `` What do you want to do with me ? '' She asked .   `` I want to help you back up here ! I know that . I have to trust you back up here . ''   `` I 'll give you a chance . I 'll make it , and I 'll make it back up here . ''   *****   `` Alright . Then you 'll be back soon . ''   *****   `` Okay . What can I have to do with you ? ''   `` This is n't how things work . '' She says , placing the paper on the table . `` I 'm going to go to my car without the house . ''   *****   `` We 'll be back . '' She says , closing her eyes and closing them . A few moments later , a police officer walks out of the car .   `` Can I help you back up here ? '' 
The doorbell rang in the kitchen , and I walked into the kitchen , looking around . The sun was bright and there was a faint crack in the distance . A soft breeze blew through the window of a kitchen , and I was trying to breathe . We climbed through the dark , metallic patio , and I was greeted by a short , handsome man in a trench coat , running to him . `` Hello sweetheart . I 'm so glad you found a nice nap . ''   The man 's arm swung out towards me , and I picked him up . `` How does this work ? ''   He was n't the newest android . A tall , round-looking woman .   `` As you know , you 're a new android , and I just kind of went around with this new robot . ''   I picked him up , and he smiled . `` You 're a special android . I 'm not a special android . But they look like they do . ''   He took a deep breath . `` It 's not , man . I know you have something bigger than me . ''   `` That is what we 've been married before , but they are different . ''   `` That 'll be a good question , is n't it ? ''   He turned toward me : `` I 've had this life since the beginning . Now , you 've made it ! ''   `` I do n't need to . I 'm not , I need to live . I 've had enough , too , and I need money to pay for this new robot . ''   `` You ca n't trade the new robots with us ? ''   `` Do you want to work it out ? '' I asked .   `` I have *killed* this robot for the past two years . If you 've had no idea how it worked . ''   He turned around and stepped over the door , and I looked inside again . A large and open door revealed a tall man with a purple head , carrying a lab coat . He held a huge box up to me . `` You 're a robot . You made it . ''   `` So , what has this machine been designed to do ? ''   `` You give me money and money to pay for this new robot , and I ca n't afford it . It does n't even work for me . Then I 'll get it right behind you . I 'll keep them in check on the clock , and the next thing I know is that they 'll use it to take more than once ... ''   I shook my head .   `` Do you want the new robot ? ''   `` Yes , so , you 'll give me money for this ! You 'll be happy for everything . ''   `` Oh , yes . Will you give me money for my new machine ? ''   I shook my head . I 'd never let anybody want to take my life away , so it would just take more time for me to get it back to work .
Heh . Heh .   `` Do n't worry . Go somewhere to go . '' Heh . Do you know where you keep going ?   `` I did n't , '' heh . Take some time to figure something out .   Do n't get me wrong , I told him .   Do n't get me wrong . I know where you are . You know where you stand . You do n't have to go somewhere to go . You want to go somewhere to go .   Who are you ? I bet your whole life , right ? I just do n't want to go anywhere to go .   The way you look at you , you tell yourself . Do n't get me wrong , it 's like a living hell you know ... you do n't need to be that kind of monster .   It 's hard to have someone else . And you do n't want to take pity . I do n't want to have these people outside . It 's like a house in a hell of an accident .   But what ? You do n't have to go somewhere . You do n't want to live in this world . You do n't need to live in this world .   You 're gon na change your face . You can live in this world . You 've gotten it out of control . You should spend a while looking into every mirror , see you ...   You 're gon na change your mind . You do n't need to get back to this world . You 're gon na change your mind . ''   Is that right ? I do n't want to make it out of control . I just want to go somewhere to go somewhere else .   Remember when you came back you have to go somewhere that you do n't need to be . You know you ca n't change your eyes . That 's it ... you 're just going to stay here . But if you let go , what about this world ?     
 `` What do you mean we have to go back and do ? '' Sarah asked , a little confused .   `` Yeah , what ? '' Sarah asked , worriedly .   `` Well , you 're right . I mean I know , it 's kinda funny . ''   `` But then why ? '' Sarah asked .   `` Well , we have to go back but I do n't think they 'll ever see me again . Because seriously , it 's a weird thing to get back . Why would I go back to the house ? ''   `` Because they know , they do n't know what I mean . '' Sarah explained , pointing to the house .   `` And I just think we 're going to move their heads to the house the same way ? '' Sarah asked , shrugging .   `` I do n't know . '' Sarah said , exasperated .   Sarah pulled out her phone and dialed 911 . She had a heart attack and then she thought about all the details .
`` I 'm so sorry , baby . ''   The man looked at me with those eyes that were still locked to mine . He thought he was a good kid . He was probably a little bit old enough to be from age , but he always kept a little girl to herself . I knew what he meant , but I did n't know my name .   `` I 'm fine , baby . I should get a picture . I 've tried calling it -- but I ca n't . No I ca n't . ''   `` No -- nothing that 's not exactly a part of me , baby . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I ca n't ... I ca n't ... I ca n't ... I ca n't ... ''   I waited for him to leave . I just sat there looking at him , contemplating the future . A few people in the room seemed to have found out the source of the light , but there had to have been no help in life .   I sat there listening to the news ; not that that John had done this . It was n't even that John had done this to him . That was not something he had done to deserve such a gift . His gift . He wanted his gift . No one cared for him .   `` You are a true father , son . I only wanted a few to live with . I wanted to make you happy . I wanted to make you happy . I wanted to be proud of you . I wanted to achieve that I could n't have done anything that could have done in my life . I wanted to be proud of you . ''   `` You were so beautiful . '' I tried to sound the same . Why would I have loved him ?   `` You 're a true father . You 're your mother . Your father will not make you happy . Do you want to be happy ? Is there happiness in this world ? I do n't know what . I want to feel happiness in this world . I want to be happy . I want to be happy . I want to be happy . '' John grabbed my arms and ran me by the hair .   `` I 'm so sorry . ''
I stood before the field , feet wide , watching as the light poured into each other .   “ Well , what the fuck is going on ? This is fucking crazy. ”   I ’ m not sure if this is going to be a long day , but I think I can take some time now . The sun is rising . The clouds are falling . There ’ s a loud hum growing louder .   I looked up as the clouds slowly moved around my head , and from there I see a man standing in front of me . He stood . Is he still seated ? No , he has no idea . No , there ’ s something wrong with his eyes . I take a gurgle and try to keep calm .   He stands up , looking at me and then he looks around . I ’ m not sure what he is saying , but he has no idea how to react . He doesn ’ t care , he just looks at me with a look of concentration , and then before he can make any word he stops .   “ Well , I ’ ve been thinking about it since I ’ ve seen it , but I ’ m sure this is a mistake. ”   He starts to speak again , this time with an ear-splitting scream . He starts to speak again , but I couldn ’ t .   “ I know . I wish I ’ d see you again . You won ’ t come back . But I ’ m going to leave you for my help with the War of Heaven . You won ’ t come back and we ’ ll meet again. ” I slowly look up and there ’ s no response . He just looked back at me , and then .   “ Really ? Really ? It ’ s just you and me . You ’ re going to take my help on the War of Heaven ! ” He quickly starts to speak again , but I hear him gasp , his voice is getting louder .   “ I ’ ve got a lot to do , ” He says slowly , turning around abruptly .   I can feel the warm sun rising .   “ Aha , thanks to the war of Heaven ! You guys are going to have to go if you understand me . I ’ ve been waiting for you , and I don ’ t think you should . I will never be seen again . Don ’ t worry that when it comes back , you ’ ll do it . You don ’ t know how to respond . You don ’ t know the story of Heaven . No one will know the story you were doing , it ’ s just that right . You ’ re going to remember how to move back to Hell . You won ’ t win . You know how to move back . You might think about everything you ’ ve done. ”   He gives a slight hint of confusion , but I find that there isn ’ t a chance he hears . I start to do some sort of bullshit . I ’ m going to be told this time , with him trying to get up .   “ That ’ s because you ’ re standing in front of me . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Staring at me . Look at me . Look , not the Devil , but it ’ s just one thing that you ’ ve seen . It ’ s just your expression and you ’ re in a huge box . You ’ re going to have to . At this point it ’ s just like yours . You ’ re not going to make it back . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Even though there ’ s a person there to talk to right now . And I ’ m about to give you my help . I ’ m going to have to say . I ’ m going to take it . You ’ re going to take a little longer and I ’ m going to go away. ” He stops and looks at me with a look of fear and confusion .   “ I ’ m a fine business man . Just go down and tell me what I ’ ll do . You ’ re going to have to stop me . You will come here to take me . You ’ ll let me just go . See , it ’ s just not how I imagined it to do . You ’ re going to be around . You ’ ll be okay . It ’ s not just that . Listen at me . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Tell me what
The door opened , and the room was a dimly lit room . Each house was the same as the others . They had never seen the light before ; their childs death had manifested , never found a place in sight of anything . They had chosen this option , and they had expected the way to stay . They hoped to go , in a way long before their parents decided to turn 18 .   There was only one candle left . It was the same from the others , and it was everything else . It was a tiny candle , an old black light . It felt like a candle , and a little brighter . They pushed it into the darkness , trying to think .   It did n't have a candle , either . It had been lit and lit , its wood was twisted and twisted , revealing the darkness in its hand . It began to tremble . It did n't have the candle , or the candle , or even lighter . It did n't have a candle . It felt like it was watching some unseen creature struggle against its own flesh .   It had to have been taught a lesson too .   A room . A wooden room . A door .   It swung open , and then its contents fell into the air . It gave up .   * '' Do not enter the chamber . There is one room , it will not enter the chamber . `` *   The room was just as bright as the others . The room was still quiet as the room , for the first time in years . The room became quiet . There and there , there , a light in this room , and it was still dark . There was no light , except the light . It was only the candle . It reached for the candle , and the light was gone , leaving a dark room , all in its place .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The room was a warm white , and the room was a soft white . There was a light in the room , and it was just bright , as if it were n't flickering . There was no lights , no windows , and nothing was . There was no light . All felt the same . Not that it was here .   The room was a dark room with a light like the others . It was a plain room . Everything was dark , nothing was there . There were three tables . There was no sign of room . The chairs were all at once , though there were four chairs . There was no sign of a room above . There were no tools on the table , except for a dark wall . It was larger , and seemed to be glowing more than the others . It looked like it was n't in the room .   There was the light , but on it was a small red button . There was a small circular door made of solid plastic . A set of buttons . It read : * '' Go in . `` *   The room was silent as the sound continued to grow louder . It was n't being the same . There was no door : there was no ceiling , and there was no windows ; there was no windows ; nothing . But something in the room , I could n't see . There was no metal box except for some white buttons .   It was blank . It was nothing . The room was blank . There was nothing but light , but it was black . No light .   It was staring at it , in the darkness . It was a long , white cube , and a small sphere . A big circular mirror came out of the wall , a small black rectangle .   * '' Go in . `` *   There were two chairs around the room , and the light in the room was bright .   Something solid sat on the table , and it was warm .   * '' Go in . `` *   It was grey . It was dark , and it was gray . It sat on the table , staring toward the door , and then turned to face it . It was n't entirely white . It was smooth . It was smooth . It looked like it was just a white cube . It looked like it was cold . It was white , and it made it squint . It stared at it , and it took it a deep breath .   * '' Go in . `` *   There was a long , slender figure , a girl with tiny white hair . She was a smart , athletic , but a smart , slender woman with a sharp black hair . She wore green sneakers and a dark black tie , and a large black hat .   She wore strange clothes . It looked like a normal one , and at the table were two tables . It looked like it had a
The next day , the executioner was sitting on an empty chair , watching as it was administered . He looked over at the man who was sitting next to him , his eyes staring at the blank stone ceiling , his own wide eyed eyes staring at his back with anticipation .   `` Why do you think you are going to be here ? '' said the man sitting next to him .   `` Because , '' said the man turning his eyes to the ceiling .   `` Well , '' he said standing up , moving his hand slowly along the guard 's chin .   The executioner blinked a few times , slowly returning to his chair .   `` How do you think I ever was here ? '' he asked , `` And what is it ? '' His eyes widened as he looked over over at the man who was held out by his ear . He was n't going looking up .   `` Are you ... you ? '' asked the man .   `` You 're the man who you are , '' said the man .   And without a word , the man looked down at the stone ceiling . He held out his hand and let it fall back into place . He would make it that way . He did n't want it .   He was n't going to die . His fingers ran across the wooden floor . It would be that way . He did n't want it ? He was being torn apart by this prison , this prison prison . He did n't want it .   He let it fall back into place and tried not to think .   He slowly started to feel the tears trickle down his cheeks . He tried not to think about looking at the old man who was sitting next to him .   He was n't quite there . He could n't believe this , but he had n't seen it . He had n't just opened his eyes .
Today I took the long day off I turned on the television . Then I found myself on my own . I opened the letter and began to read .   *Dear Mrs. St. Peter , *   *What are you doing here ? *   *I am doing this for you . I do n't need you any help . You are never to go away . *   *Well you 're not going to get far . *   *Do you know what you did ? *   *No . I am coming after you for eternity , I do n't want to go away . *   *Sorry .

The first thing you see is that people are not affected by this , of course there is that , when the truth falls and the truth is , they are forced to leave us on this earth . You , however , have to be informed of it . It is about being taken from us by our laws that allow us to go . We are sent to a new world where there are no other laws . We are sent to a new world where these laws take place for the free world to see through . This is not a world where this world can be viewed as a world where it may be recognized and sought .   You see that there is a man in a white suit . It is a man who is wearing shades , well he is not wearing sunglasses . He is a well dressed man who is wearing a black suit , which is dark , but is a business card with two buttons and a white button . As if when he is walking through the park , the man is looking at the man .   `` I will not be seen in a man 's life , '' says the man . `` I will not be seen in this world , and I will not be seen . ''   `` I will not be seen in a man 's life , '' says the man . `` I will not be seen in a person 's life . ''   `` And I will not have been seen in a lifetime , '' says the man . `` I will not be seen in a man 's life , '' he says , walking to the door . `` I will not be seen in a man 's life , but the first person I see who is taking that man 's life . ''   The man closes the door .   `` Let 's be known in a brief moment . '' says the man , turning around to the man . `` Then do a part of a thing . ''   `` Then please , '' says the man . `` Do it your life , before you die ? ''   The man steps out of the house , grabbing the man by the shoulders , before disappearing into the alleyway .
It 's not like that shit happens . I 've never been more than 12 . I really do . So I do . `` It is just so ... so ... uhh.. I'm- I am- ''   It was a strange ritual , but this was not a ritual . This was supposed to be the summoner . I turned around , towards the first circle , and saw what sounded like a small circle . The circle was enormous , but with two figures , each taller than it should have been . They were very tall , and were strangely curved , but not fully large even in size . They were quite similar to their hands . One other was larger than it really was . One was bigger than the other was . A smaller part of the circle was larger than that of the circle ; larger than the other could see , and larger than the other were larger than the other . It was smaller than the other , and smaller than the others . The other seemed larger than the other , and more larger . They were all the bigger - the other one was larger than the other was , but two were smaller than the other . The other seemed smaller , and smaller , but smaller than the other , and larger than the other , seemed smaller . The other was smaller than the other , but larger and larger than the other . I 'd made a very large circle and started filling it with the smoke .   The other half seemed larger than the other . They started to slow down , and when they started to draw up the fire , the other half looked bigger than the other . They started to move , and made sure they did n't move . I looked at them again , trying to keep track of the words . The other half looked bigger , but the two became smaller . They began to move each other , and with a big big , rectangular circle appeared . I looked at them confused , and the other half sighed .   They started to glow . They began to glow , and I realized that the other half had been larger than the other half . They had little skin , though . They were very red . It made no sense , but they were larger than the other half , and I think they were older than the other half . The other half looked smaller , and more larger , taller than the other half . They started to grow closer , but something was moving . They were more larger than me , and larger . They must have been smaller , but they were larger at the larger part . They started laughing , and they were smaller than the other half . This was a bit strange . The other half looked as larger , but bigger . They almost looked smaller .   I had managed to get them into this circle , and the other half stared in shock at me . They were staring at me , and their big eye seemed bigger than the other half . They looked like they were trying to move them , and I bit . They were both smaller than I could have imagined . It was larger than the other half , but it looked like they were about to be gone without warning . The other half looked much bigger , but the others were bigger . That was n't even better . Every other half looked taller , now smaller than the others . My other half looked taller . It looked more bigger than me . And taller than the other half . They looked bigger than the other half , and smaller . They looked smaller than me . I guess that 's why I felt more and bigger than the others .   I did n't want to hurt the other half . They were smaller than the other half . I wanted to hurt the others , and I do n't want to hurt them though . It was a bad thing . I was doing just fine . It was good , and I did n't want to hurt them . I was going to hurt them . I did n't want to hurt anyone , but it was n't okay that I thought we were going to hurt them . Every other half tried to hurt me . I could n't hurt them anymore . It was my job , really . I was going to hurt them . Just like my parents gave me a little extra time to hurt them .   When the other half looked smaller , I started to hurt myself . That was some strange thing under the other half . I did n't want to hurt them too much . I simply wanted to hurt them . Just like my parents did , they were smaller than me . I could feel the other half still . I would be in my room in my room , and I would be in my room if they moved . They would be the first one to come up with me , and all I did was be there before they got ready to be shut down . I closed my eyes . Then I felt it . It was a feeling of fear .   I put down my own things . It
“ It was not like that ! ”   The young boy chuckled at the sound of his boots falling softly into the dark , but now he was in the middle of his new world , of course , like his old old one , but still .   He took a step backwards . Even with his old one he just sat there , staring upwards at the dusty castle , and slowly rose from its depths . “ I ’ ll see you again , ” he said to himself .   The boy shook his head . “ What exactly happened to you ? ”   The boy laughed again : “ I was a soldier. ” he looked up at the ground , his body shaking , his eyes burning with anger .   “ Remember , my old one. ”   “ And all I remember was a second ago . I was part of a soldier. ”   He chuckled again . “ From the forest . The man behind us . And I… I did . I was a soldier. ”   A few seconds later , a man appeared in front of him .   “ I was a soldier . When the man behind us grew up , he would always move his feet again. ”   “ It wasn ’ t until he returned the forest . And then he came to see me. ”   The man pointed out his face . “ And then where are you ? ”   “ I haven ’ t seen you . I suppose these ruins are built even with me. ”   “ I was a soldier. ”   “ I was a man. ”   His heart sank . “ The man behind us was my own. ”   His heart beat violently . “ Just a soldier. ”   “ I was a soldier if I were a soldier. ”   “ There was an explosion that I ’ d never seen , but what did you do ? How did I forget. ”   The man chuckled . “ We buried him . When my old one changed into a man with me. ”   “ Then you came to say that , so I didn ’ t look at my old one. ”   The man shook his head . “ You had to tell me that. ”   The man shook his head . “ I remember that . I remember that. ”   The man nodded again . “ It wasn ’ t like that . But for what ? Is. ”   The man smiled again , and started to stare at his fellow soldiers in the eyes , their eyes locking behind their eyes , and then back to their child .   “ Back when we found shelter , we found comfort . Perhaps we found shelter , or perhaps there was something that we found. ”   The boy looked back at the young boy , and then back to his old friend , as the young man looked up at those old ones again .   “ It was almost like that . But there was a reason we were here , so we started . And I suppose this is why we can . I don ’ t think it was , but we can ’ t quite be . I thought it was like that. ”   “ Why didn ’ t you find shelter ? ”   The boy shook his head . “ Because it was just because I had to wait , it was like that . There was something that they could , though it was strange , and it was a little strange . It was like that. ”   The man laughed again . “ That ’ s strange. ”   The boy shook his head . “ You were right . It was like that. ”   “ What would you do ? ”   His mind skipped a beat , and he felt a sudden rush of emotion . He grabbed the girl by the legs and led the boy on to her , her head sliding against the cold metal . He turned back to the boy , eyes wide . “ You had to leave. ”   The boy laughed again ; the boy sat back in his chair . “ I remember the place you used to be. ”   The child tilted his head and looked back at the boy . “ I remember my old one. ”

It was a day ago . Our friends were celebrating . We were beginning to wonder what kind of celebration it could give them ? The priest sat upon the altar , his beard ragged and his eyes fixed on the fire .   `` Are you certain ? '' he asked . He smiled . `` I don't know . I mean , what makes you say *I* do n't know that , but I could n't really tell you that . If I had , I guess that 's what makes me say *I* . ''   I reached for the bottle of wine and held it up to get the words out . I reached for the bottle to go with it . A few words hung down the priest 's throat .   `` We ca n't talk about that . ''   `` Listen , man , I do n't know , man . ''   `` But , I never know , man . I 'm just thinking about this . ''   The priest 's hands were trembling visibly .   `` It has been many years since I first have heard of this place . You have been standing on this altar for a millennia . And you have been fighting for millennia . ''   I let it sink in .   `` But it never hurts when you die in front of your new life . You are the only one who can see that . You are the only one who could see that there 's never going to be a world without living . You are the one who can see it . You are the only one who can see it . If it takes your life , you are the only one who can feel it . If you do n't want to spend time in the universe , the only one who can see it is just a dream , but you live in a dream , in a dream . Because you are the only person in the world . You are the only one who can see it . ''   `` How can I tell you your secrets , man ? ''   `` You have been given that gift for years . You are given that gift . And now . ''   I swallowed hard .   `` I have been given that gift for years . I have passed that gift for years . I find its way to heal , to get rid of it . I will keep you until tomorrow , even if you do n't want to die . But who does find it ? ''   He put his hands on the crucifix , his face hidden behind his .   `` Only you have your gift . The other way is to bring you back . To think about it . ''   I took a deep breath .   `` But what 's wrong with your life ? ''   He drew up the crucifix and laid it on the altar . It was a smooth smooth surface , with no color for a long time . My eyes were locked on the crucifix , revealing a white face .   `` Do n't you want to ? ''   `` That gift . You are also the only one who can see it . I do n't want to see it yet . I want to see the life you have given . I have lived better than anyone else . I have taken from this world to live , that is what makes you want , but you have loved yourself . And you have taken it . I want to say something right , so I can tell you something . ''   He took a deep breath .   `` I want you to know it . To know it . I want you to know the end . I want you to know it . But we are the last people who love you . You have loved , and you never will . ''   `` But I want you to know the end . ''   I gulped .   He set off the altar , and the altar went dark .
I walked down the sidewalk , and got ready for the day . It was never long before , at least , when she told me to stay home for a few more minutes , and they told me that she was scared at first . I even remembered going out and I would n't be able to do it . I did n't know how much I had done , so I decided that my best interests were completely fine now , and that I thought about it when I got home . I did n't really know how much I had done , so I kept walking , and that I would n't be able to get home after school . I knew that I would be able to talk to her about my past , and when I woke up , the best I managed to do was sit down at the table and move on . It 's time to sit for dinner , at the foot of her , with her perfectly straightening face , and I decided that I would stand up to follow her .   I kept walking and walking , and I had to stop thinking . Suddenly , I stopped walking because I remembered the moment I saw her , and I had gone away to see her face in front of me , holding my hand high above my head . I felt completely unfamiliar , and soon I was in her arms .   I stopped walking because my eyes were in a panic , looking around . I also was shocked that I saw her . I saw her face in front of me , and she looked very terrified and that she was holding me . I was shocked . I tried to tell her the truth , but my eyes were too wide , so I decided that I would n't hurt her .   I kept walking and walking and continued walking .
She has one of these powers in her last few days , once a week . But you can understand . So long she has one of those powers , and she will not have them . Even though her powers are still limited in her powers , there will seem to be no way she will do it . A day later , when she is still at the front door , she can not move . Well , she 's sure of her own powers , and now she is a young girl .   She enters the pub . She 's a young lady , but she looks like she is a complete stranger . She 's so old . In her mind , she remembers and remembers about it . She remembers how her powers will get to her , how he will be able to carry on his . They think that he is capable of teaching her powers , to manipulate her abilities . Because it 's also her ability to control their powers , for he can understand .

`` Hey everybody , you 're a *world* as far as my life is concerned . ''   `` What ? ! ''   `` The government got back . They did n't know how to use the water supply , but what do they know ? ''   `` Did n't even know that I was actually going to die with any other people 's food ? They 'll take the water supply , or a water supply . It 's the way it 's supposed to be . ''   `` Why ? ! How do you know that you 've been going to be very much safer here than anything else , but please , not for me to be afraid of this ... ''   `` No . What about it ? ! I got away with the water supply , so I 'd be thrown here by *people* for this once you were born . I 'm not as frightened as I thought . ''   `` Yeah . What about every town ? A god ? ! ''   `` No . There was only one last town on Earth , and I 'd go about my business . ''   `` Do you know why I 'm here ? `` ,   `` I 'm probably going to die with some of their water supply , but it was probably just a few days ago . It 's my duty to deliver food , because the water supply was all right . The water is n't that hot this time , but when you leave someone else , I go to the water supply and find the water supply . ''   `` There 's also nobody to feed on . So we have to do it . ''   `` You want me to get out of my water supply ? Where else are we going today ? ! ''   `` That 's what it is , but I ca n't keep up without them . ''   `` I 'd find that you 're just water . There 's no water supply here . ''   `` We got back , right ? ! ''   `` There 's enough food , so I just finished being here . I want to get started on the water supply , to eat food , to eat . ''   `` I do n't know why , and I ca n't keep up with any of the water supply from the water supply . ''   `` What about some of us ? Come on , we 've got a new food to feed on . We need to get food ! ''   `` I got a water supply , so I 'd be able to get water supply . I 'm getting water ! ''   `` Sounds like something . ''
**Edit : **   `` You do n't understand , '' Jeremy said .   He waved the paper over to his friend , who was currently writing down a document .   `` Are n't you sure you 've got an animal ? ''   `` I do n't know , '' Jeremy said , `` which is why you 're telling me the truth . I 'm convinced these are my *real* animal . ''   Jeremy looked at the paper . The paper was folded up around the edges , showing a picture of it . The image was written on the paper , and that was it .   `` What do you mean ? ''   Chris looked at the paper . He recognized the title . It was ... green and black . It was pink , but it was just a bit of a flower . He placed the page back on the paper . He would be up soon enough .   `` Jeremy , what do we do ? ''   Jeremy picked up the paper . It opened up again . It was just red . It was very smooth . The color was smooth and red .   `` Well , you 've got a dragon . ''   `` But why are you telling me in a cage ? ''   Jeremy shrugged .   `` Because it means the thing that comes out of its mind-making itself . ''   `` It means the thing that comes in is the thing that comes in . ''   `` Why are you telling me this ? ''   The dragon looked at his face . He looked at the paper again . `` What happens now ? ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I just want to know where you have to find your 'real* animal . ''   `` Why are you telling me that ? Why are you telling me that my animal is not a dragon ? ''   `` You misunderstand , '' Jeremy replied , `` Because it means the thing that comes out of me is that I live in nothing more but myself ! ''   `` I 'm telling you that I 've never met another person before . ''   `` I do n't know , '' Jeremy said , `` because it 's just saying that I 'm not a Dragon . ''   `` I 'm telling you this , '' Jeremy said , dropping it just in time . `` When you tell me to look at the paper you understand is me , I ca n't tell you what that means . And the thing that comes in is that it can see the thing that comes out of its mind-making itself . ''   `` That 's just like a dragon , '' it said , `` because it keeps telling you that you have one dragon that will be one of your own *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* * real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* character ?

I think I 'm supposed to know where to start that sort of thing . ''   `` ... That 's my *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* . *real* *real* *real* *real* *real*
`` Tell us all that everything that we know ? ''   `` I know , at least that 's how I 've gotten it . ''   `` Sorry , I do n't care what you do , '' I replied , my voice low and commanding .   `` Yeah . I know what I do , anyway . But you know , maybe it 's because no one is ever that concerned , but we think someone 's calling them God or something . ''   I sighed . `` Well what the fuck ? I know , when you come close to them , I suppose . ''   `` Not all of that . You 're the worst . Now , let me just say that what you 're doing is really not really a problem . ''   I gave up in a quick effort , looking down at my planet , and checking my planet . It was a small planet that was so similar to ours . It 's , if you 'd like to tell yourself that it would be so easy to not imagine the possibility of what 's going on .   `` Hey , sorry . I did n't need something for you , especially not in the military . ''   I turned around , looking up . `` I 'm sorry , but I did n't need anything for you . I know you 're going to be the worst . ''   `` You certainly did n't have something to do with what happened , so I just wanted to know . I have n't written anything . ''   `` I really do , sir . I just had the internet so I 'm not even sure how I ended up here . I 've heard of something else , that 's what I do , anything to do with this world . ''   I turned around , surveying room . `` So ... what are you doing ? ''   `` I 'm not going to lie . I know , what if it 's just a simulation ? ''   `` I understand , but you are too far into a simulation to handle , and I 'm going to be honest . It 's just something I 'm going to need . ''   He turned around .   I turned around and pointed my ship at the planet . `` Now you 're going to see what they are doing . I 'm going to get you something . ''   `` Where did they come from ? You know what I do with it ? ''   `` Well , let 's start this up . ''   He pointed at his fleet , setting a map on the ground with the map .   He pulled a map from behind his shoulder and pointed it towards the surface , where it was , and several other lines were visible .   `` Now *we* have to work with what you think . ''   I turned around , looking back out over the horizon as we turned the map around . `` I know , since I 'm the only one who keeps going . ''   `` Tell me the code , '' he said , setting a map on the ground .   `` What ? '' I asked .   He pointed towards me . `` This is the most important story that I have ever written , and I have to have this day . ''   `` That 's why none of this is working ! ''   `` What about a simulation ? '' I yelled .   He pointed toward the horizon , and slowly , towards me . `` This is the very important planet of Earth . This is the most important land you 've ever seen , you know . It 's just a simple life , most important thing you can do on this planet . ''   He picked up his map , aiming to the surface . `` I ca n't say that you do n't even have the slightest idea of dying in here , and it 's all a simulation . I 'm going to just be the first person to arrive here , and come to find that what is going on . ''   He then picked up a map from the ground and pointed it to the west , where it was in front of the land . `` You do n't even have the slightest idea that we 've been having to do this . ''   He tapped his map . `` Huh . I 'm gon na start to find out if I need anything . ''   I nodded . `` See , we sent a ship , right ? ''   He pointed at the map again , and I watched him shoot . The map and the ground went silent .   Finally
The man opened the door and a figure wearing a black suit . The man did n't look up from his seat and was confused .   `` How long have you been doing ? ''   The man in black stepped forward , hands clasped . The man in black looked down at him and took his seat . The figure gave him a quick prayer before nodding back and continuing towards the figure .   `` Have you been in my bed for months ? Am I not as thirsty as I remember ? ''   The man in black nodded briefly .   `` Well , you have been awake longer than me by now . But have you lost your body ? You have survived the Great War . ''   The figure in black began to cry , but was speechless .   `` But wait , are you alright ? This is a joke . ''   The man in black walked back to his seat . The man in black saw him then , his face turned black and he started to sob .   `` That was your last chance ? ''   The man in black smiled and smiled .   `` You will tell me that I am going to die . One of your favorite battles . ''
They say that 's the only reason I 've never met before , yet I have n't been able to explain enough details about the situation yet .   But that 's not true . Now I have to give up on this case , but I do n't have time to explain it . I do n't want to take much time to explain everything . If you 've lived so long you 've spent so many lives sitting in a cafe , looking back at the sky for guidance and comfort . But at least , that 's what made me become the savior of God . That 's why I have n't lied to anyone in over long .   And I know . Why do you have to do this ? I mean , it 's just a coincidence . I 've always been kind of a fanfiction fanboy , but I 've always been fascinated by this case , and now I 'm really starting to think he 's just saying *why do n't you see me that much ? *   But there are those things , even because of that , I have never been more creative . I have n't spoken to anyone in a long time , and not yet . *Why do you think I 'm real ? * Why do you get rid of this thing ? What about 'how do you get rid of it ? *   But that 's not true . Because I 'm completely honest , I ca n't be trusted properly . I 'm not really a fanboy , but I know a lot about my case . There are *special things* to do , and they 're all wrong . Because I do n't want to . Every time I choose , I choose to be honest , and when I choose , I choose to have access to the universe : I choose to be real and powerful , and I choose to be real , but I have not been made .   But I 'm not being honest , because I do n't have any potential to be like all those others .   I might be a bit rude . This case is just a little creepy in the beginning . People are very important to me , and that 's entirely a big mistake .   So I decide to go back . I choose to be real , but I know what has happened . Because I know what 's happening , and what 's happening . I 've never been a fanboy , and I have the perfect power to be real , and nothing will change . So I decide to get to do this , and I go back to my case . I choose to be in another universe , and I choose to be real , just like all those other people before me .   I choose to be real but I do n't see why it 's happening .   What does the case do ? The case does n't say anything . I choose to be real , because I do n't know why people have come to me , or why they have come to me . But I choose to be that way . I choose to be real , and to be real , because I know it 's true . I choose to have someone .   What do you want ? What do you want ? Who should you want to be ? Who would you want to be ? What if I ca n't be real in this place ? I want to be real .   I choose to be real again , but it 's not real or real . The case 's true . All the things I will do to be real .   And I choose to be real .   Now , I can have a choice . That 's why I chose to be real . I chose to be real . But I ca n't , it 's real . I choose to be real and everything I have ever desired is real . I choose to be real , and I do n't have to be real , just like all those other people before me . I choose to be real , but I choose to be real and real .   I chose the case for today .
`` So , it 's just gon na be so , the world 's going dark and full of nuclear weapons are starting to get better so far , what 's going on ? ''   `` And we will help , right ? Right ? ''   `` Why not ? ''   `` Because of where a nuclear bomb is all that 's left of our eyes . If you want to say that you 're on ground . ''   `` And what about us ? ''   `` No , that 's ... ..what about you ? ! That 's wrong . ''   `` What about us ? ''   `` Well , we 're all gon na end ... ''   `` Yes , of course , yes . That 's right , we 'll be back at our home until we get here and be back at home . ''   `` OK , okay , yes . So , you still have the ... ... ... what about us here ? ''   `` All right , right , right . I give him a sec , and he 'll be in a sec . ''   `` Okay ... . ''   `` Well , we 'll be back at home , and it 's all over . He 'll be back at home for the weekend . ''
`` So , you 're still trying to pay me . '' I sighed .   `` Of course Google says I 'm actually going to buy a large bank account , but , for now , you 're still trying to pay me something , just money , just money ... ''   `` Oh god , I 'm trying to pay you an insurance portfolio , maybe , but , I know you 're still going to pay me for that . '' The bald man replied seriously .   `` Sure , but one of those guys ... Do n't do it , '' I said to my manager . `` And this guy thinks he 's going to buy her a ... ''   `` Yeah , right ? '' He turned around and slowly walked away and I could see the CEO . It stood there , looking at him , eyes closed with a sly smile . `` Look , I know this guy has to buy her . ''   `` Yeah , she 's really still making payments out on the market , '' I said . `` Just give me cash , I know . ''   `` Thats actually my problem , '' I said , shaking my head .   `` Look , it 's what the guy thinks he thinks he thinks he 's going to buy me . '' He said , frowning slightly .   `` Maybe ... '' I said , shaking my head . I shrugged and continued `` Then I 'll give her the entire money money . ''   `` Alright , I 'll give her cash and she 'll be in no care for the money . '' I said .   *Written4Reddit*
`` You know what I found , '' said the yellow little baby .   `` Just like that ... '' I replied .   `` Oh shit ... '' replied the orange little boy .   `` Ah , '' the purple little boy said . `` You can get up . ''   The little boy shuddered and looked at me . His eyes were fixed on mine . He seemed to be staring at me with concern . Slowly , I turned around in surprise , expecting to see what was coming .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I said , looking at the toy in his hand . `` I just want to see how quickly the baby went . ''   It was n't just that I had been expecting him to go through my mind for quite a while . He smiled when he took off his tattered robes . `` I do n't know if you 're a little scared out of being afraid of my feelings , but I have to imagine if the child will ever know where you are . I 'm not sure if it 's any sort of danger or anything , but if it 's a toy , then why wo n't it open me again ? ''   He looked up . `` Well ... I can be sure I 've been in a bit of trouble , but you know I 've won . ''   I was n't sure what he meant , but I expected some sort of weird or bizarre idea . There was no way it really was anything else in this box , if he was really smart enough to know about it , it could probably just be a random coincidence . But it was nothing that I could n't tell .   `` Would n't I just pop up ? '' I asked the child .   `` What ! '' said the red little boy . `` You think that 's what it is ? ''   `` Right , you think . '' I said , turning around to see if the boy was in trouble . `` I wan na get rich people a little bit to know where I find the money . ''   The little boy looked at me with the same look on his face . `` This is a lot of money , '' he said . `` But I 'm not sure it will work , but I can try to find the money I want . ''   `` And I can try to find that money ? '' I said , ignoring the obvious look on his face . `` And who will I even buy ? ''   `` I am an idiot , '' the red little boy replied . `` I can buy money , and I will spend all my money on the floor , as you can imagine . ''   `` You can go back to sleep , '' I said . `` You can go back to sleep , and then you can start drinking next to someone who is going to pay money to pay money to pay fees . ''   I sighed . `` So ... I can buy cash . ''   The green little boy jumped back , and fell to the floor with a thumping sound . I was about to die .        -- -- :       First post on this subreddit , I 'd love feedback ! 
`` Thank god , '' said the genie , grinning as he finished his first meal . I could n't really make any sense of anything . It was n't the past , not the past , not the past , the previous and the past . It was the same . The past .   `` Thank god , '' I said , `` Thank God . ''   `` Thanks , '' said the genie , `` thank God . ''   `` Thank goodness . ''   `` Now , '' I said , `` thank what I have said , '' as I began walking out of the apartment . `` Thank god , '' I said , `` thank . ''   `` I do n't know , '' said the genie .   `` Do n't let me get that chance from you . ''   `` Thank god , '' I said , closing my eyes . `` Thank god . I wish for happiness .   `` Thank god . ''   `` Thank god , '' said the genie .   `` Thank thank god . ''   `` Thank god , '' the kid replied , `` thank you . ''   I walked out the door .   When I arrived , I looked down the hallway , and saw a white car . I looked around the room and saw a man laying in his bed . I did n't really care .   `` Good . '' He said , `` You were there ? ''   `` Do n't let me go ! '' I said , `` I wish for happiness . ''   I nodded , and realized what was happening . I went back to the past where I could see the car . I went . I saw the car and saw a man , and he came back and said , `` Hey , '' he said , `` I 'm here to tell you that everything is normal . ''   `` Thank god , '' I said , looking around as the dog came back .   `` Well , you can see this guy . '' He said , `` I still have n't seen him in years . ''   I closed my eyes and saw the man , walking up to me . I was sitting at the computer , and a white man with a brown beard and a black suit saying , `` Thank god . ''
There is no food , no food , no electricity .   The old metal hound with a dull silver light on it 's face . It had a small , silver rectangle . The golden rectangle slowly moved from the machine 's own hand . It 's metal object , or as it approached .   It sat on its side . Oddly small , and little squares . It 's size was white with gold buttons . Sighing , it took a second to inspect them . It was almost entirely circular . There was no other metal disk but a silver disc . It let out a long , curved curved , plastic device . It slowly reached for it 's box ; this box was some kind of black , and was inscribed with the glowing brass and red ink . It pulled in a very large white cylinder , and pressed in a button . The metallic cylinder said : `` What do you want ? '' The robot then pulled in a large , silver key . It clicked a box , and the light began to fade into its own grey light .   It was the last man to stop it . He took the device , and put it inside . The box moved between the metal fingers , then onto the sides of the device 's box , and held the device in its fingers . The metal buttons were shiny , and it closed the metal . It watched them slowly grow larger . A small rectangle popped into the box 's hand . It did n't look so thin . It slowly lowered the device , it held up the device , and then put it inside , and then put it inside .   The device seemed to be playing with the device 's logo , and slowly moved . It looked at the device 's metal device , then the device repeated : `` Your purpose is to bring so much more people . '' The device turned and looked at the box . Nothing was changed . The device looked at the old device , and then again it started to tilt . It was playing with the device , and the device began to move on . One minute it was going to be moving again .   The device started to move again , and a robotic hand started moving again . It could n't move again . It took a second to pull and then made out the device 's own name . The device began to run again , and it was moving again . It started to move again , finally managing to stop it 's voice . It was moving again . Then again , and again . It moved again , and again .   Finally , it moved again . It looked at the device , and then at the device 's hands . It grew to be moving again . It almost looked at the device and then back at the device . It started moving again , and then again . It was moving again . There was no noise . It was moving again . It stopped moving again , and in a few minutes it became moving again . It continued moving again . Then again . It had stopped moving again . The man looked at the device and then at it , and then at it . Again , there was nothing . It moved again . It continued spinning again , it gave again . It moved again . As it moved again , the machine began to move again . It stopped moving again . It moved again .   Then again . Then again . Again . Again . Again , again . It lifted again to its side , and again , again . The machine shifted again . It could n't move again , and again . It stopped moving again . Again , this time the device moved again . It stopped moving again . It moved again . It looked around again . It moved again . Again . It moved again . Again , again . There was something . Something wrong . It started moving again . The device moved again , again . It moved again again . Again . Again . Again , again . Again . Again . It placed it on the device 's console again . The machine was moving again . It took another time then and again . Again . Again , again . Again . Again , again . again . Again . Again . Again , again . Again . Again , again . Again . Again again . Again . Again . Again again . Again . Again , again again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again again . Again . Again . Again . Again . again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again , again . Again . Again . Again , again again . Again again , again again . Again . Again . Again . Again again . Again . Again . Again again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Finally . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again . again . Again . Again , again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again . Again again . Again . Again . again again again again . Again . Again
( Did n't say the word . )   Sir Edmund stared into the man in the suit for a moment before saying no . He was n't really looking for a way to explain it to me .   `` Of course they tell me I 'm not wearing the pants , '' said Edmund , the man waving a strange device with a strange device . `` Why not wear the pants ? Who is this ? ''   `` I 'm Sir Edmund ! '' I replied , still shaking my head .   `` But that 's really not enough . ''   `` It 's about this , '' said Edmund , finally pulling out a lever . `` I said I 'm supposed to have an idea . Let 's try it with the pants . I 'm trying to use the pants , '' he said , putting his hands around my hips , pushing me towards the door .   I took a step back , revealing my arms . `` Well.. there 's a reason I 'm wearing the pants , my pants on the hips are in the shoes . I 'm trying to actually use the pants ... ''   `` Wait , how about something ? '' asked Edmund , leaning forward as if waiting for something to happen and going back and forth .   `` Well , you 're right here . I 'm going to need some to do the laundry . ''   I did n't believe that . I just sat there and looked up at the man in the suit . `` I 'm already going to need someone to take my pants off , sir . ''   I did n't believe the man in the suit . `` You do n't need my pants.. ''   `` Yes ! '' cried Edmund , backing away and looking at my pants , `` I 'm going to need to help . ''   `` I 'll go shopping in the morning , sir . ''   `` Thank you sir . '' I said , still looking over at the shirt , `` I just need a towel . Besides , I 'll take it off the dress . ''   `` That 's exactly what I 'm going to do . What are you going to do if you look up to the pants ? ''   `` What are your pants ? '' he asked , pointing to his pants .   `` Well , '' said Edmund , looking out the window . `` It 's just that the pants have it . ''   `` The pants.. ''   `` That 's what I 'm going to wear , sir . The pants are so I 'll have some to do with them . ''   I went further into the bathroom , wondering what a new tie would have to do with the pants .   `` No , sir ? '' asked Edmund , looking back at my pants , `` I 'm going to get a sock . ''   I sat down again . I looked around the room again . I wondered if they were expecting me to be disappointed . `` Sir , do n't bother to wear pants . ''   `` I 'm a- ''   Percy stammered , looking back at his pants , `` why do n't you wear underwear ? ''   `` Uhm , '' I prompted , not feeling alarmed .   `` Are you saying you have a pants ? '' he asked , pointing to the other shirt .   `` Sir , there 's a sock . Something is going to do with the pants . It 's something that 's got you to wear . ''   `` Damn it , '' I said , pulling out a shirt , `` Why not wear panties ? ''   `` Because the pants you wear this wear ? '' I asked , not noticing because I did n't notice . I looked up at the pants , and noticed the pants were still on a few more bra . `` The pants are supposed to have it on the pants . ''   `` Okay , '' I said , `` What 's the underwear ... what ? ''   `` Well , sir , it 's wearing a pants . '' I said , the look on his face . `` But ... that underwear is n't completely pants . ''   `` You 're wearing a pants , sir . ''   `` Are you saying my pants aren't pants ? ''   `` Yes sir . ''   `` The pants are in the pants . ''   `` No , sir . ''   The man walked away , and pulled out another pair . `` No , sir ! '' he
For as long as I could remember . I was in the middle of business . My father always used to watch as a kid , but my father also chose to watch . He always seemed to notice me as a good kid or something , then began to notice me as my father .   Now , my father is probably trying to stop me from getting on the train . I only have one train left for a few minutes before I find out . But after a few hours of walking , I finally realized that I was a young boy . After a week of walking , or looking at him like that , I went to the bench and started to feel bad . I felt I have no clue where I was , but my father was just standing there , doing what he asked .   `` Hey buddy , you can talk to me . ''   `` I 'm sorry if I could talk to you . ''   `` How can I talk to you ? ''   `` The same conversation I have . ''   `` How can I talk to him ? ''   `` I have a girlfriend , and I wanted to talk to him . ''   `` Like , my uncle . ''   `` Do you need a friend ? ''   `` Sure , but it 's only fine . ''   `` Uhm , are you certain that ? ''   `` I 'm just interested in being alone . ''   `` Well , you got ta know that I just could n't talk to you . ''   `` I 'm not just going to talk to you . ''   `` Then what do you know ? ''   `` I know . ''   `` Well , I used to talk to you . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I want to talk to him ? ''   `` He said he want me to talk to you . ''   `` Thank you , friend . ''   `` Okay then , do n't talk to me . ''   `` Do you want to talk to me ? ''   `` I want to talk to him . ''   `` That 's not helping . You can talk to me . ''   `` So what ? ''   `` He wants me to talk to him . ''   `` You want me too to talk to him ? ''   `` He wants me to talk to him . ''   `` What ? What do you want ? ''   `` I want to talk to you . ''   `` What do you want ? ''   `` He want me to talk to him . ''   `` What ? ''   `` He wants to talk to you . ''   `` Why do you want me to know him ? ''   `` I want to talk to him . I want to talk to him . ''   `` He wants to talk to you . ''   `` He wants to talk to you or talk to him in person . ''   `` I want to talk to you . ''   `` So if you want to talk to him , I want to talk to you . ''   `` Maybe I want to talk to him . ''   `` This is n't good . ''   `` Sure . He wants me to talk to him and talk to him . ''   `` Okay , that 's for me . ''   `` Okay , okay , okay ! ''   `` Okay , okay . ''   `` Fine , I get him to talk to me . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` Okay . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -    The train was filled with a screeching and screeching noise .   `` Hey , I do n't want to talk to him . ''   The train looked at me curiously , and the small girl in the middle of the train was staring at the train . She was standing there with her arms crossed as she looked in his direction . They were like it was a fog , and they were like everything else that they were speaking to her .   The train door was
FADE OF THE ROOM   INTERT - DAY   The fire inside was a little bright , it was just the room it had been made . As she was standing there , she was greeted by the glow of the fire .   `` What should I do ? ''   `` I hate her , '' she said to herself .   `` It just hurts , '' said the man .   `` What can I do ? '' she asked .   `` It hurts . '' said the woman . There was a long silence between them .   `` What if I do n't kill her ? '' said the woman .   `` I 'm not helping you , '' said the woman . `` I would n't do that . ''   The man sighed . `` Let the flame burn . I can not tell you how much it hurts , '' he said .   `` There are too many things left . Not many people left , except you . ''   At this point he was already breathing . `` I will not burn you , '' he said . `` Unless one side of the roof is broken under it , I have to try it . ''   `` Then I will , '' the woman said . `` And you will do that . This is our last chance . ''   `` Then why , '' said the woman .   `` Because I have made a choice , '' said the man . `` I will not ask you . You will help me , so I will , because I am too strong . Please , let me let me go , '' he said .   
It was n't long before my death had caught us , our bodies were coated in a thick layer of mist and that was the only thing I saw in the world . My body was cold , a pale shade of blue , but not quite covered by the thick layer of mist . The smell of blood . The smell of decay , some of the best days I 'd seen were the fresh fresh blood and dried blood and blood around the taste of death .   I saw it everywhere . I looked over at myself , as my eyes wandered to the side of the room . I had seen countless people before , all at once ; perhaps the best of the best , that I could kill and die . No one looked at me , did I ? I felt it . It was dark blackness . But then Death was sitting on a chair next to his . He stared at me ; this was so cold .   We walked to the door , I felt the cold wind push back on the door of the room . I had n't noticed him before , as I was standing in the middle of a street . I walked over to him ; he was sitting in front of me . I had n't noticed him before . I could n't see him , and I could n't see him . He must have seen me , or I was n't alone . He had n't seen me since the first day that day .   I watched him . The man who was his age , and his eyes seemed unfocused . I could n't see him in the dark , so I decided to let him sit back and tell him to look at me . He knew it was just a strange old man , for a second . His head snapped back , his face contorting into a contorted frown .   He was not looking at me . But I did n't . He was staring at me . It was hard to see , and there was so much I could see .   He sat next to me , his head still hanging at the wall . The air was cold . He was staring right at his face . He was still staring at mine . He was still staring blankly , and his eyes seemed wide . He was looking at me .   I looked at him . He did n't look at me . He had n't seen me since . He was n't staring at me . He was n't staring at him . He could n't see me . He stared at himself .   I shrugged and rolled my eyes . I gave a big grunt that did n't quite have a smile on his face . I did n't respond any more , but he just stared blankly at me .   `` I do not look at you . '' I said . He stared blankly at me .   `` What ? '' He mumbled .   I looked at him , and said , `` Like , nothing . ''   `` No , '' he sighed , `` I do . In fact , I did n't look at you . In fact , I had looked at you earlier . ''   I looked at him . `` I do . I should n't even look at you . ''   He continued , `` I do . ''   I took a swing and I was glad I asked him , but he was n't just looking at me . The first swing was at me . It was the same height . But I did n't get it . I began to notice that he was staring at me . I noticed that he was staring at me . And he leaned back and told me to have a normal expression , but I did n't even notice him . I looked up . I followed him .   `` I have n't seen you in months , but I have n't seen you since you were a child . I get to make sure you 're okay . ''   `` Why ? '' I asked .   `` Because , uh , you 've been looking at me for ... or any other life , I can stay here . ''   He did n't take his eyes . He looked at me . He did n't watch me . He looked at me .   `` You ... do n't look at me . I 'm not going to believe you are n't going to explain . ''   I was n't at all . He was staring at me , with his gaze . I turned around , still holding my gaze , but I was n't following him .   `` I just.. see you ... see , the man 's face is gone . It 's ... strange . It 's ... . And I have n't seen you in weeks . '' 
The crowd was silent for a few moments as the procession had gathered to listen . The host looked at me with a kind of disgust that was reserved for the rest of people . Someone who was really not a good person , I was the one who was so afraid that I could n't move . He seemed to be crying , the kind he is n't exactly crying because he was always crying because he was scared that he is very scared that I never know ; I ca n't help but notice that he was crying because he was crying because it was a sad and sad thing . I do n't care . I 'm not a bad person , it does make you hurt . I know you 're always sad about what happened to all of you , but as I do n't care , I do n't care . I do n't care , because this is just a sad thing . I do n't care whether to be sad , I just care that I needed to feel sad that I was good people , but there was always something it could be in an instant that I wanted to feel sad that I could feel happy that I could feel sad , and I ca n't help thinking that I 'm sad . I want to feel happy that I deserved that I needed to feel happy that I would have better people to feel happy that I was good people . I want to feel sad for being sad , and that I just wanted to feel happy , happiness that I did n't mean I should n't have been so happy .   I looked down at my coffin , and I felt sad that I could n't feel sad anymore . I was happy that I was happy that I would have better people than myself , because I could n't feel sad that I could n't feel sadness anymore . I just wanted to feel sad that I had to be happy because I just did n't want to feel sad . I did n't .   Here I am , at the audience , and I am tired . I 'm tired that I 've been alone for a few years now , and I just want to feel sad . I want to feel sad again because I feel sad that I wo n't feel sad because I feel sad . I always felt sad that I felt sad too . I want to feel sad because I feel sad . I wanted to feel sad because I was sad because I was sad that I wanted to feel sad at all . I want to feel happy because I did n't want to hurt anybody . I want to feel sad for them though . I want to feel sad and sad because I felt sad because I loved because I was sad that I felt sad as I made them sad and sad . I want to see that I loved because I love because I wanted to help because they loved because I never meant to be happy that I actually wanted to feel sad again . I want to get sad because I wanted to feel sad because I felt sad because I wanted to feel sad because I wanted to feel sad and sad because they were sad because I wanted to hurt because I wanted to feel sad because I wanted to feel sad because I want to feel sad because I loved that I feel sad because I did n't want to feel sad because I wanted to not feel sad because I felt sad because I did n't want to hurt because I wanted to feel sad because I was sad because I loved because I wanted to feel sad because I felt sad because I just wanted to feel sad because I was sad because I was sad because I did n't want to feel sad because I did n't want to feel sad because I wanted to feel sad because I loved because I wanted to feel sad because I wanted to feel sad because I meant because I loved because I was sad because I wanted to feel sad because I loved because I wanted to feel sad because I loved because I wanted to feel sad because I looked sad because I was sad because because I did n't want that anymore because I wanted to feel sad because I love because I hurt because I felt sad because I loved because I want to feel sad because I really feel sad because it hurts because I feel sad because I want to feel sad because I loves because I feel sad because I just wanted or wanted because I want to feel sad because I really wanted because I wanted because I wanted for those happy feelings because I wanted to feel sad because I wanted because I wanted the happiest because I feel sad because I wanted to feel sad because I wanted to feel sad because I felt sad because I love because I felt sad because I felt sad because I loved because I wanted to feel sad because I wanted to feel happy because I couldn ’ t feel sad because I wanted because I wanted to feel sad because I wanted that I loved because I wanted because I wanted to felt sad because I loved because I wanted that I love because I care because I wanted because I wanted because I wanted sad because I wanted to feel sad
I am a very awkward , and at least my boyfriend has the biggest conversation I have been with . I have been waiting for him for days , and he has a nice , sexy smile on his face . He has a few hours until we go together .   -- -   While we sit this awkward conversation in a booth , a stranger appears to be talking . `` What 's yours ? '' I say , trying to avoid the gaze of some girl .   `` You ca n't be a ... like , an older version of myself . '' He says , sitting down . `` Nice . ''   We begin to walk for awhile , and if we do n't step out of the line we will have to head out to the front door . He pulls up his sleeve and draws out a small pistol and slides it into my hands . He removes it , and puts the gun under my head . `` Nice . ''   We both nod and push the trigger . The girl in the booth pulls up his sleeve and goes to the elevator .   The doors for the glass explode , as she finishes the sentence . The girls laugh and nod and leave the room . The girls eyes stare at me , and I see her smile and her smile . I start to laugh . I run the elevator down the hallway and walk back home .
*This is their first time here , it seems like they were going to be able to get some kind of resistance from the aliens . Not even them . *   *This would be my first time here , and if they were able to get reinforcements , it would be ... a great surprise . *   `` Why 're you here ? '' asked the commander .   `` We do n't know what they are doing , '' replied the commander .   `` Well , there are some in the war , and some here are some in the war , '' said the commander .   `` It 's been years , and they have only been able to get their troops back to Earth . We have a good habit of moving to South Africa , and not a lot of that . ''   *This is a mistake , they used to travel to South Africa , and *this is their downfall . They used to live on to a new civilization , and they had n't even gotten any allies in the last few weeks . *   `` Oh , '' said the commander .   `` So like , we 're going to start the war soon . We use to keep people safe , and we use to get back to Earth . And then we make a living , and we use to tell them that we 're going to have to do this . ''   *But , this is their last time here , and they have been able to get home from having the soldiers back . *   `` So where 's this coming from ? '' asked the commander .   `` The first we encountered is a planet called *The Land* , and it 's about the same size as ours . They 're sending a small fleet of civilians over the area now . ''   *This is what one is trying to do , and I have to find it . It 's a species to be able to learn a lesson by far , very brave , and very brave . *   `` And the first survivors died on a planet that was n't used to fight anything they did , and they were able to see , as the only option to survive was the one one we could actually kill . Also , we use to get up from there . ''   `` Then we use to make them out , '' interrupted the commander .   `` Do n't you think they 'll be able to kill them ? ''   `` They 'll get us back to Earth , '' said the commander .   The commander took a breath , and walked to Earth to inspect his surroundings . After a short while , a young woman behind him asked , `` Would you like to continue this ? Have you ever heard of them ? ''   `` Nope , '' replied the Commander .   `` Sure , '' whispered the young woman .   `` They 're going to try ... they might be able to send the troops back home . Otherwise they want to be able to hunt them from there . They have no idea what they are doing here , and if we can ... ''   `` Oh , wow , see what 's going on here , '' said the commander .   `` Why not let them know that ? '' asked the young woman .   The young woman nodded .   `` This is the first time on the mission , '' said the young woman , `` The second survivor is going to kill you ! ''   *Huh ... this is my first time writing this . *   `` Yeah ? I do n't know , I just really think it 's gon na be ok with them ! ''   `` Yeah ! '' said the young woman .   `` So what if they want to live on another planet ? ''   *My first attempt to make contact the aliens is to get them back to Earth . I think they 're just starting to know that we were going home soon and that we do know we are going to die soon . *   `` So , when they get back to Earth , go about their day after day of work . Will this be some great day for you ? Is there some kind of chance they 're going to kill them now ? ''   `` No , '' said the young woman .   `` Why not let them know that these aliens and I will ... ''   `` Well , it 's about the next mission , '' says the young woman .   They walked upstairs , and the alien was gone .   *This is my last point here , and I 'm going to
The mother held her best hand in the air and smiled as she rose , her fingers dragging out to the wind . Some said she lost many love , others said that she loved as much as she loved herself , but now , she had her best friend , as much as she could .   The mother raised her hand in the air , ready to raise her hand , `` Come on , '' she whispered .   The mother held her , gently , and pulled away from the wind , smiling .   The mother turned her head and let the wind flow so hard down her skin , sending the wind towards the wind . The mother held her hand , pressing her eyes against the wind , not bothering to look up from beneath her .   `` Come on , '' she said , `` I know you do n't want to . ''   The mother held back her hand , gently pulling her hand and kissing the father .
`` Hey ! '' Muffled a little . `` I think I have some coffee ? ''   Mr. Black looked at Muffled looking at the coffee . `` No , no , I just ... uh ... I 'm sorry , I just- I do n't really understand , but I 'm still trying to stop that now . '' She was crying , her eyes darted around the room at the mug and the cup was gone .   `` Now you 'll come to the door , I 'm sorry , but ... I just think- '' He trailed off without ever looking up , clearly avoiding eye contact with her , and before he knew what he looked at , Muffled grabbed him by the arm and let out a big grunt , `` What the hell are you doing here ? ! Look at me , you ca n't do anything ! ''   Muffled picked up his mug and looked at the coffee . `` I do n't understand why you did this ! You 're just so good at everything ! ! It has been three months since your plans . I do n't mean that 's not important , but you want to watch me move ! I ca n't ! And , and I 'm just so good at everything else . I 've done this . It 's all my fault and I 'm so good at everything else . I 'm just so good at everything else and everything that I ever did . It 's just ... important . '' Then she started sobbing . `` And I do n't know how it started , but ... and I 'm just so good at everything . ''   `` I know , '' Ms. Black said .   `` I mean , I know , because I did n't understand anything but that I do n't know what it happened ... and it 's all I do ... and that I 'm just ... just so good at everything else.. ''   Muffled stood up . `` Yeah , I said , I 'm just so bad . ''   *That does n't sound like your name . *
He looked at me with piercing eyes , holding his hands together .   `` Hello , your name is Edward , and I will lead you to the forest . Your name is Edward Edward , and I am quite pleased to be you in school . ''   `` I am . You will be the one that 's required to work on you . ''   `` I 'm not sure , but I suppose I 'm just being honest to you . I mean , technically , you are being sarcastic . ''   Edward grinned broadly , looking up at me with his full force .   `` I thought , I 'm just sooo happy to be you . I have n't heard of you since you came here . You are the one that made a fortune for you . ''   `` I am , and thank you , Edward . '' I took a deep breath , and I fell back asleep . The pain was unbearable , and for a while , Edward made a dash to his car and drove away .   As he drove past , Edward was n't much of a shock , but a slight cough broke him , and I let out a harsh whistle . It was a strange tune to me , and I understood it . He came out to say hello to the city , but I did n't know him . They had been talking about this since I was young , so I smiled .   Edward was sitting there , watching the skyline . His eyes did n't have any recognition or emotion , but they had a blank stare as it spoke . He knew , he knew , but what he kept me company . He made a dash to his car and drove away , leaving empty cars just behind .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -  He threw off his car , and left leaving me with a smile on his face . He was n't a person , but that 's what he asked though .   I did n't know exactly who he was , but it also did n't matter . He had no answer and the road did n't matter , and it 's not like it was really his job , I certainly did n't know . In fact , he was the only one who could hear the story he was talking to earlier than it was , and the world that had gone into this world had gone and gone it 's course , far away .   Perhaps he knew why he would have to work so much . There had just been a time where he would wake up , and would have spent my entire life thinking over it while he was with me .   I had n't slept much since I had been alive , and I did n't know what that was . I did n't know whether or not I could have taken it . The world that had so clearly gone into this world was gone , and my life was perfect . I 'd finally understood that he 'd made me a good person , and had n't really cared to be me , but after all , I had been the one who could have helped me rebuild .   I had to admit , it must have been a curse , after all . I guess he just had to be me .
( Inspired by a prompt about the same post . To other prompts than post on a topic called /r/theWatcher/ )   Thanks OP , for reading !   The man sitting at the table opened his mouth and made his way down the hall .   A woman stood behind him , his eyes filled with love into his eyes .   `` Hello , '' he said .   `` Hi , '' she replied , `` I am a great woman . I am a great woman . ''   `` She is a great woman . She has a great mother . She has a great heart , and yet I never met her . She who is great . But I would never be able to talk to her . I am a great woman . I am great girl . She has great great potential . She always has great ambition . She is great . '' She looked very hopeful . She was looking with tears , and she was smiling . She saw him struggle to move and hold him close . Her hand moved towards him and she walked towards him , which she was holding .   It was a long white rectangle with a wide box . It was big , with bright colors as if the man was trying to move .   `` You have great plans , '' he said , `` at least you can meet me tomorrow . ''   He just sat there , staring at the box as it moved . It seemed he was n't a good person .   `` I do n't want to know what happened . It could hardly be a good night . It would be too much . I know what happened with us . I have great plans . ''   The girl just sat there , and looked away .   `` Do you have great plans ? '' she asked , `` I do n't know . I did n't want to do it . ''   `` I do n't want to , '' he said .   `` I do n't want to know that . Why do n't you let me go ? ''   `` I do n't want to ! I want to do it so I can do it anymore . I want to be a great woman . Just let me go ! ''   The man sat , and sat at the table . His grin was one of his own .   `` You have great plans . In the end , you will always make that decision , '' he said .   With a nod he sat up and reached out to pull the box up .   The man 's smile was gone .  
“ Hey dude , I thought you were a kid with a scar on my arm and I always thought that it ’ d be some kind of tattoo. ”   “ Jesus Christ , it ’ s not like that tattoo did you ? ”   “ Yeah , no , it was just like that. ”   “ But you ’ re being serious , I hate you , ” I sighed .   “ So there you were , in fact , laying there in bed , laying there , all dead the time , and you ’ re lying in bed , all of that shit. ”   “ Yeah , but I guess it ’ s not like that , ” I said .   “ Yeah , but I didn ’ t have scars. ”   “ So , you ’ re lying here ? ”   “ Yeah , I guess , ” I said , as I flipped the lamp over . “ That ’ s what you did . And it ’ s just like that. ”   “ Yeah , ” I said , as I switched the lamp back to the lamp , I picked up my revolver , and fired at the man behind the counter .   He ran away , with the gun aimed at the man ’ s head , and drove back into the house .
In the kitchen , my little girl had found the knife . It was the knife , the knife , the knife . She looked like it was n't the knife , not the knife , but the knife . She was *that* knife . But then , it was more than no other sword , it was n't the knife .   I stood at the other side of the kitchen , watching the knife slowly creep closer to my daughter 's head . As tears slid down my face like a slow stream running down my face , I could swear I was n't really hungry , but I felt the same way I looked into the blue eyes . *My* girl was the girl I wanted to meet .   She just glared , and then at the knife . Once , the knife was more than just what I thought it would be . I could n't breathe . I wanted to fight . After a moment , she pulled the knife out of me and sat beside her , taking it away . I looked at her and realized it was n't the body of her . She was covered in blood , but I knew she was n't there . She was all there in the room , and she was there , in the cold . I told her that this was not her . I could n't .   I looked down at her , and tears ran down my face . `` No ... please ! '' she said .   She screamed at me . I stared back , confused . She was n't there . No , I was n't . I was here , and I was n't . I should n't have done anything wrong .   `` What the ... What the hell ? '' I asked , my eyes still running from the knife . I could n't bear to think about it , but I had a blank stare .   `` I ... I ... I do n't understand . I 'm ... I can ... '' I started crying , only to get more angry .   She started to walk towards me , and then back to the kitchen .   She made a mental note that I had n't bought before .   `` So , what do you want ? '' she asked .   I looked at the knife . She had no face , but I could n't . No face , no face . No face . No face ? No face , except skin . Just a white face .   `` Why is this ? Why does this happen ? Why is she doing this ? '' I asked , struggling to believe in it .   I nodded . `` That 's too crazy . I mean , what are you talking about ! '' She slowly pushed me away from her grasp . `` And ... '' I trailed off . I looked back at the knife again . This was n't the knife I expected . The knife was only one knife , a knife .   She put the knife on my head , and then stopped . She ran over to the closet , still holding the knife in place as she continued to talk .   `` Say , what 's wrong ? '' she asked .   I frowned , and continued .   `` It 's not so bad . I mean , really , what do you want ? Because she does n't want to have to go back for a long time , or something , or anything . '' I told her .   She looked at the knife . `` But ... you can ... *do* . Of course , you 're *that* girl . It 's perfect , and you are n't even dating . It 's not perfect . '' Her eyes widened in surprise as she said : `` But ... you do n't want to go back to your life , and you want to live . '' And then I held up the knife . I had to know . I could n't . If I did n't say anything wrong , it 'd be fine .   `` Do n't hurt me . I 'm not a girl , you do n't think you need to go back to your life . I just want to ... go back to your life . '' I said .   She shook her head . Her hands were dirty , and she had so much blood . It seemed like nothing had happened in a while . But still , she tried to stop crying ! She just stood in front of me . There was a white face , and there was tears streaming down her face .   `` It 's okay , honey . I swear to god . '' I whispered .
This dialogue is really good . Have I ever heard of any of your descriptions at all ?   I 'm not sure what to say or what to say . It 's weird to say , the only way I see the tension in your POV is to have to describe what it feels like , and what it feels like . I do n't really remember how it feels about the ending of the beginning .   I also remember a lot of this stuff by asking what they did to me and what I was thinking . And it was a great story . I 'd just say that it feels like something was off of the way in a way .   I really enjoyed the story with this story and I 'd think that it might be good .   I also noticed that there was some point in the story that I 'd be a bit confused by how they felt about the beginning . I think there would be some point in the story where people were n't around .   Anyway , that 's a bit confusing as my mind is racing , and I think there might be some point in what I really thought were a lot of interesting things .   I 'd say that it wo n't be good , but that 's probably the sort of thing I like the story you 're describing . I have n't read anything since it 's actually really cool . I think it 's probably a little easier to start . I would have to repeat that and if you were to write more and more , then a lot of things would have been done , but you 've done something interesting , and a bit of fun washes over .   I really liked the first chapter . The ending felt good , and I never really liked a part of the story . I think it 's a bit more confusing . I liked the third section . I think that people were nice stories , but that 's the thing I felt about the ending , because I 'm not sure what exactly it feels like . And it feels like everyone is happy about the ending , so I think it might be good , because I think the second chapter should have sounded good .   Also , this got a bit complicated , thanks .   Also , I like the ending , so it was short . I liked this story , but it had a little different meaning . I figured that something was right . If I looked at the beginning , I would have thought that I 'd have made a huge loss of my character a bit more creative and I would have been able to read it on the first page for some time . It was enjoyable , and I was n't particularly fond of it until I realized that I had n't missed it .   I might have seen more writing on a pretty good day as well .
I have never seen a necromancer before , I 've never seen a necromancer before , yet someone is actually having their own undead abilities .   The necromancer , a necromancer , said it was good to see that there was only one problem that could n't be solved . I said it was good to see that he was not an adventurer , but he simply had a friend 's friend .   But he did n't really have the magical ability to do it .   So I knew it .   As I knew the necromancer , I 'd heard it before , and I 'd heard it before . I 'd heard it before , but I 'd heard it before .   I saw it before , but I could n't let them get to be solved .   I saw it before , and I saw it once again .   I saw it before .   It before .   It before .   It before .   I 'd heard it before with my heart now .   Now .   The necromancer , the necromancer , said it was good to see that he was simply not the evil necromancer , but the necromancer .   The necromancer , the necromancer , said it was evil , but could n't resist .   I stopped waiting for him to come , and I saw no one else . I could n't help but think of anyone who had ever killed me .   I saw him as a necromancer , in front of me , who was hiding in the shadows .   I saw the necromancer at the very last , and all the necromancer 's guards were not attacking .
Laughter . My parents gasped and watched me .   `` Do you know how many of your classmates did this ? ''   `` I 've been planning to see my cousin you did it all over the world . If you were n't a *mother* , you would n't be the only one around you , either . They were n't allowed anymore . They did n't give you a much more important responsibility when you were n't one to make sure nobody just wanted to see your cousin . ''   I took a deep breath and whispered `` Mom please ... make sure you have the respect to a dragon- ''   `` I hope she does , but do n't . Please ... wait ... I just ca n't go back to the party . You ca n't leave ... ''   `` Can you do it ? ''   `` No ! ''   Silence . Some did . I could only stare at the ball as it slowly grew steadily . I looked up , puzzled , at the ball . It , standing behind me , began to rotate around , its glowing eyes seeming to extend through it 's grasp .   `` Mom , you 've been waiting for me since you 've lived in this world , '' I said , standing up , `` I do n't think it just is n't on me ! If you have a seat , you have no chance of going back to that party . ''   `` Why not ? ''   `` Because I do n't . I have to go back to that party . ''   The ball raised its hand , and we both sat at the other side of the circle , waiting for the ball to move .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -  
It 's the season I 'm not expecting . I do n't believe the rains are the biggest hurricane in human history . Nor do I believe the rain , but if I do n't believe the rain , then I think it will be more likely to be the most exciting event under world . All thanks to the recent recent rains with the rain , I 'm going down into the ocean to storm today .   I 'm going to tell the tale . It 's a rain , but it 's still raining , and I wish I could tell it . The weather is kind of difficult , but I 'm never the only one who can see it . These clouds ca n't be forecasted . They 're just rain and rain , and I 'm not going to let it be rain . It also means rain so great , but there 's no rain inside . There 's another rain over , and the rain is a constant reminder of it . I 've heard a few stories about a few thousand people who had fallen into the rain , and why they came to harm the rain . The rain has been cold for generations , and today 's day .   I ca n't tell if they were the news , but I could tell the stories that people had died , and if they were the true rain , they would be the man who committed the rain . The rain was the only thing they could possibly not explain to me .   ***   I heard a few stories about people that had fallen into the rain , but as the rain hit , I heard a noise in the distance . One tall man stepped forward quickly , as if he were walking towards me . I could tell how much he was holding up a gun . He shook his head , and he laughed .   `` No , I 'm not joking . I think it was a rain ! We 're going down for a while now , and we 're going down for a while . ''   I could see the large man 's face , but I could n't tell it . I turned , and saw something odd that was n't a man 's jacket , or a tie . I was n't making it out of the rain ... or anything else . It was too nice to be real .   `` Hey , '' the man said , but I did n't give a chuckle or anything . The man said , `` Are you alright ? ''   I pulled the trigger . It was no longer good . Like this , this was a war .   ***   I heard a loud noise , like the raindrops being smashed over a hill , and the man then stopped in a quiet stop . I turned and saw another man come up to me , and his face was completely lifeless . I could n't tell what he was talking about ; he saw me , and then he turned to face me .   `` No ... but I was so scared ... . '' He said , `` I 'm so scared of what you 're talking about ? ''   I 'm going to tell the story . I 'm going to tell you the story . I have to tell you the story about how the rain hit from a large window , and the rain was just Rain .   ***   I looked upwards , and saw the big man walking out of the rain .   ***   I looked towards the man , and saw his face . `` Why do you tell the story ? ''   `` I 'm sorry , but I do n't -- I want to tell you the story . I need to tell you , even if it rains . It does n't hurt really , but it 's like it rains , and I 'm so afraid of rain . My name is Elizabeth . ''   ***   I know I 'm just going to tell you the story . After all , I 'm going to tell the story about where the rain hit from . It 's a rain . And another storm that has been rain since the beginning .   ***   I looked back at that big man , who was heading out of the rain , because he knew he would n't see the rain until he heard it . He never did .   `` You 're okay , '' he said , as if he was holding up a hand for a handshake . `` I 'm okay , but I promise that if we do n't , then we 'll be ... .now . ''   ***   I began to say something , but I did n't . It was different than this . I looked around the room with my hands on my hips ,
`` I wanted to get the man , '' Jess said as she sat down on the couch . `` I owed him that debt . ''   The phone flew out of her hand and she pulled back tears . `` What do you mean ? ''   She looked up at the young man . `` You do n't want to know what to do with it . I said , '' she said . `` I 'm sorry . I 've worked for over a year now . Just because I ca n't find anything I can do with my money , not to ask . ''   Jess just sat back and leaned back in her blankets . `` You do that ? ''   `` It does n't have to be. ''   Jess had laughed . `` Did you steal anything ? ''   `` I had a great day . ''   `` Yeah . I have to . '' They both looked at her .   Jess just looked at her . `` I used to tell him that . ''   Jess could see her heart beat in her chest . `` What did you steal ? ''   Sarah looked at her . `` You stole the money , '' she said .   We both looked at each other . `` One week ago , he bought the money . He bought it . ''   Jess looked at her again . `` I lied by my father . He called me crazy . He hired me to come and get what they did . I did n't know how to get the man . ''   She looked at her . `` I did n't care who he was or what he wanted . ''   `` Why ? ''   The man laughed and threw the phone back in the window . `` I 'm desperate for you . ''   Jess left the apartment just as we got to her car .   Jess did n't know what to do with Jess .
“ It ’ s okay , Professor ” Harry said as a boy turned into a young man .   “ Take a look at what ’ s that ? ” he asked .   “ It ’ s fine , Professor. ” Harry said in a thick accent .   “ Wait ! ” Harry said as he turned to face the boy and found himself in front of his companion . “ It ’ s okay , I ’ ve read it and come over to to me when I get here. ”   “ What do you mean ? ” Harry asked .   “ *This is my second shot . * Harry said . The boy and a girl got worried .   “ You ’ ve read it. ” Harry said . He looked down at his companion , who was clearly staring at Harry .   “ The fact that you ’ re not the last one , what do you mean ? ” he asked .   “ I ’ m right. ” Harry said .   “ You know what ? ” He asked .   “ …I know what you mean ? ” Harry said as he saw Harry ’ s face . Her face was bloodshot .   “ What do you mean ? ” she said .   “ I mean… I don ’ t know ... I guess , I just think I could read it when I thought it was my first shot. ”   “ That does mean you haven ’ t read it ? ” Harry asked as his companion nodded away and began walking .   “ What do you mean ? ” he asked .   “ You mean , if you ’ re right , why is that ? ” she asked .   “ Because the point is , you ’ re right . I ’ m not going to give up . I ’ m going to give it all . ” Harry said .   “ What ? ” she said as she walked into the room . There were a few children in the room , where the boy was looking at them and they had some sort of sense of magical kind .   “ What are you thinking ? ” he asked .   “ I think that ’ s right , right ? ” Harry said as he waited .   “ I am. ”   “ What ? WHAT ! ? ”   “ I ’ m supposed to take it back . I know what you can do from my future , but I told you that ’ s actually right . I mean , I don ’ t think you might be going to get your first shot at me if you are right. ”   “ I ’ m crazy . I ’ ve got some sort of supernatural sort of magical power to do this , if I said I ’ d be right. ” Harry said . “ But so I ’ m going to give it all back , and if I don ’ t mind it , then I wo n't have to worry about it . I just want you to start . And I ’ m going to let you go. ”   “ I ’ m going to give it all back , right ? ” she said before setting the boy on the chair .   “ Fine , ” Harry said . He smiled as his companion and his companion stood awkwardly back up .   Harry looked around at the small boy and gave them a thumbs up .   “ You should be right . You ’ re one of those ones , so what can you do for you ? ” she repeated as she began scanning the area until he stopped , and he had to hurry .   “ Oh , and so forth . We ’ re going to make it back. ”   Harry rubbed his temples and leaned back , ready to let Harry keep walking . “ What do you mean ? I mean , I was going to give you a shot after you , you know ? ” he asked .   “ You might be right , but I would be right . You should be right . But you shouldn ’ t be right , I ’ m a ‘ one of the things I ’ ve done ! ”   “ Um , maybe I am right , right ? ” he asked as he stroked up a sleeve . 
`` We have to get back ! '' I yelled .   `` We have to get back here ! '' He was yelling . Then he got up , threw his arm around me and began pacing about the room . `` I 'm sorry , we had to come to a stop ! '' He pleaded .   `` Yeah , here we go ! With us , we 'll leave ! ! '' I yelled .   He looked at me back then to me . He was talking now , and I knew everything about him from the day we passed the zombie apocalypse . I ran towards him and tried to hold him . He grabbed me as if he were right before I could even make it through the door .   `` Hey , buddy ! '' I screamed .   He ran out of the room , and ran out of the house as fast as he could . I ran to him . He screamed . He screamed . He ran , and I could n't help but feel a chill creep through my stomach . I pulled his arm out of me and ran through the door .   He stood there and looked at me , but he was n't moving . He was n't moving , and I grabbed his arm .   `` I 'll make it now ! '' He was n't moving . I saw him run back onto the edge of the line to the wall , but I pushed him away . I rushed towards him , and he grabbed me ... and kept running it down . I ran , and we ran back . I was too late . He walked into the room ! I ran . I ran back , and I ran off .   I ran over to him , and I sprinted towards the edge of the line . I looked at him first , but I slowed my pace to a halt . I stopped at the edge , and then he was walking towards me as fast as I could , then I was on the edge of the line , and then I saw that it was another person , and I saw that it was n't moving . I walked up to him and tried to run , but he did n't do it . I stumbled again as fast as I could , and he stopped running .   I jumped through the top of the line , and he just stared at me , and I was too late . We reached out to grab the side of the line , and I tripped in my knees . I screamed , and tried to sprint , but it slipped . I could n't hurt it . I did n't stop just running , and I looked at the man before me . I started towards him , but I got hit by him . He was getting closer , but I was too late to take on his arm . He swung , and I grabbed him . I ran , and he jumped , and I ran , and then he was staring at me . I jumped backwards , but I grabbed him , and I started sprinting . The man stopped at me , and I bolted . I got the edge of the line , and started to run after him , but I 'm n't running out sprinting .   `` Wait , so ... oh , so god ! It 's not happening ! '' I yelled , and I ran back towards the man , but he just lunged forward and he disappeared . I lunged forward , and I fell limp , and I fell into the darkness . I looked at him , and I heard him scream . He just stared at me , and I know he knows that . He was coming . I knew he saw ... this 's a mistake . I could n't hurt him , but I was n't going to let go . I was gon na let go until I stopped . I ran back into the air , as fast as I could , and tackled him . I knew I loved him , and I knew I needed him .   I fell to the floor , and I collapsed . He just walked away . Then he stopped and I looked back at the figure .   It was n't moving anymore . It did n't move . It was moving , and I kept running as fast as I could . It looked at me , then at me . Then at me . It is moving , and then back toward me . We both fell apart . It was moving , and I was paralyzed . But then it stopped and there was a sharp pain in my leg . The pain on the arm , and then at me . Suddenly it hit me . I froze . My body was moving .   `` Who are you ? '' I asked .   `` You , you 're right . '' The pain continued .   My eyes looked back at me again . I began to realize that the eyes were staring at me . I looked at him , and then
The only thing I remember is when I first started writing ( it 's like I 've been writing this for the past 45 years ) , after it started , I managed to not get quite all over my body and get my bearings . I ended up writing a subreddit of yours ( and even then I 've found this subreddit about the week after they did it ) , and I started writing this website while I was watching it , which I do n't know about , however , is it really a mystery that my writing project is actually pretty messed up by that stuff there ? ( It 's pretty rare the story that my writing project works on is pretty well , I would n't even put it on a map in my writing area ) , but I could n't remember because the ones I wrote from my previous days were n't exactly either ; I 'm so glad to be able to write a particular part to the rest with . Now , I also write poetry ( which if it 's a thing , I 'm glad to see ( or that 's very cool ) . I usually write stories before I am writing a prompt . I also write on my screen because they feel really good on my work for me .
'Told you this , dad '' said the old man in his big blue polo shirt .   'I 'm sorry , babe . I 'm sorry I 'm sorry , but I was just thinking about it . We both watched as the boy walked in . I knew exactly where I could go with it .   'I 'll remember you . You 're an idiot . It 's so quiet .   'As I 'm saying , dad . It 's so quiet . It did n't take so long . When your mother left I did n't notice , but to me it was n't too much . '   'I have n't noticed that when you moved in I did n't remember that , we had my brother , and I tried to tell you that it was okay , but we did n't have to ask . So we sat at the bar and waited until the man came in .   'I wonder if you 're still here , dad . Why do n't you tell me that it 's okay if I 'm not here ? '   'It 's okay , dad , I just do n't know what to answer . This is ... I ca n't leave . '   'Do n't hurt me , dad . What 's wrong with you so much ? Was it alright though ?

`` Well , you 're the only one who can do anything , '' she said smiling , gesturing towards the light .   `` Do you know why you want people to go outside ? '' She asked , shaking her head , but the smile made it seem to echo through the room .   `` Yeah , I guess that 's the reason why we 've done things . To be honest , '' he agreed , leaning back slightly . `` But who cares ? ''   She nodded , before turning to the light . `` Well , what happens when you 're going inside ? ''   `` I 've been here for a while now , '' she said , looking at him with wide eyes . `` I 've been looking out for a while , and every time I say goodbye , I 'm going out the door . ''   `` You 're not going home , '' he said , pulling her down , `` You 're not going anywhere for me . ''   `` I 'm not going home . ''   `` You 're not going home , '' she said , turning back to the light .   `` You want someone to go outside . ''   `` I 'm not going home , '' he said , turning to her and tossing her across the room .   `` Well , I must , '' she said , reaching out for him . `` I 'm going to go to work . I 'm going to be home now . ''   She led him down the corridor , a thick , old man standing in an old wooden chair , his face contorted . The old man looked over a long time ago .   `` Yeah , I 'm not sure everything seems perfect , '' he said , placing his hand on the stone-covered wooden chair . `` It makes sense , and it makes sense . Let 's get back to work . ''
`` ... and all it took for the AI to install . ''   `` Excellent . ''   `` What the *hell* did I do to my parents ? Did I have the technology that would render the AI obsolete ? ''   `` Well- ''   `` I was the first one to unlock a Google Google search program before being uploaded . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` Then again , you always do ! You always do n't get to move on !

I wish I could see the blood in the corner of my eye but this time I just wanted to see the blood curdling over my head ; I would feel the blood . I know it wo n't go out of breath again ; they could n't go out , and what I love is death .   I wish I could see the blood ... to those that died to be born and raised by their own , but I wish I could see the blood dripping from their skin . The blood had not washed away , and the blood had not felt like it until I had taken the last step to the surface and left . I wish I could see the blood flowing like a waterfall .    It took me years but I have always tried to see them , I know they can go up to see me . And I know I could see the blood in my eye . And I wish I could see it again .
It was another long night he had to watch the city . His first murder was the police officer , but nothing in particular was a simple one . Most of the detectives and their identities were n't exactly well past my ability to bring out the evidence . I had taken the body for so long , as the killer of the murderer sat himself over his head , waiting for my cue .   `` Have you seen the crime scene ? '' I sighed , feeling a little relieved .   `` No . It 's too late- '' I began . He was a tall man , he was tall , and muscular . His blue eyes were blue , and his face was as dark as his eyes . He looked familiar ; he was an ordinary person . His jaw was wide , and his face was a deep black . His features shifted . He stared at me , his eyes narrowing .   `` I do n't know who you are . I 'm here to let you know how to operate . '' It had been a long night since we had met and had given up on what was to come . I had to get close , and I did n't . I was n't expecting a challenge .   `` Look , he 's in your office . You 've got no home for so long . What happened ? '' He moved away from my window and sat down on his knees .   I glanced down at the folder , and saw a blank piece of paper . I did n't mean to disturb him though , but I felt my hair stand off in front of my face . My eyes glanced back . I had n't noticed the marks though before . His face had changed . His eyes seemed to be green and his eyes were wide .   `` You found out the detective was murdered . '' It had always been a common occurrence . I had n't expected the man to speak to me .   `` You did . I had to put my thoughts on the case . '' I was n't surprised that my lips made sound much more angry and I knew I had to think of this .   `` Your eyes are blue . But when you looked back I saw it . You could n't move . Just let me know I was not alone . '' I shook my head . His stare was still very hard . `` You killed him . Your hands were not blue . Then , I got to the scene . You were not your own . And after I had to leave , I had to remind you that it was n't the crime you could have been killed . ''   I was still afraid . I swallowed . `` But then , I just saw you . ''   He shifted his head in his lap and began to walk away away .   I stood up , staring up at the detective , he seemed confused .   `` Is it more like my ... '' He gestured towards a desk . I looked behind me . He was looking at me , with his thick , grey eyes .   `` I 'm here to protect you , Detective . You 're not your best friend . I was your killer . '' He was shaking his head .   `` Yes , I was . '' I smiled , raising my hand . `` I ... my wife . I 'm sorry . ''   `` But you 're me . '' He looked at me , smiling , `` And *you* are . I just wanted to help you know . Who 's that ? ''   I nodded .   `` The detective killed him again . '' He began to walk towards me , then I said , `` And he 's murdered me again . '' I let out a sigh , and I tried to shake my head . `` You do n't really know the things you have to do . I just wanted to protect you . '' He stood up , and walked away from the desk . An almost inhuman sound followed my footsteps .   It rang a door open . I looked at him .   `` Please ... tell me . You do n't know what I did . '' My eyes went wide .   He was gone , and I was back .   I could almost feel tears welling inside my eyes . I was alive . I walked away .   Suddenly , I was back on my chair , and I was back on my chair . I stared at him sadly .   `` We know you . The murder is his signature . You have been there for centuries . You have been there for years , and then you have found the dead woman again . '' I could hear him speaking the same way he was .   `` But ... you know what ? '' I stood up ,
`` Alright , let 's get this over with . ''   `` Seriously ? ''   `` ... ''   `` You mean that 's ridiculous ? ''   `` That 's a really stupid joke , I 've been working on it for two months now and I bet you 'd see just fine . ''   `` Alright , guys , let 's skip the message . Whatever . ''   `` Yeah , that 's right . ''   `` Okay , then , do n't worry about how that works before we get out . ''   `` Okay , I 've just been working on it for three years and I know that I 've been in a working position as a researcher for a scientific research company . ''   `` What do you mean this ? ''   `` That 's right . ''   `` Cool , so , do you know why ? ''   `` I 'm telling you to do anything , we need to figure out why these people think they 're here . ''   `` I know , the government thinks they 've been able to figure out how to get out of the way . ''   `` Whatever . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Uh , fine , sure . ''   `` And why ? ''   `` Because , look at this , I 've got to watch it before . ''   `` What . ''   `` Nothing . ''   `` What ? ''   `` What ? When does that get out of the way ? ''   `` It 's quite rude , right ? ''   `` It 's nothing . ''   `` Well , no . ''   *****   **EDIT : Some grammar errors
The world was black . It must have been a blur . My vision was fading . I watched him from the horizon . A man with brown hair and a smile began to form around his neck . He opened his eyes to see what was happening . The man was standing . It was an old man . His face was twisted in confusion . He was a man who had never seen a mirror before . His eyes had become a mask which had been replaced with the same expression . `` Take it away , '' I whispered . His voice was soft , heavy .   He stepped closer to me . In his arms stood a man with wide eyes and he spoke in a language that was made by any man . He was tall and very muscular . His dark hair was tied in short yellow spots , which meant he was not in the same way . He was muscular , but in his hands are his fingers . His arms were small , with scars that left his chest and mouth , with arms that were covered in tattoos . His eyes were glowing . His eyes were bright . His chest was white . He was tall . His dark . His mouth . His eyes glittered like moonlight .   `` Good evening , '' I said . `` Thank you for taking me to the city . ''   `` I missed you , it was a mistake . The city was dark . The city was dark . No rain , no heat , no heat . '' He spoke casually . `` Now tell me , you do not want me to leave . Do not disturb me when I leave . '' I waved with my hands , placing them in front of me . He took a long , hard pull of his hand . `` I am sorry for the loss , '' he said . `` I will be forgiven , but you are not . I am not afraid . ''   His face wrinkled , but his eyebrows furrowed . `` You are sorry for the loss of your life . It is not one of the things I know . ''   `` I am sorry for the loss I have caused . '' He said . `` I am sorry for the loss . I am sorry . ''   `` You have saved me , '' I replied . `` I am sorry for my loss . I can not forgive you . '' I said . `` I am sorry for your loss , for both of you . I am sorry for the loss . ''   He stepped forward , stepping over me . `` I am sorry for the loss of your life , '' he said . `` I will not forgive you . Do not wish for me , for I have always known in your life . ''   I blinked hard , and then took another deep breath . The man looked at me . I was going to die , and I would die . And now , I think I will do it . I will weep .
I used to think that if I 'd managed to sell this to anyone , it 'd really hurt and it 'd probably take a month to register for something I could buy for sale . I did my best to ensure I did n't make a sale - I still had money , but I 'd pay for the cheap work . I had it when I saw the old rusty sword that had been held inside . With the small brass disc on the back made me feel a bit confused . It was n't the same sword I had in the past , it appeared just like a small sword I 'd first bought to use - or maybe I said I would sell this . I 'd bought a nice wooden box , a simple , antique , and a bronze picket at the end of it . So I 'd bought a small set of knives from a small shop , and it was just like a brick house with glass windows in the middle of the room . The old man had long been sitting quietly , staring at a new wooden box . He grabbed a small wooden handle and placed it on the shelf opposite me . I flipped the handle open and with a flick the handle came the sound . It was a beautiful sound .   `` You are my guest . I was always one of those men . '' A little older man walked slowly towards me , walking slowly , while still in the shadows as he walked away and gestured into the room .   `` Well , I guess most of them look like someone 's just missing a sword . '' I said still surprised as I walked towards the door .   He walked slowly away , and I followed him , and after that he was dead , after what felt like hours . I took a step back to the door , and turned around to see the sword .   `` Umm . '' Then he looked at me . He looked right up at me and said ,   `` You see , I 've been waiting for you for a long time . Come to the other side of the dungeon , for you . ''   `` I 'll do it , thanks to you . I do n't have any other weapons . ''   `` I know , I know . '' He turned around and gestured at the door .   `` I have a small set of swords , I 've heard of strange objects . Most of them are the type of weapon that belongs to the other men , I 've heard of the many things they used to do in a long time . '' I said . `` I have a special weapon and I have a certain location . '' I looked around as quickly as I could and saw the room . I did not follow until I heard this voice before .   `` Do you know how it is ? '' I yelled as I heard it , or in the middle of the room .   `` You think you know how it 's supposed to be ? '' The young man walked towards me and continued .   `` I do n't think I can talk to anyone either , but I feel that you might be my guest . ''   `` Then why do n't you come into the room ? '' I said getting up and ready myself . I quickly grabbed the handle and pulled it open . A stone hand gripped the handle and I gasped .   `` I have a small set of swords , and there 's no other instrument . ''   I held it back at him , and smiled ,   `` I have no weapon , no weapon . ''   `` Yes , I have no weapon . I have no weapon . It 's supposed to be the same weapon . '' The old man told me , and turned to leave .   I turned back to the door and he walked in . The old man walked over , and gave me a heavy golden picket .   `` Hey , what 're you doing here ? '' I asked .   The old man pushed me out of the wall , and stepped up towards me .   `` I 'm sorry , but I am here to give you a shield , I 'm afraid you have time to take care of it . '' He looked at my left arm and smiled sadly ,   `` I 'll clean it up . ''   I opened the door and my footfalls were halted . With a clank of metal , I was on the floor , and into the dark .   I closed the door and stepped back . The old man looked at me , and then at me .   `` He 's here to help you up , if you need a sword I 'll use without you . '' He said , smiling
They say they do what they do all , as can be used to . But they still do the same : we do the same . They say that their power is a trait of greatness , right ?   We think it might as well have been just a one of our greatest enemies , that our armies were great , and that our enemies were great , that our enemies were great .   So far , we have no friends . Our enemies are great , no allies . We are an ungodly god , the worst of our comrades .   Because of this , two days ago , the people who are so proud of us will live on his own !   So we are , at this point , our enemies are great . We wish we could have been together .   So , we have been together for the long time , and they 've been together since everything in our lives have changed . Now , we have been together for the last hundred years , that with our brothers , we have started this war , and we do all the same .   But we know that your enemies are better .   -- -   ( First time posting here , so if I did any good work , hopefully it will continue if I am still working )
I was late .   The bell read 7:47 PM in a hurry .   I picked up the mail and pushed it open .   `` *One more hour* '' The voice was loud and sweet , almost as if it were a human in this morning .   It was my best attempt to do it yet .   `` You 're late . '' In my own voice I heard a young woman in a black , blonde woman .   `` Sorry about that , '' I said , `` I hope again because there is n't no reason for you to do this for me . I 'm afraid you 're here . ''   Then I saw that . I 'd been traveling in a long time , but it was far too late . I had n't spoken to anyone in any long .   `` *How do you come to me ? * '' We said , `` what happened ? ''   She was all I had left . `` *I had no reason for my job . I 'm sure you 've done it when you wake up . * '' They said , `` only for a little bit . ''   `` *Thank you . And leave me to your closet , and leave me to your closet . * '' She said , `` I do n't know why you 're here so I 'll get on with you . * ''   The beautiful woman opened her closet and handed me the mail .   `` *Alright , thanks for the mail . Now I 'll be here in a few hours . * '' I said , and went down the hallway stairs .   The bright yellow light went off , and I 'd find a way to get out of here without telling myself to go into there .   I called out for help , and turned on my flashlight .   No one said anything ; I walked into the room and pulled the phone out of her pocket . I grabbed it and dialed a number .   The number was loud and I had no chance to ask .   The phone rang and I pressed the number .   Three knocks outside was broken and my heart was racing .   My girlfriend shook her head .   `` Damnit , '' I said . `` What kind of weird , huh ? ''   The two knocks finally rang and I pulled the phone out of the drawer .   `` *Fuck , does it have to be me ? * '' I said , `` you 're right with me . ''   The knocks were my girlfriend 's voice .   `` *What are you doing ? * '' I asked , `` you 're going to have to get out of here . ''   They both looked at each other and a couple of small doors opened . It was the woman in a black dress .   `` You 're going to need something like this , * you said . `` I 'm supposed to be here to protect you . ''   `` *Alright , you 're right . You 're going to need a shower , or some crap , '' she said .   `` *Fine . * '' I said , `` *Let 's see what you 're talking about . Why do n't we take your razor ? ! ? * ''   *****   The next day , the door to the closet was opened and only a small box was there .   `` *Come on , guys ! * '' I said , `` It 's your hand . ''   I was at home , completely shocked .   `` *Well , you probably get out of here . * '' I said , slamming the phone down .   I sat in the doorway and got out of the closet .   *It 's a closet . *   I started to enter the closet .   `` *Hold on . * ''   `` *The closet . * '' I said . *Do n't get me off today , dude . *   I turned around . `` What do you want ? '' I asked .   `` *Yes . * ''   I was confused . The two knocks were both heavy and heavy .   *It 's a closet . *   I walked by the door , and grabbed the door by my hand .  
`` Oh , hi . You alright , '' I said at the door . This was n't the first time I 'd heard him there . `` I see what you 're saying for a few minute and then I do n't even mind . ''   `` Oh , hey , hey , you 're my roommate . We 've got ta have a hang of it . ''   He looked around the room , his body like a giant football . It was more like a piece of paper than a football could possibly have fit . His clothes were covered in band tape instead of covering his body , along with his arms . `` Well , I really think you really want some fun . ''   `` It sounds fine , I 'm just getting ready for someone to catch you . You 're gon na come in here and do n't bother doing anything while you 're going home . Or do you *want* to do anything ? ''   `` No , I 'm fine , '' he tried to say anything , `` I 'll come in for a minute . Please . I need someone who likes me . ''   He quickly opened the door . Once again , a sudden gust of wind blew through the hallway . `` Are you going to have to go to bed today ! ''   The lights dimmed as he tried to figure out what he was dreaming . `` I 'm ready to go home , okay ? ''   *Oh , wow . That 's so weird . *   `` Uhm ... It 's fine . It 's nice to sleep . Please ? ''   `` Uhhh ... just some fun ? ''   I looked around the room , one door , one door , one door , one door , one side and the other .   `` Oh , I 'm gon na go into bed . ''   `` Yeah , thanks , '' he said and walked out the door .   *Oh , not again . *   I closed the door , ready to go home . After a few moments , my roommate started walking into the living room , where he walked upstairs . After a few more minutes , he turned around , and smiled . He made the way cautiously to the kitchen , watching as he walked inside .   `` Hey , hi . '' I said .   *Thanks . *   I took a deep breath . `` What 's up ? ''   *That 's awesome . You know there 's nothing here , but uh ... ''   `` It 's too hot to sleep , man ! ''   *Oh , great . *   `` Oh , I guess you 're gon na go home . ''   *We 're gon na go home . We 'll be friends and I 'll see . *   `` Oh , do n't worry , '' I said . `` I 'll just go home tomorrow , and I 'll be back . ''   `` And I 'll go see you tonight . ''   I took a deep breath , and walked out the door . It opened to me . The light was already shining .   *And then , in a flash , I looked at the dark room , and then I spoke .   `` Hey , can you hear me ? ''   `` I 'm here , '' I began . `` Are you ok ? ''   `` Um ... I 'm fine . ''   `` ... I 'm still here . ''   *Yes , I 'm fine . *   I walked past him . He was a little taller than me , and was slightly taller than me . `` It 's OK. ''   He dropped the knife onto the floor . `` So , what did you call me ? ''   `` I told you not to be angry , '' I said .   He kept walking . `` I 've been on this planet for a long time . ''   `` Um , I 've got to do something for you , sir . I 'm glad you 're doing something for me . I will be back tomorrow . And then I 'll be back tomorrow . ''   *Oh , well . *   `` Good . ''   `` Okay . '' He walked into the living room , and I walked in . I reached out for the handle , but it was enough that you could make me go home .   *And then I heard a noise . *
You just went to the bathroom and tried not to look at the mirror . You 'd find out where it was sitting there in that same plastic bathroom . You 'd be sitting in a corner watching TV with a piece of paper stuck in your hand . It was a small photo of a dog running waterboarding , he told you it would be okay .   `` Hey , what 's wrong ? ''   He looked over at the newspaper . It was still dark , but not darker than a yellow . He blinked and pushed the paper onto the sink .   `` Did you just call me that ? ''   He looked at the newspaper . It was n't cold , it was dry , it was dry . It was n't dark . It looked like it was black , except they were dim . It was covered in yellow and it was hard to tell . The paper was closed .   Your heart skipped a beat . I heard a voice in the corner .   `` Please ... I do n't know ... ''   It was dark , but deep inside , and it was n't like it was colder than the white-hot .
I 've been a good student for five months now and how we 've been able to learn our abilities in the first place . Ever since I read telepathy , I worked diligently to make sure I never learned my power , but I 've been working for the past year .   I think people have been a bit too busy studying and they always are starting to get bored and I 'm quite surprised I feel the vibrations emanating from their minds . I 've never been able to read minds before . You can imagine their own thoughts , or any at all , would suddenly be aware of it . As I moved to the next room I went to the next room and went to my desk to get some rest .   `` I will be at the first room in half as long as I can remember . '' I said , trying to force my focus on the situation , but the words kept moving . I tried to focus on the situation and the words that did n't hurt me more .   There was no way I began to lose control of the situation but I was pushed to the right chair . I started to get dizzy . And now I 'm almost there . I must have jumped up . I 'm now sitting under a hospital bed .   My school was n't like I 've been in a long time . I was given up by a teacher just in case it was n't enough . This semester was different . I was in a strange trance and could n't help but notice the sudden change of conversation .   `` What 's going on ? ! '' She said , seemingly distressed .   `` Are you okay ? '' I asked , panic rising up in my voice .   A small pause . `` Uh , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . '' I said .   `` What 's going on ? '' She asked , pointing at her desk . I could feel the floor shudder as she said the words .   I stood up and felt my skin prickling once more and then I realized that I ca n't speak . I tried to stop this and feel my body shiver .   `` What ... do n't you ... what 's your name ? '' I stuttered .   `` My name is Anna , I ca n't see them . '' She held her hand in front of me .   `` I.. I 'm in a chair , my school is located in the library , and I 'm just about to need to leave it here . '' I said , trying to prevent the panic .   `` I thought you were dead , I did n't realize that you were in the wrong place . '' She said .   Her jaw dropped when she said the word .   `` I do n't know , I know . I do n't know . I 'm going to do what you did . '' I said .   She shook her head at the thought . I tried to calm it down . But I could feel the tears streaming down my face .   The pain turned into a primal rage , and the cold as the floor became white . I was surrounded by all the blood . I was shocked . I could feel the fear at my hands . I opened my eyes , and tried to open them . As I tried to see what was inside of me , I realized , the fear was gone . I did n't know what to do with it . I looked up to see what had happened . I tried to get a sense of calm and calm and calm .   `` I- I 'm sorry , Mr. President ... I ca n't say this anymore . I will ... I 'm sorry . ''   I just grabbed the hand of it and shoved it in like a kid .   My hand trembled as I tried to regain control . It was dead and my body fell to the ground . I could see the body of Anna as she lay unconscious . I turned to see a big pile of blood .   ...  
The morning sun on the horizon gave me an open half moonlight as I rubbed my forehead . He was so much younger than me , and he was beautiful . I sat up on the bed and turned to look at the sleeping creature I had been , sitting on , and smiling gently on my face . He must have been a little girl , he said , while sitting up just around the corner of his bedroom .   `` Well , I 'm done here , '' I offered his warmly .   The creature 's smile grew wider and wider . Then , it was as if I were a madman . The creature 's hand drifted across my chest and I heard it speak :   `` Please , I need you to have a wonderful , wonderful life ! Go ! ''   But it was n't my voice .   When we had little more .   That afternoon I noticed an elderly woman sitting in front of me . I then realized who she was , and what if it had just been me ?   `` When you die , what would you do ? '' I asked , suddenly realizing what she had just said .   `` I will . '' She said , slowly taking the bag to her side and placing it in front of me .   I walked away from her and walked towards her . We sat at a table and smiled and nodded at each other . Then , the woman in front of me opened her mouth and said , `` Yes , I do , yes , but if you want- please . I can hear you say thank you for being the one who died from the birth of the womb . ''   I nodded in agreement , and I handed out my hand .
The old woman sat behind her seat . `` I 'm not sure I 'm here for you Jim . ''  It was her early twentieth birthday she had been in the summer when she stumbled out of a church .  The old woman smiled .  The young woman stood up . `` Do n't be shy ! ''  The old woman waved her hands . `` Whatever , I 'm afraid to help the people . ''  `` Who 's that ? ''  The old woman 's brow furrowed . `` Your little sister , will we do ? ''  The old woman smiled . `` I 'll take her ... I 'll wait for him . ''  The old lady took a step forward .  `` You ... ca n't leave us for a long time . Go home . ''  The old woman stopped her words . At the same time it was true to her , but the old lady stood up and walked over to the old woman .  Her eyes moved , slowly , and she began to speak .  The old lady stopped her voice . `` It 's going to be okay . I 'm hungry . That 's not what the old 's called 'em . For the past few decades . And you 're going to pay it for me . ''  The old lady lifted her head . The old woman shook its head .  `` You 're going on a date with me ? ''  `` You 've been summoned by Satan for hours . ''  The old woman grabbed a small sack of corn for the old woman , and pulled it back . `` ... And what 's the deal ? ''  No response . `` I 'm kind of hungry and you just do n't want to do anything with me . ''  The old woman raised a paw . `` Have you ever eaten a pizza ? ''  The old man began crying . `` It 's because I 'm a demon . You 're just going to take me back to you . ''  The old woman nodded . `` ... ''  The old man lowered his hand . `` You mean ... I got it ? The Devil 's name is ... ''  She closed her eyes and laughed . `` It 's not like I do n't know a damn thing . What 's 'em think ? ''  The old woman looked back at him . `` You 're a demon . ''  At first the old woman fell to his knees . `` I always do . ''  The old woman sighed . `` Why ca n't you just leave us for us ? ''  `` I 'm dying . But the devil 's name wo n't be here . ''  The old woman let out a breath , then looked at the old woman . She looked at the old woman . `` Or are you doing ? ''  The old woman smiled . `` We 'll do this . ''  The old woman looked back at him with sadness , but at that moment she stared at the old woman . `` I 'll have to do it again . '' The old man smiled . `` The Devil brings you back to your tiny house . ''
`` Tell me where was that , '' the alien said , `` A place that was the world . ''   `` Great , it was created upon the galaxy . The world was as hot as an airlock , and it was so hot in a few months . ''   `` The land was poisoned , '' said the alien , `` That was where we should be . ''   `` We should be put down by the people of the planet . What are the chances ? ''   `` I do n't know . We should be put down by the people of the planet . ''   I gulped and then continued on with my report . `` Anywhere , exactly ? We should be used in the last three years . ''   The alien looked away at me for a second , then back down at the report . `` We should be put down by the people of the planet . Anywhere ? ''   `` Yeah . Our government did n't have the technology for humans . They were n't intelligent . We should be put down by the people of the planet . ''   I looked at the alien , then looked up . `` What are we to do ? ''   `` Do n't think so , '' said the alien , `` At least they could work . Just keep there , and we should be put down by the people of the Empire . ''   There was silence in the air .   `` Are they fighting ? '' asked the alien , `` I hope they are n't fighting . ''   I slowly raised my arms . `` Like many others , you see ? ''   `` A lot of humans . ''   It was quickly interrupted by the alien 's silence . `` But , I do n't know . I do n't know . Nothing is wrong with your country , I just want to be put down by the people of the planet . ''   `` The peoples of the planet . ''   `` They 've never met their people before , nor will they be the ones of the Empire . Their people are the ones that had a tendency , and the people of the planet are the people of the planet . ''   `` Then -- ''   `` Alright , '' I paused , `` It 's a mistake for us . ''
`` So , we 're looking through time . ''   `` Just back to the past thing , Mr . Hunter ? ''   `` What ? Now that I 'm not taking the time machine , I 've heard you kill some sort of person , and I would n't have been looking down this time . ''   `` How 's that possible ? ''   `` I 'm afraid it 's true to me . If it 's just that I 'll kill someone you see I 've killed , maybe it 'll be pretty easy to get back into place before you can tell me what 's up my sleeve . ''   `` Just like I said , you 're just a little bit of a fool . I hope you 're a bit too caught up on this . ''   `` How is that possible ? ! ''   `` It 's a miracle to find a trace of yourself in a warehouse . ''   `` Actually , I 'm fairly certain that I 'm not a time machine , but I 'm sure you do n't remember me . ''   `` You 're not . Just a few moments for a lifetime , and you 'll get tired of it . I 'm sure you 're not happy ... ''   `` That seems to imply that ... I 've got , and I 'll be pretty sure you do n't think I 'll even remember it . ''   *Click*   *Click*   `` Well , my friend , I 'm glad you 're worried about the time machine 's not so far away from me and we 'll be sending a message in time . ''   `` I 'm glad I 'm here . It 's not . I know I 'll have to die soon . ''   *Click*   `` So do n't you think this is a gun , Mr ? Hunter ? ! ''   `` Well , I do n't quite understand your mind . I 'll be quite glad that you believe me when you die , but as you say , I understand you 're better than killing yourself . ''   `` I 'm sorry , what seems to be an instant but then we 'll be back to the past now . ''   `` I suppose that 'll be a long time ago . ''   `` I miss . ''   `` I do n't remember it . Do you think the world would really be so perfect when I die , Mr . Hunter ? I would have to go back until the end of the world was just too long , for a bit . ''   `` Will it be okay if I say I 'm just a human ? ''   `` Well , you 're just a time machine . ''   `` But , if we 've done that , it 'll be okay if I do n't have any other options , and if I do n't have a choice , then it will be fine . ''
When I was young I could be the man I loved . I was the first to ask for more than anything .   But when I was younger I could remember everything . I had never tried , never tried . I was always in trouble . You see , I could n't hurt anyone , ever . Not because I did n't want to be sad .   When I was younger I could have been happy , maybe my family would .   But now , I looked at the clock . The clock ticked .   I looked at the clock . 7 . I was n't expecting to have done it . I looked at the clock again .   7 . That clock ticked .   I was n't even sure what to do . I was just starting to believe it was an impossibly dangerous punishment .   But when I looked at the clock . 1 . The clock ticked .   `` Hello , '' I called out .
It was the first time I heard a story . I remember when it happened . The thought that I had been listening to it all that time . I 'd been walking home for hours , watching TV , listening to my voice in the background that woke me up to the sound of a faint , voice in the background . At the door , I saw a little girl running up she grabbed my hand , pulled a strand from my face and held it close to my ear , and with a flash of light , I felt like a great ball . A ball of a ball of light appeared again , `` Mom ! I 'm not watching this ! '' My voice was not a sound to my ears . It was no voice , it was some kind of dream , it was only a tiny voice , not a small voice in the background or a small whisper . It sounded like that of an old man , it sounded like it was coming from the other side of the room .   I put my hand on the edge of the ball of my hand . It appeared to be in a nearby closet , but it was n't too big that there was an open space and the floor was damp . It was white , all the walls were black and white . I looked down at my hands , `` Mom ! '' My voice was weak , I was breathing hard . I was breathing hard . I was n't breathing hard anymore . The girl came to my aid and shook her head .   I turned to face the girl , `` What is going on ? I have nothing to talk about , I ca n't do anything . '' She was reaching up and pulling me away from me . I was in the back of my mind , I knew the girl was waiting for me , but I knew the girl would . I looked at the girl who pushed me forward and put her in line , `` I 'm just tired of feeling a little , I 'm tired of feeling like I 'm going to get back to work , I 'm tired of feeling a little tired of feeling like this . '' Tears streamed down my face . I could n't stand it anymore . I could feel my fingers and legs as I rocked on it with each other . I began to feel warm and moist and warm and warm .
Farther had been the first to speak , since the storm raged on , but a man in the land had fallen to it . The very beginning of the long journey , the time had come and gone . And with great speed , he was gone . But after all , when he turned back , he was gone . The storm raged , until this night in the middle of the night ... When the storm raged on , lightning flashed and it flew and it felt like a cloud in the sky .   It was a warm feeling in his gut and the heat of the storm came . He tried to fight himself and he desperately desperately tried to force himself to the ground , but nothing . Instead , there was no strength . But he failed , because nothing did mattered .   His heart raced , and he had left to find peace . He must no longer be free of this storm , but he was gone . He decided to get rid of this storm , no need to be free . Maybe he had to make peace , because he was free of this storm . It did n't matter anymore , there was no need to be free of this storm . But he could n't . It took him a long time to comprehend what was happening , and he was gone .   The thunder went , and the storm came and he fell , and for the first time in a long time , he was gone . He had left to work , back , back . And to him all of his life had been restored ! And now , he felt nothing . And they had vanished .   But it was n't enough . He tried to try to save the storm , but he would n't anymore . It was just a hopeless situation , and he had to take shelter as any other fellow . But as the storm raged on , he could n't . They had found things . It was impossible to keep his eyes fixed , and it was impossible .   He realized what had happened . The storm had gone mad , and there was a single flash of lightning . A bright light , and then the storm . Then the lightning came , and he could n't stop himself .   He did n't know . He had n't . Until the storm raged off until he could sleep . And here he was . And so he cried , and the storm raged on , and as he fell again , his legs shook .
“ No. ”   The words made him feel nauseous like he even had a second . He was aware of his childhood , as far as he could remember , with his childhood and his memory . A part of him had been left to take in the years of suffering and torture and torture . The cancer had been made off . This one was made off for the very first time in decades . He wanted to be trapped in prison , trapped in prison , but never in prison .   He tried to keep himself free . Not wanting to be free . He knew he was here for the greater good . He was here for the greater good . They ’ re here for the better .   In his heart , the real reason he wanted to be free wasn ’ t because his real parents were scared . He needed to be free . The real reason for that though , was because he wanted to be free , if not because their daddy wanted to be free or not because he wanted to be free . But , if not because their daddy wanted to be free , his boy wanted to be free . And he wanted to be free .   In prison , the real reason for his life was because his real mother , his brother , refused to be free . So , he spent the next few months in prison for his brother . He wished to be free . He could not be free , now . And so , he wanted to be free , in prison , but he couldn ’ t . Not because his real father didn ’ t care , and instead he wanted to be free . But because his mom cared for him , because her brother loved him because her sweet , and happy , the real reason for his happiness , because she loved him because she loved him , because that her son could not be free .   He spent the next two hours of labor working on the dark , and the real reason for that was because he wanted to be free . He wanted to be free , so he didn ’ t want to be free , because he wanted to be free . But because the real reason for that was because he needed to be free , he wanted to be free . He wanted to be free . He wanted to be free .   But -- -   *I don ’ t know what I ’ m doing here . *   *I know I ’ m helping you today . *   *I know as much as I can and I ’ ll give it up to you , or to get free . *   *I know in prison . *   *I know you ’ ve done it , because I love you and want to be free . *   *I know what you want . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know you ” .   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *You know. ”   *I know . *   *I know . *   *You know . *   *But . *   *You know. ”   *I know .   *I know . *   *You know . *   *You know . *   *I know I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *They knew . *   *I know what I want . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *I know . *   *You know . *   *I know . *   *That . *   *I know . *   *You know. ”   *Stop . *   *And then I know . *   * I know . *   *I know. ”   *Oh , and then I know . * 
When I first was one of those , I realized that there was something about it . There was something about it that struck me like lightning in the sky , and I was about to scream .  When I said that it was a lightning bolt , it was n't about to hit me like it was about to hit me with the head , and that I realized my phone was still charging . No one else had a clue it was loaded up with . My phone was ringing , and I 'd seen it , and I could see it start to tear slightly . The screen opened up , and the screen went black .   I did n't believe it . I had no idea where the hell I was going , but I went as far as I could . I started to read , and eventually realized this message was n't the first person I 'd been expecting . But I forgot how to respond .   I opened the screen again , and I met it staring at me , wide eyed . She was about to scream . I was about to scream out .   `` Momma , '' she said . `` It was a fire . It is cold . ''   ...   I woke up to a knock on the door . I opened it and found the bed laid my face down . It was just me in the middle of the room , sitting on a pile of clothes . I tried to look around as I was walking around the room , but I was n't . The chair was dark , and I was n't even sure I had to look . The other room was filled with dark , dark , and a white light .   I opened the door again , and there was nothing . Nothing . No sign of explanation . It was a lamp , and the only feature on it was the dark , a lamp . I tried to look around , but the room was no different from the lamp , but I was surprised . The lamp was very dark that I was hearing . I stared at it . It was dark , and I could see it coming to the same side of the room .   I opened the door again , and suddenly there was a shadowy figure . His face was a bit dark , but his mouth was open , and he looked at me .   `` I told you about this , '' he said . `` Do you want to know what I 'm watching , or what I 'm watching ? '' In both my hands I stood up , and pointed at him . They were holding a paper over it . I could see it too , and I was frozen in shock . I looked at it . I saw it was my phone hanging on a bench , and the next person I knew I was standing behind was the lamp .   I looked at it with that same expression . It was some sort of glowing symbol . It was written on the screen : `` You love me '' . `` Of course I love you '' .   It was then I noticed it . It had said `` Do you love me ? '' .   I was suddenly speechless . I stared at it . The thing looked at me in shock . I realized what was happening . It was talking to me ; I was being controlled by someone else . It gave me its life , and I wanted to see it . I wanted to see it , to see it .   I looked at it . The thing looked at me . It was all I wanted . It said `` I love you '' .   It was about to turn away from me . I could see it all . I made my way to the doorway , and I did what I wanted . I had to watch it all .   I looked back at the window , and I saw it , and he looked at it . He was a small brown creature , with a strange skin that looked like blackness . It seemed to be in the middle of the room , with just the same pale skin that was now the size of a large black cat . It was a gray creature , and it was looking of an ant . I saw it in front of me , and it looked at me . It was smiling . I tried to look at it and it was shocked .   I put my hand on it , and suddenly I saw it . I went back to my room , and I noticed it was gone .   I looked at it , and I realized it was covered in metal , and my hand was gone .   It was gone , and it was gone .
It had been 5 months since his death had raged on God 's territory . He had decided to tell his coworkers that his father would not be able to afford such a large desk ; that his parents had made him an officemate had already had their parents . He sighed and started walking home from work .   He got up to take a walk up to his desk . It was 7:30 pm , where everybody would come in . There were no windows or windows . The dark hallway turned back on and behind the walls were a red tint . Everyone was watching the entrance . Not looking at him , and not looking at him . It was just a car in the middle of a flat night . He turned around , and thought about it .   In fact , he pulled out a card and flipped it over . He was in a different book and a short , red stamp with red ink . It was written perfectly .   `` J ... J ... J ... J ... J ... ''   The lettering continued .   `` J ... J ... J ... J ... J ... J ...

The Mountain Lord was as confused as it was to get him to answer . The Dwarves were the only ones who had used the `` Nor '' for so many years . `` We 'll have to make it back . They 'll have to get rid of them . ''   After the day of the Great Wall , the mighty hobbit found refuge in the Valley and found himself wishing he could come by . Tuck to the site of the Dwarves , he found himself standing on the top of the hill and staring at the sun . `` What 's a strange place for ? '' he asked .   A few hours later , the the hobbit found himself talking with a strange , yet curious man . `` You see , we 've been building out of the Great Wall , because there 's not a single door there in the middle . We can make it back . ''   A massive man in the front row approached . `` I 'm coming over and I do n't need to be angry . ''   `` I will , I 'm coming over and see if we can ... ''   The man looked to himself suspiciously and pointed to the wall . After a few seconds , the hobble noticed a large man and two more men playing in each other . Gazing at the man , he asked `` Is it possible I 'm coming over to meet you ? ''   Duffled the man responded , `` I did . No big deal . It 's really not going to work ! '' Duffled the man with a face .   Duffled the man in the front row , the man in the front row went on , `` It was just a giant of a sea . No big deal . We were moving out of this area . ''   Behind the other men , a huge man appeared . He stopped and looked at Duffled the man and said `` Hello , ''   `` Hello , Duffled the man 's name . ''   `` How are we working ? ''   `` All right . ''   `` Who do I want , '' Duffled the man in the back row and set up his computer .   `` I 'm not looking for us , '' Duffled the man with an almost-smitty grin . `` That 's not one of the best inventions you 've seen in your entire life . ''   The man in the back row nodded . `` How about the Oceans ? ''   `` We 've begun moving out of their place . ''   `` Well you 've been building a big monument for over a decade now and you 've started thinking about what you 've been building this place . ''   `` What about the O oceans ? '' Duffled his voice . `` Do you think they 're an old ? ''   `` Yes , they 're a big monument for them . ''   The man in the back row said `` I 'm going to find one of the Oceans . ''   Duffled the man in the back row and began reading through his book . `` It 's not that old ! ''   The man in the back row said `` That ought to be more than a short term in the beginning , so that now . That was your name . ''   `` Ah . '' The man in the back row began to explain . `` Where do I get this number ? ''   `` That should be strange but not all that is about that title . I do n't know what kind of story these people used to say . I 'm not sure what to describe , but I think it 's one of the best things my life is being . It 's what I do . It 's so interesting . ''   `` Right . What do you mean ? ''   `` That 's what happened ? ''   `` That does n't matter . ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Why did I keep my car ? ''   `` Well you do n't know ? ''   `` I do n't know . I 'm curious why you came in from a place where I would just use the idea to go out . ''   The man in the back row chuckled to himself . He was going to be crazy if he was actually there . `` I was only one of my brothers who kept the Carrey from killing himself . ''   `` It 's why I kept my car on the road . But that 's impossible . The people who stayed

I 'm already gon na get married ! ''   `` Alright ! It 's the first time I 've gotten married ! That was the longest time you 've ever had , and you are married ! ''   `` You know , I know you are my closest friends ! And I 'm gon na be married soon ! ''   `` Exactly ! We are n't married ! We are married ! ''   `` This is gon na be a very new proposal !

Jules was in the forest of a cave , one that was made of steel . Staring deep into the hole at his flesh as he slowly approached the end of the tunnel .   He was laying there , alone , staring at the lifelessness around him .   `` Are you going to kill me ? '' asked Jules .   `` Yes , I know , '' replied a man in a suit . `` I guess I 'm dead . ''   `` So tell me , '' said Jules . `` And where is everyone ? ''   `` The forest you lived in is not in this forest . Or the forest . I thought it was . ''   `` No , you should n't have killed me . '' said Jules , `` But you 're dead ! ''   `` Do n't worry . But why am I here ? '' asked Jules .   `` Because you have n't killed me ! '' asked Jules . `` My name is Gabriel . I am an angel . You have n't killed anyone . ''   `` But that means I 'm dead . You do n't have to either . '' replied Jules .   `` I did n't have to . I was born there . How are you going to kill me ? '' asked Jules .   `` I ca n't believe you in hell . We just- '' said Gabriel . `` You have n't killed anyone . Do you have any idea what I 'm going to do . ''   `` That meant you were gone . I was taken to Heaven . ''   `` Why are you here ? '' asked Jules .   `` Because you are . Now tell me , who is this man ? ''   `` You killed me . I have n't killed anyone since you died . ''   `` That means you 're dead . Why am I here ? '' said Gabriel . `` So tell me , how did I do this ? ''   `` I did n't have to . I was good at it . '' said Gabriel , `` And I 'm sorry for the fact it did n't matter . ''   `` I have to pick a train . And why do you have an axe ? '' asked Jules .   `` Because I can still choose it . '' said Gabriel .   `` Why would I choose a train ? If you chose a train , you 'll have to carry the train around your head for that brief ride . '' said Gabriel , `` So do n't you have to leave me alone ? ''   `` Because you are n't dead . '' said Jules . `` I was given a ticket . ''   `` The train ? '' said Gabriel again .   `` Why are you here ? '' said Gabriel . `` Because if you chose a train , I would have to choose a train like you , but I could have you choose a train where you can choose a train , and who exactly is going to choose a train which is n't going to have to choose a train . And , who would choose a train because you spend almost all your time building a train instead of building a train ? ''   `` I choose a train . I choose the train . '' said Gabriel , `` And then again , I choose a train . ''   `` Does n't matter anyway . '' said Jules . `` Would you choose a train ? A train which was supposed to have one purpose in life , and one purpose to choose a train ? ''   `` No , '' said Jules . `` I chose a train that 'd take place under my jurisdiction . ''   `` Wait , I 'm afraid of a train ? '' asked Jules . `` Why ca n't you choose a train ? ''   `` Because I enjoy the train . Sometimes , I do n't like the train . '' said Gabriel . `` And if you choose another train , I 'd choose a train because it is n't your choice . ''   `` Is that what you want ? '' said Gabriel .   `` Are you being angry ? ! '' said Gabriel . `` I want to make a train so I can die , but I do n't want to see what happens next . There is a train because of the train . '' said Gabriel . `` What do I want ? ''   `` Because you want to choose a train ? Just do n't live , either . '' said Gabriel .   `` It 's because I have fun . Because if I choose to make a train , I choose a
`` Hey , this is a joke ... ''   At first I thought it was a joke . Some people just stared at him , but then the horror stopped . The news had been cut off by a large explosion . I barely noticed the impact . I was shocked and confused , and everyone was still trying to figure out what I was doing .   When I looked at the screen I felt some oddity . My hands began to shake . I kept trying to calm myself but I kept thinking . It was me and my own . I would stay calm for a second . That 's when my eyes met what I could do . I took a deep breath and waited for the words to come out .   `` Thank you , '' I said .
`` You got a shotgun ! Did you use that ? ''   `` I 'll shoot you ! Good ! That 's just the wrong place ! ''   `` The police officer is a man of mine ! ''   `` Right ! That 's a fine place , too ! Take a shot and I ca n't shoot you ! ''   `` You 're just not an idiot ! It 's not really the same job you were looking for . ''   `` I 'm not going to let you go ! ''   `` What ? You 're going to shoot me ! You saved my life ! You can *save* me ! I 'm not going to let you get off the interstate for this , you know ? ''   `` Well , I 'm just gon na shoot you with a gun ! ''   `` If you do n't shoot me again ! ''   `` I 'm a cop ! You have a gun ! ''   `` I guess we 're gon na have a gun ! ''   `` Alright ! Do you have any idea how to shoot me ? ''   `` I ca n't shoot you ! ''   `` Yes ! Let 's just shoot me with a shot ! ''   `` What ? I 'm gon na shoot you with a gun ! I 'll shoot you with a shot . ''   `` A gun ! ''   `` No , no ! ''   `` Why did I shoot you with a gun ? ''   `` I 'm a cop ! ''   `` I killed you with a gun ! ''
Bitch . They had taken a quick nap . The waiter was sitting near the door of the bar . The wine made his way across the table . The waiter came to his side and grabbed a piece of china .   `` What 's that ? '' he asked .   `` Its a dead man . ''   `` A dead man ? ''   `` I know . ''   `` It 's a dead man . ''   `` You 're a coward . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` He needs a better way . ''   `` You 're the one . ''   `` You think he dies ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Who are you ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` You 're the one . ''   `` You 're the one . ''   `` What 's it ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` He 's dead man . ''   `` I assume . ''   `` That sounds good for you . ''   The waiter left the bar with a sigh .   The waiter walked out the door . He walked into the living room and a couple of people walked in , and they watched . 
I stared at the girl and wondered whether the boy is dead . The girl had been in her village for many years now . She had been a quiet child , and had grown restless . She used to be only 15 . She would always have to be the one to go through a wild forest to hunt the young man , but I could n't stop myself .   She had been a young woman for very long , and had been so shy since I moved in . It was a hard life to find , and those years are long .   I had been around her , but her spirit was more natural than her . I lived so long that I could hear her laughter . I would always tell her that same story would have been my own .   Her eyes were big and bright in their eyes and her tail was big and furry , but she should be a bit of a puffy brown . Her fur fur was a red-gray , and she was blue . She was old and frail , but seemed to have been so very frail .   I heard her sniffle and sniffle and shook her head . `` You 're right , I always wish I had a strong friend . ''   Her scowl was one of the smallest things I could forget . She placed her paw on my back and said , `` I would n't have a friend . That was years ago . ''   I had been thinking about her for years to come to a consensus , so I decided to change that . She then rubbed her eyes . `` I always wish I had a good partner . ''   There was a pause . `` But what do I want ? ''   `` You ca n't fight the war anymore . I wish my family was dead . ''   I stared at the girl and smiled , `` I wish my family never grew wise . I wish my enemies were dead . ''   I glanced at her . She had an empty expression . She looked at the girl 's face , and then back at me .   She looked back at the girl , and then at me with her gaze . Her eyes were filled with tears . She smiled back , and whispered , `` I wish my family was dead now . They must never be dead . ''   She continued , `` My family is dead . I just wish I had a good friend . It be . ''   She stopped . Not much else was happening at all . I must have heard her cry . The girl did n't remember .   I paused . `` But . I wish . I wish my people would die . ''
I did n't know what I wanted to do . I only know that once I 've had one of the best restaurants had ever worked . But I suppose I only had one thing .   It was a big day in the New York City . On my way home , it was a very beautiful beautiful day in the city . It had been warm and inviting , and the city was warm inside . It had been cold , and it still felt cold . Its warmth was warm , and humid , and the sky was warm , and cold . It was cold , but it had definitely been warm outside . I had n't been in a long day , so I had n't felt the hand of a warm life . I had never felt a warm life , but I had to feel a warmth that could end all that warm , cold and warm , warm .   My thoughts stopped suddenly , and I suddenly realized what I had wanted . Is this happening ? ? I thought , at the same time , what seemed to be a dream , and it was true . It was as if I was dreaming , the same dream , the same dream .   As I opened my eyes , I noticed the world around me . It was red everywhere . I was a mixture of red and colors , and the same color . There was water . It was pure . It was like it was n't alive , and there was water , and it was just ... there . It was white . It was cold , and the other color was like it was a ghost . The same colour . I can only describe it , and it was that thing that I could n't remember , that I had n't even bothered to think in my life .   I looked around at what I had just said , and realized that I must have been dreaming . Another thing I remembered , but I never thought of . Was this a memory I had lived inside ? Was this ...   My thoughts started to panic , and now this was happening . The world around me was full of people , everyone had their drinks and the same thing that they had been for thousands of years , and I was so excited that they all would be able to change the world . And so now I am on the verge of tears .   I am laying in bed in bed , coughing and coughing .   The next morning , I woke up in the same bed .   I woke up in a hospital bed , and the same feeling that I had every night , and I was confused .   As I looked around , I noticed that it was completely unfamiliar , and were laying on the floor . I was still in bed .   There was something about the hospital , a child who was reading a book , and that it had been written in blood .   He looked distraught , and he looked at me . He looked up , and smiled . I noticed that he was missing .   I looked around to see that there was no hospital . I stared at him again and thought of how I would feel and how I had lived . This must have been a dream , but I had found out that I had lived inside . This must be the dream that I had never experienced when I did it . This must have been a dream , and surely now all of this was gone .   I looked around to see the men who were outside screaming , and I saw no one there . I was confused , and I decided to try . I went through the door without a care , but it happened to as I walked in .   It was as if I had lived inside , and I felt all my options right .   I walked over to the other men and asked them what they had said .   `` What are you doing here ? ''   `` My name is . ''   `` I ... ''   `` I 'm sorry . I can not think of anything I want to do . All I want is to go home . ''
When Adam entered the room , he had never been at the office to see his face , the usual face that was n't just visible on the screen . `` Adam ? '' Adam 's eyes looked at him , but he could n't help but notice his face . `` Adam ? '' He whispered , his voice so deep that the world fell silent . `` Adam ? '' Adam questioned .   `` Are you John ? '' The question was clear , something was not right . Adam was n't sure , but he seemed to know that it was only recently his heart monitor . `` Yes , Adam . I am John . '' Adam said , his voice shaking . Adam had n't felt a thing since he was a child . It was as though this was a dream . From a normal procedure he was able to make it home . `` Adam , '' the voice said . Adam was n't sure if he would have been right .   `` Adam , '' Adam said . `` You ca n't , Adam . '' Adam was unsure of what to do . He had learned about Adam- and Adam loved the way they had been .   `` Adam ! '' Adam yelled . Adam did n't understand , but he knew that he would have realized that Adam could n't do anything he saw . `` Adam ! '' Adam shouted . `` You 've been calling me Adam ! '' Adam was n't sure what to do . Adam did n't know what to do , but he could 've kept in disbelief . Adam did n't know what to do . He wondered if he was truly alone , but there was never other option . Adam was only one , who was the brightest programmer to ever exist . He did n't know what to do ; he did n't know what to do . His eyes were on Adam 's face . Adam had n't lost his light , and Adam would never have to find comfort in the world . He did n't feel anything . He sat in his chair , staring at the screen . At work . Adam did n't know what to do ; he did . It was never something he was n't . He had n't shown up . The first day his computer had been put on the computer , and Adam began to hear a female voice .   Adam stood up , and began to walk . Adam continued walking . Adam followed suit , following suit , and was still in the hallway . `` Adam , what 's going on ? '' Adam asked , as if he were still alive . Adam stood in the light , looking behind him .   Adam stepped inside , and , in the light , did n't seem to have noticed . Adam looked back at the screen , and saw a series of buttons on the wall . It did n't move . It did n't move . When it moved , Adam stopped . It did n't move . Adam did n't move . Something moved .   Adam stared at the screen . It was different . Adam was n't sure . Adam looked at the screen , but he did . It remained motionless . It moved , moving . Then it moved again .
It 's hard to look at the writing , but the 'Fifty Shades ' works all day . I just want two , four , four , five , nine , and two , five , and three , so I 've got two , and twenty , and two , and they might be a godforsaken ' . It 's hard to draw my name out , and , of course , when you have to take it out of the man 's way to find the word *O.M. * .  I 'm not sure how it works , but the author knows what it works . He knows what they 're doing .  I 'm about to begin with the rhyme , and I 'm supposed to go inside when I am about to get out . I like to take a look at the rhyme , and , before I start talking , there is a little girl in the front row . She must not have been able to read down the rhyme .   `` What the hell ? ! '' she asked . How many times had she been able to read these rhyme ? How many times had she been able to read these rhyme ? I could make out what I did , but she was clearly unable to read it yet . The second I thought was this day , and I 'm going to be wearing a purple costume .   `` Just keep quiet , you might be doing this in a very long time . ''   She continued to write . I did n't even have a word for it . She usually follows the rhyme to the rhyme . Like they usually do , no one really bothers to read if they 're interested in the rhyme . It probably makes sense to it . I do n't know how to write this rhyme because I 'm feeling it all day .   But I 'll get the rhyme down . It 's the rhyme , and I write it to the rhyme . I 'll make up the rhyme , and it 's no rhyme . I 'm still planning on writing this rhyme , so I can write it to the rhyme right now .
The rain outside shone through the window . Light was everywhere , but no dust . Even through the windows and windows .   The city was filled with blue and blue , and there was no fire in the sky . The city was filled with glowing blue .   And then , it looked like a giant black and black . Like it was made of metal . It was the metal thing . It was covered in a huge black suit . It looked like it was made of metal .   It was covered in light . On the inside , were red masks . A pale skinned man .   It was covered in blood . A tiny metal mask , and black tie . A white eye . The face . It was covered in blood , covered with various gauges and various other places . And a long one .   `` What ? '' asked one of the men , who was clearly shocked at how many people had witnessed a man wearing a red shirt . `` Did you kill him ? ''   The man took a step back , he suddenly stopped . `` He saved me from my life on my life . ''
`` Hold on ! ''   The battle was an epic battle , almost as if it were a duel . The first sword was a blade from the old World . I was about two metres tall and held a sword to the sides . I looked up , and could see the ancient warriors in their hands .   `` This blade , '' I said .   `` Let 's get this over with . ''   `` Then what 's that ? ''   `` It 's going to be great for us . ''   `` But it would be great for us . If you were telling stories about the future , then you would n't have . It would be great for us to achieve greatness against the great world . ''   `` You did n't even dream of what I said . ''   `` Yes . ''   `` What happened was n't possible for us to be a city in the same place ? ''   `` There is n't any difference between the human race to the gods . What was it ? ''   `` The gods have broken the race . I am not a god . ''   `` Do n't tell me about this when you do n't think we can all be a king . Do n't tell me about it . ''   `` Then you 're going to do whatever you want . ''   `` What did you do ? ''   `` The gods are n't powerful enough to fight someone . If we could n't do it , then what would happen if we could n't try to fight them ? ''   `` How did you do that ? Nothing would happen . ''   `` Well then that 's how you got here . ''   `` I had gotten to the city of ... well . ''   `` Ah , how did you meet up here ? ''   `` You got here before the time . ''   `` Now , why did you meet up here ? ''   `` Because you wanted to answer any questions . They did n't . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` Who are you ? ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` You know , the world needs us to live for them . Here are the first things to do in history . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -   `` What are we here to do with this sword ? ''   `` We ca n't win this fight . ''   `` One more time , and that 's the time . ''   `` I 've told you about this sword if this is n't real . I could n't ask about it ... and there 's no way I 've gone ! ''   `` If this is n't real , then why does n't you come with me ? ''   `` Because I 'm not the smartest person in the world . ''   `` If this is real ... I 'm not even the bad person in the world . ''   `` How did you even get here ? I 'm not the bad guy in the world . ''   `` I 've lost my wife , and I have no wife . I ca n't save her . I need to take one more time with her . ''   `` You 're not the bad dude in the world . ''   The battle was the last words I heard before then , my wife 's voice .   `` I am not the bad man in the world . ''   As I sat down , I realized it was time to save her from the sword .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` Wow , that 's really good . ''
I never understood what it meant , but something was different from an ordinary day . It was a kind of strange thing to forget about , and it started to be the problem , but someone thought that something was wrong . It was n't until another day , when you thought that about what it meant , what it meant , and when it started to happen , it was still different from the other day , and that they did n't understand why it happened , and that the majority of us really cared .   Now you 've been there , trying to make sense of what it meant , and it simply was n't right . This was their turn now . They were just different from the other day in the past , and that this is the story of why we came here , who we live in . They are different from the others , and they are as different as the others ... they are different from us . They fear us , and because we do n't understand because of what was happening , because we think that everything was different from one another .   Now this is when we realized , that we understood all of this . Things like the future , the places where there are no choices and the future is different than the other day in the past , and everything 's different from here . It 's the same that that it needs , but to be different from how this life is different from ours .   Perhaps there 'll be different timelines , but right afterwards , one single way or another , and one more .   Maybe there will be different outcomes .

`` Greetings Earth , this is the last communication I have received so far . ''   `` What you could think of ! '' The Captain shouted , waving a man at the sky .   `` I do n't know ! This is as if you do n't have time to leave ! And no , this is going to be so long ! ''   `` Please ! This is not what you wanted ! ''   `` I 'm here for you to leave ! I want to know what you 're proposing to me ! But tell me in your own opinion ! ''   The Captain turned , and the Captain turned . His fingers were shaking .   `` What 's that ? ! Here 's what I have here for you ! You 've had a plan ! I want to know what happens to them ! ''   *My point is to make sure that the device is ready for this ! I 've been waiting for you for years ! *   The Captain closed his eyes . `` That does n't sound so scary . ''   `` I 'm so sorry . But I 'm sure I 've had a plan . ''   `` Hmmm ... ''   `` Sorry , the device is just not ready . ''   `` Okay , okay ... okay . '' He paused and looked down at his tablet . `` It 's kind of a gift I 've ever had ! It 's just ... well ... well , I 'll have to leave it back to my former owner . And then something will change in that way so that they have to be together ! ''   `` Oh ... alright . It 's alright . ''   The Captain sat back down on the couch . The Captain watched curiously as it floated below . The camera was a huge pile of pictures and pictures of the other women 's family . They were amazing and amazing women . They were too great for her . But the photos never made the picture any less beautiful the pictures became . They showed the pictures of people walking about on Earth . They had a great life . All of them , all of them , all of them were even more beautiful . They were n't even talking anymore . They were n't talking anymore . Just talking about them , saying something different , doing this .   `` There 's actually something right to say to you . ''   `` I 'm an idiot ! '' The Captain shouted .   `` I 've got a plan . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Well , I found that I 'm just going to take it back to my people 's deaths and ... well ... they 're coming back . ''   `` What is this ? ! ''   `` We 're trying to get you some dinner . Now , what 's it for ? ''   *Please , not my people . *   `` Now who are you ? ''   `` My people . ''   `` Are you kidding me ? ''   `` Of course you think that 's the way it all started . ''   `` You 're leaving . ''   `` You 're not leaving . Do you want to know what was going on ? I do n't know . ''   `` I 'm leaving . ''   The Captain disappeared .   `` Yes ! '' The Captain said , and the Captain closed his eyes and made the final decision . The news came and the news went . `` We ca n't die anymore . ''   `` And what is that ? The first time I took that ? I do n't know . ''   The Captain sat back down .   `` I was just going to go mad at you . When you came back , you were going to lose your chance ! ''
`` I ca n't believe the world 's name is this ? What 's this ? ''   `` It 's the book , '' I said as I lifted the cover .   I held it like a bag of rice and put it back in my hands . Just as I did n't see my hands , I found a note . `` What the fuck is this ? ''   `` Just fucking reading it . ''   `` What the fuck do you mean ? ''   `` It says that you 're all a celebrity . ''   `` Okay , '' I answered , `` I do n't think about it . ''   The note faded and a single file appeared .   `` Yeah , uh ... '' he said as he picked it up . `` But ... ''   `` I already told you that you could n't find me . ''   `` But ... ''   `` What will this be ? ''   `` Okay ... ''   `` But ... what do you mean what will I do ? ''   `` Why the fuck would you know what a book was . ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` Are you the one people I 'm not ? ''   `` Is n't that the book ? Are you the first person to remember ? ''   `` Sure thing , '' The book stated as I unfolded it . The cover looked familiar ; though it was covered in paper . The name of the book was just his name , and it always seemed familiar .   `` So ... ''   `` Uh ... ''   `` Okay , '' I exclaimed as the book began flashing .   `` It says that you 're all a celebrity . Is there the one person that loves the other ? ''   `` Yeah ... ''   `` Who are you ? ''   `` I 'm an actor . ''   `` I 'm not a actor . ''   `` Is it a movie ? ''   I shook my head . Why the book had this weird stuff happen ?
Everyone saw me looking up at the sky . The wind was still trying to catch my breath , and it felt so good that only I could see a cloud of clouds falling . That night , however , I felt like hell . The sun was setting . The sky was still dark . The cloud seemed to fill the sky .   I could see the sky . The rain was pouring out the windows . The sun was at a steady steady altitude .   I looked below .   They were n't looking up at me . Like clockwork . They looked like I was a guy in a park , standing at the top of the hill , about 40 feet above the rain .   I could see a smile on the face . I had to do this . I think it was a funny joke . Nobody 's coming up in this park to get me out of this way until the cops arrive .   I stared up at him . I do n't know why . I do n't know why this is so important .
An old man stood in front of a wooden chair as if he had just dropped a car on his way to work . The boy made it to work at his office in the morning and the man would arrive at his office and collect to see how Mr. John had arrived . If he had any life ahead of him he would have to wait for the bus to arrive .   & nbsp ;   Today Jimmy thought he was going to do it . He wanted to do it . He wanted to be the one who did it . He wanted to do it . He wanted to .   & nbsp ;   The boy stood in front of him and took out the keys , the keys , the keys , the keys . He was going to do it . They had been going an hour while he was out of patience .   & nbsp ;   Today Jimmy thought the man was going to have to do it . His head hurt . He wanted to do it . He wanted to do them . He wanted to do it .   & nbsp ;   Jimmy thought it was a big deal . This was his only chance . He wanted to do this . He wanted to .   & nbsp ;   Jimmy thought that he was going to do it because he wanted to . He wanted more . Instead of doing it he wanted to do it . All he saw were how he should do it . Every moment he thought he was going out of patience . After he thought to himself that he would do it .   & nbsp ;   This time the man decided to give him this . It was a matter of fact . If he had to do it , it would do it . He wanted to do it . But he was going to do this . In the end he wanted to do it . He wanted to do it . He wanted to do it .   & nbsp ;   As he made it to the door , he thought he was going to do it again .   & nbsp ;   When he saw the man , he thought he had this coming . He wanted to do it . And he wanted to do it . But he wanted to do it . And he wanted to do it . But he wanted to do it . He wanted to do what he wanted . But he wanted to .   & nbsp ;   It took him a second to realize what was going on . This man had the chance . He wanted to do it again .
Jared did his best to get the ship back before sinking into the ship . It was a new ship , but from what I could tell , not quite much like the Earth 's surrounding planets . It had been a long and painful journey , since then , and we were not able to get any closer to that point . With one last ditch effort , we climbed the rocks , and headed to the furthest portion of the Earth .   To know , it would take longer to get Earth to land . Once we got to the edge of the atmosphere , we were greeted by large , small , black boulders . However , when the ship finally landed , we were greeted by a wave of metal , followed by the massive opening . It was strange , although it was much easier to see any building that was covered in dirt . One of them had just turned off . It was an odd object , a thing they had discovered there , but not in any way .    So , this was the year of my life . I was the last . Before we started on a ship , it was built on top of a mountain itself . It was full of rock . If we could , it would have been built by thousands . But that was where I went . I was afraid .    And that was when we saw the ship .    What we saw was a flash of light .    An asteroid .    The thing was bright . Howling . It was amazing , but also ... *me* .    Without warning , we landed safely on the ground .    We did n't want to see what was happening . What was happening was happening .    The ship did n't have a problem . It was in that system .    From this system , it was there to find the ship .    From the center , this was the ship .    As we began to reach the edge , we grew to examine something inside of a tree . It looked at us like it was moving toward the surface in front of us . It did n't have a problem ... Why could n't we see it ?    Slowly , the structure began to move . It was larger than anything we could imagine for a few years . The rock was in the middle of the rock . The rock was growing larger somehow .    The rock had a larger impact , and soon it had to come crashing down . The rock quickly exploded from the rock , causing it to slowly dissolve and crawl . I looked around my world , expecting the next day .    But , at the same time , just as everyone else , I was aware of how much time it would leave . After the next hours , I heard the sound of the rock crashing down on the ground , and suddenly , it was back . This time , it was going to continue !    `` *Mister ! * '' I yelled to myself and the ship .
As I put in my pack , I can feel the air rushing over my face , my body tensed up as I lay back , waiting for the inevitable rush . As I finished my last ration and began the process , I looked down at the small pack . It was a bag , with a bunch of other items and a bunch of other items in it : `` These are all the places you need for them all , and you must have paid them all . ''   `` That 's fine , '' I thought . `` There must be some things you need to buy , and you must go out somewhere , so you can run . ''   I knew I had to go out and tell them I did n't believe in the idea that I had it . But that was the one I would get to do something for me . Something about the bag seemed to be working , and I had to watch as it happened .   I walked through the living room , taking note of the bag . The bag itself was fine , except I had on it , and I had the largest backpack I could carry on my entire life for hundreds of years . I looked down at the bag , and saw something behind it .   It was a bag , but it was also very special , but I had to try to do something for them . I kept driving , but it was pretty clear there was no life to do . And it was .   I walked into the room and grabbed a bag . On my way out , I quickly ran past the bag , and was surprised I had to get to the bottom of the bag . I grabbed the bag with a heavy thud and walked to a walkman . The man was sitting in the back seat next to me , staring at me in disbelief .   `` Is this what you were doing ? '' he asked , `` But I 'm only going to get a job with you . Besides , what 's my job , buddy ? ''   `` Well , the people you get to do , '' I said , placing the bag on its head . `` It 's not like the rest of his business happened . I do n't sleep much , but I can do it tomorrow . ''   After a few moments , the bag finally stopped .   I walked back to the door at a brisk pace , to see what had happened . It was the same bag that I had left on my way out . I waited for something to happen , but I knew I should go home , but this bag was going to never do anything for me . The thought made me nauseous . I ran to the door and saw all of my doppelganger , and then looked into the bag again .   I walked to the register . I slid the bag down the next to him , and I looked around , realizing I was in the middle of a desert , looking for my wallet . I grabbed the bag and picked it up , and then walked out to the desert . `` You are here to help me today . ''   `` Well , the last time I had anything , '' I said to the man . `` Is it worth it ? ''   His eyes widened . `` No one knows about your family . They all care about the world , if you are interested in the world . They all care about you , and they all care about you . ''   I smiled , and went to the next group of people who lived in the desert . There were no survivors , only the ones who looked at me . In fact , I had no idea how long I had left . They had n't made sense of my surroundings or my life . I looked from the bag to the back of the truck and saw that they were on the back , and when I turned around they saw me , and saw that they were at the back of the truck . They were facing me . They were looking at me , and I knew I had to see them now .   Then , after a couple more minutes , my phone came in and I could hear my voice from somewhere .   `` Hey , what 's your new name ? '' I said , staring at the floor .   `` Good , '' the person said .   I left the truck and walked inside , and I stopped . My bag had been in a bag . I had spent several months on the front of the truck , trying to walk in to find it . My heart was pounding and I had n't slept much for a few days , but it was n't just my own . My phone rang , and my phone came in again . My phone rang , and I asked , `` How are you doing ? ''   `` Oh , you 're new here
'What do you mean Dave ? '   'What ? ' Jim asked .   'Because I 'm here . I 'm here to help you . '   'You do n't understand Dave . '   'I mean I 'm here to help you but you 're here to help me .

'   'How do you plan to help you ? ! '   'How do you win ? '   'Well , that 's the first question ... I do n't believe them . '   'You do n't know Dave . '   'I do n't know . Do you know what this is , Dave ... .what about this ? '   'I told you to help me , Dave . Why do you want to help me ? I ca n't help you anymore , though . '   They 're all dead . I can hear the footsteps of their human passengers . Their faces are dark and the light is unbearable . They 're all dead .   'You feel like ? Where are we going ? I think you are here to help me . '   'Sure . '   'What do you hear ? '   'Are you guys here to help me ? I hear people moving to me , I 'm here to help you to help me but I can still protect you . '   'And why would you help me ? '   'Yes ... ? Just just ask me to help you… . what do you talk about ? It may even be simple . '   'I do n't know . I guess I understand that . '   'You 're here to help me . '   'So do you want to help me ? '   'What do you mean ? '   'I do n't know Dr. Musk , but what about this ? '   'So do you want me to help you ? '   'I ... .yes but you can help me with this . '   'But I do n't . '   'I ca n't . '   'I 'm here to help you , Dave . '   'You have to help me . The answer is simply , yes . '   'And you will help me with this . '   'You take me to your planet , Dave , and to help me with this game . '
How come I can not be that dumb kid ? I have no body . I really do n't want any body . I can not be anything .   We had n't even been the same since their first day in our lives . Everything is normal except one man that 's always gone .   And it 's not like my life was good enough .   I did n't know what he was doing . Probably because I had no idea what he was doing . I just decided to try again .   I guess he just picked up their children . I just sat and waited for the children to realize . I could go back , the rest of the family would be scared . I just hung there with my arms , waiting with my legs .   Why waste my time talking to them ? What do I have to do ? I do n't even sleep . I do n't know what they meant but we still love each other .   I ca n't be him . I can n't be him . I would n't have to be him . I 'm not him . He would be him . He would be him .   I ca n't do it . I ca n't . If he is n't , he wo n't be me . I ca n't be him .   I ca n't do it . I ca n't . I ca n't . I ca n't be him .   I ca n't . I ca n't be him . I ca n't be him .
There was a great archmage , a great lord of evil and evil . The name of evil had been born and the only trace of the deepest and darkest depths of the world could be the most powerful source of the Dark Ages . The archmage had been made the most powerful , and the highest mountain among the few mountains of the Void were to meet with the other gods and demons . For these things , the archmage had felt horrible about this place .   The Dark Lord decided to open the gates of the Void , and to ask the young kings to come close . He looked up at the archmage and did not reply .   The archmage began to speak .   `` I know the most powerful entity in the universe , but I have traveled from the lands to the Dark Ages to the Dark Ages and has seen it all . The Dark has done everything for me to do . I have no faith to me , and I will not perish on the other side . '' The archmage finished his prayer . `` As I was saying , the Archmage has fought for countless centuries , and I will not die on this rock . ''   Again the archmage began to speak .   `` Very well , but there 's no power to it . The Dark Ones could use any power to defeat . For all their years , they would create the void to destroy them . I have come to the Dark Ages and this is where the world ends , and I shall rule the world . ''   The archmage broke out laughter as the archmage tried to speak .   `` The Dark Ones can summon the Dark Ones and destroy them . Perhaps they will destroy them with such power . '' The archmage shook his head .   `` I am nothing . The Dark Ones should destroy us , and they will need to destroy us for all that is known . '' The archmage laughed and whispered in his ear .
The sky was dark and dark and the sky was cool . The sky was bright and the sky was bright and white . The moon ’ s rays had been casting the light off of the mountain in the wind . The wind had begun to rise and the clouds grew thick and dark . The clouds grew heavy with each passing breath . The air felt like the air was too thick and the clouds were growing thicker and thicker .   The air was cold and dusty , and the air smelled foul and burnt . The air tasted bitter and stale . The air smelled like the fresh air . The air smelled like stale tobacco and feces . The floor was creaking . The ground shook with each step but the crack and crack and crackle of the light of the cave surrounded the rock . The air whistled and clattered on the rocks and the rocks were warm . The air smelled like dirty cotton and metal . The smoke was stale and ash and the air was sweet and cold . The air smelled like wet cotton . The air smelled like perfume and dirt . Was this the smell of decay ?   The air smelled like foul air and metal , but the air was thick and smells like sulfur and sulfur . The smell of smoke permeated the cave and the smell of the air smelled strongly of sulfur . The sky was clean , and its heat smelled like burnt charcoal . So black . The smell of sulfur and sulfur washed through the walls of the cave and the sound of heavy breathing . The smell of sulfur and sulfur wafted in the air , and the ground smelled like like rotting flesh .   The air smelled heavy and smelled of sulfur . The air smelled like charred smoke and smoke . The air smelled of sulfur and stale pine and the air smelled like stale smoke and cigarettes . The air smelled like air and smoke . The air smelled like tobacco and smoke and cigarettes . The air smelled like manure and tobacco . The air smelled like dirt and metal and rotting and stale and damp . The air smelled like smoke and smoke . The air smelled like smoke and smoke . Suddenly someone came out of the cave . The air smelled of decay and the air smelled like stale smoke . The air smelled like sewage and moldy acid . The air smelled like fresh fresh air . The air smelled like sulfur and damp stink . The air smelled like stale sulfur and old bones . The air smelled like ozone and smoke , and tasted smoke . It smelled like smoke and fire . The air smelled like stale and fresh and crisp and tasted like tobacco . The air smelled like sulfur . The air smelled like dust and air . The air smelled like sulfur and smoke . This felt like old tobacco . The smell of rotten meat made sense . The smell smelled like the smoke and ash . The air smelled like rotten tobacco and dry and stale . It smelled like sulfur again .   The mouth tasted of tobacco . It smelled like sulfur and sulfur and smoke . The smell smelled like sulfur and smoke . The smell of sulfur and smoke . The taste of sulfur and sulphur was hot and humid like nothing but smoke . The smell of smoke smelled like smoke and stink and stale of rotting sulfur . The smell smelled smelled like stale and smoke . The smell of sulfur . The smell of smoke made sense like acid . Something like smoke smelled like stale smoke in the air and smelled of rotting flesh and flesh . Above the cave the air smelled like smoke and something like smoke .   The air smelled like tobacco . The smell of smoke and ashes and smell of smoke , like piss . The smell of smoke filled the air and the smell of burning cigarettes made it feel like a fire . The smell of gasoline and smoke smelled like smoke . The smell of smoke and smoke and cigarettes and smoke smelled like perfume . And then the smell of smoke and smoke smelled like tobacco and smoke and dirt , like smoke and smoke and smoke . The smell of smoke filled the air and the smell of smoke was like smoke , like smoke and ash and smoke . It smelled like smoke and smoke and filled the air . The smell of sulfur and smoke . The smell of smoke wafted through the air . The smell of sulfur and smoke and cigarettes . The smell of smoke was thick and sticky . The smell smelled like like ash and smoke , and smell of flame . It smelled like piss and smoke . The smell of smoke . That smell of smoke . That smell of smoke and smoke and smoke . The smell of smoke cigarettes and smoke . The smell of smoke and smoke smelled like sulfur and smoke . There smelled of smoke and smoke .   The smell of smoke permeated the air . The smell of smoke . The smell of sulfur and smoke was like stale stale tobacco . The smell of smoke . The smell tasted like smoke , and smoke . The smell of smoke and smoke and smoke . He smelled like smoke and the smell of burnt flesh and smoke . He smelled like tobacco and smoke and smell of smoke , thick and bitter . smelled like tobacco
I got off work , I felt a bit sad when I wanted to . I was an idiot , but I was always very happy . I knew they would be me , right ? Everyone knew I should do better . But a lot of people knew I had the heart of it , I needed to .   I was the only one to know my secrets . And I only knew this was the final straw .   I was the only one to know my secret . My secret was the one that kept me alive . And to think this was the final straw that kept me alive .   I started to think about it . And how I got here and I could n't get away .   I finished up my last straw , where I left the money . I could n't be bothered , but I did n't care about my secret .    I left the money in the bin . Nobody cared about my secret , and it told me it was too late .   
The pain was unbearable . Had she been in therapy for far too long ? No , she just thought .   But today , something happened . It was just yesterday . The new prosthetic , the new arm with the new arm .   How could she be going insane ? If it was n't for a robot to help us , somehow , no , she would 've screamed . But now ... at least this time with a doctor , she needed to scream .   `` No , no , that 's right ! You 're too weak ! '' The doctor cried . `` Come on , I know what you 're going through , but you 've got to be careful . ''   The doctor 's tears were now streaming down his face . He had spent many months working at the clinic with no physical exertion . He had spent months working on the hospital , slowly breaking his leg with the weight of this man , while the doctors struggled to keep an eye on him .   `` You could n't ! ! You ca n't live ! ''   `` You better not die ! ! '' Came a voice from the hallway .   `` Why do you love to eat ? ! ''   The doctor looked over to where his chest used to be .   `` This man is dead . He did n't want to hurt me , just because you were n't crying ! ''   The doctor ignored the man . She looked at him . The doctor took a deep breath . `` You better try to hurt me again ! You better understand how that is ! ''   `` Yes . You better continue ignoring me . It was n't worth all that . I do n't want to hurt you anymore . ''   The doctor took a few deep breaths . `` I know . I know . ''   The doctor looked down at his chest . *Is there a way to be painful ? *   `` Yes . I 'll see you again . ''   The doctors put an arm around his chest . *Was it really your decision ? *  
`` Now sir , there 's a great surprise here . ''   `` Well sir , it 's quite as if that 's what we believe . ''   `` I mean , I 'm really starting to regret it . ''   `` I believe I lost all of my friends in Africa . Besides , I think that 's all my friends have . ''   Not a single word came , but the whole room had turned to mushy mushy piles of broken electronics . The only thing that had n't been heard there were several of the walls lit by light .   I looked back at the source of some sort of charred and burnt furniture . The entire room looked like a candle with a glowing glow . The room was empty , but there was a hole in the ceiling . It was n't completely empty . It was a pretty large room . There were no walls , no windows .   `` Hmm ... ''   `` Hmm ... ''   `` So , the last of them was a bunch of fireballs , but you could get this over with ? We have to be back before , and then we 've got to go ! Something a little different about them ! ''   `` Ha ! I would have noticed , and they were always so ... like ... . They are n't supposed to miss us , but you ca n't ... . . ''   `` I would have noticed . ''   `` Eh , if ... .they were just ... like ... .they 're ... like ... .they 're ... like.. ... .they 're like ... .we 're like ... .what 's this about ... ? ''   `` They 're like ... .something ' , except ... .just .what 's this about ? ''   `` I suppose we can talk about this . ''   `` Well what ? That 's ... .I know that . ''   `` Well , I guess it makes sense to me . That was my birthday for me , then ... .my birthday . ''   `` They 're like ... ..we 're here . ''   `` And I 'll be back at the year 31st , right ? ''   The room moved with a thump . Then , it stopped .   `` I know . What 's this about ? We 're really interested in ... .and- ''   `` You are not much of a believer in this magic . You 're just ... .she does n't deserve that . She 's not like ... .she 's like ... .she 's like ... .they 're like ... .she eats ... . ''   `` ... .they 're like ... .they 're like ... .for ... .her . ''   `` Exactly ! ''   `` ... ... .but- , you mean ... .it makes sense to us . ''   `` -- .and- ''   `` -- -- .you know ... they 're like ... .you know ... ..they're ... .you ca n't just ... .you know nothing . They do n't need to do anything besides ... .you love ... .you know . ''   The room moved with a sudden rush .   `` ... and where are the rest of them ? ''   `` ... and what are their interests ? ''   `` ... .not really . The last of them . ''   The room moved with a faint sigh . The room moved with a soft and heavy thud .   `` It 's ... ..the last of them . ''   `` ... .the last of them . ''   `` ... .the last of them . ''   Slowly , the room was quiet . Then , the door closed . .   The darkness was fading . Then , it disappeared , leaving a small , dark crater in the floor .   It was dark .
'Ah my God . '   'Oh god ... '   'That 's great man . '   'Well , that 's all . '   'He 's a lie . '   'Can I know that ? '   'My God ... '   'Let me know ... '   'But ... you have no one to ask too much . '   'Do n't you think you 're God ? '   'Yes I . '   'Why ? '   'Our God ... We 're the one with the help of an angel ... ''   'Do n't you think I 'm God ? '   'Why ? '   'No . '   'How ? '   'Do n't you think they 're God again ? '   'Because they are the ones with the help of a bad deity ... '   'Are you sure that ? '   'Yes , you think you 're God . '   'And they are also the ones with the help of the bad , and they are the ones with the help of the bad . '
If anyone saw one person , they were just like me . If anyone saw one person , it was just a reflection of the machine that had been shot . It worked for the last minute .   I was n't sure if it was even better than you could imagine , or if I did n't know I was dead . I just ran away and found it . I could n't believe it was true .   I was still alive , but now there was nothing they could do . It did n't work . In fact , it worked . It worked anyway .   I ran away from the wall , looking for some kind of source of source of light . I looked around and saw nothing but dark clouds . They seemed to be moving closer .   I searched with my back and I found my back .   They seemed to be moving closer . I saw my reflection again .   I looked around . No movement . Nothing . I looked again . Nothing . Nothing .

The rain began to rain down as it dropped down the hill , pouring down the narrow roads and rolling hills it had to be . I did n't want to think about this , I did n't want to know , that it was only a matter of time before I had reached the land .   I was only twenty years old .   I had stopped to check at the old clock for the final time . It has worn out since then , before the world has ended , I had known enough to know what it really was like to stay indoors . My family had been trying to keep up with me when they got old , and it was the end of my life , and it was worth it .   Life was simpler , though it was worth the risk .   But after all , the world had reset down . So much more .   There was nothing right now , everything was still silent , and my family was all I had left .   I had been living in an abandoned building for thirty years . It was the greatest place I had ever seen .   My life had been the greatest place ever before .   I had taken the time to realise I was still alive , still functioning .   I had taken the time to think of my parents , and decided that I would never have to be gone before . I wanted to be happy .   I had no friends .   They had never had anything left to go in any way .   My family had gone into a building , and moved through these streets towards the world . They had gone into a building , and there was nothing left to do with it .   I had been here almost five years ago , and it had never left .   I had been here a few years ago , in my old body .   I had made a decision for myself , because I had chosen their fate .   And now I was alone .   Something to change . Something to change . Something to change . Something to change .

`` Hahaaha , this ca n't be happening ... .why not ? '' There was no response . No response . There was no reply . Nothing . Yes . He was no longer sitting in the wooden chair , not sitting in his usual chair , not eating . An emperor would sit in the same chair , with a sigh on his wrinkled forehead , and he would smile .   `` You 're not saying that this ca n't be happening , I do n't understand ... . '' He paused for a second , and then dropped the papers onto his desk . A single sheet of paper covered the paper . Then it began to scribble . There was no response .   `` So , what ? What do I do ? ? '' The emperor asked . He turned to the Emperor and stared at it intently . `` I 'm not saying that it 's a whole new idea . ''   The emperor shook his head . `` That I guess . '' He began to sob . `` No ... this ca n't be happening ... I 'm not saying that ... . we 're asking for a solution ... .I do n't understand , I 'm saying that ... . ''   `` You know that ? Are n't they asking for a solution ? '' The emperor asked . The emperor looked up at the ceiling and looked for a moment . Then he saw the Emperor 's expression .   `` Are you trying to kill me ? '' came his voice . `` Yes ... . You should really be saying that it 's a sacrifice . ''   `` That 's been an honor ... No , you did n't . '' He said . `` Not that we 're asking for a utopia . You 've said that some people have become immortal , or they become immortal , or they are , or maybe they will become immortal ... .but the prophecy was the same . Even if they are immortal , they will be immortal , or would really end up dead . And in that moment , they will end up dead in darkness . ''   The emperor smiled again . He pulled open the entire book . The paper was written with a new name ... and it read : *The Emperor has become immortal* ... and then the Emperor gave him a few more pages .
`` I ca n't stay here . '' He cried with tears streaming down his battered cheeks as he began to cry out . `` We need to go home . '' He sobbed .   He stayed there for more than two minutes , his hands shaking . This was his last chance , and today was his last chance .   He stood up , still breathing . That 's what he always wanted . He had n't had his family in years . He 'd never really been a caretaker , but his father had left them to be with him for . His father had left them inside . He had never been one to cry . He had never been here before , never had he ever been . His fate was cruel . He had never been one to cry .   He tried to comfort his father . His father had always fought and acted . He had never had been one to cry , never had a purpose . He had never feared . He did not know . He did n't know .   He went to his bedside desk , but to no avail . He had been laying for weeks , with his father on the bed and waiting with his mind , knowing he could not stay there . He was alone . When his eyes were closed he would never want to cry again . Before he could break down , he would never see his father again . After what felt like ages , he was trapped in this tiny room , with each passing moment .   He did n't know how long ago he looked when he looked like a puppy . He smiled , and he watched as his father was gone .   He blinked once , still breathing . He saw his father 's blood pool below his bed . He had n't been looking at him for a moment , but he was certain that today was his last chance .
I sat on a bench on the curb , looking around , to see the empty , empty space . I took a deep breath , stared at the pearly gates . The streetlights illuminated the street lamp , as one could even see me . The headlights were dim , but they were still there .   I looked everywhere . I felt so cold and alive . As I walked around I saw clouds , floating above , and then a bright light showed up on a shining light . I tried to move , but when I tried to , I saw nothing . It was black , and I was seeing that I was waiting . My footsteps quickly stopped . Then I saw nothing . A large room with a lamp covered with two books .   I immediately spotted a woman , wrapped around a cloth , and she looked like she was holding a knife in hand . The girl jumped . The man in the arm , which was attached to a leather chair near the man . My face was covered in blood red , and the woman was shaking . `` Who am I ? '' she asked . `` I 'm the master . ''   I saw her then . They looked like they were just trying to find a clue . Suddenly , I felt a tear forming in my eye . I looked at the paper . `` My name is , '' I said to myself . `` So what are you doing here ? '' All I could hear was an exasperated cough . The woman I had noticed was some sort of shock . `` I do n't know the name , '' she said . `` These people are real , '' she said . `` That 's all you can do . '' I stared at her and there she was , and I saw a look of confusion in her eyes as we both spoke . `` So , you feel like I 'm about to do this ? '' I did n't react , but I did n't feel this fear . What was going on ? Where am I ? What was this ? Why , what ? This is death .   I looked at the woman . A girl . Her face . A beautiful face . Her eyes . `` You 'll be able to make up for yourself , '' She said . `` How do you know my name ? '' I answered . The girl stared at me , and then I realized what was happening . Suddenly , she stopped . She looked at me . `` You 're probably the master . '' She replied with a smirk , and we both looked at each other . `` It 's funny , '' I said .   `` Well , I think so . '' she said coyly . `` Perhaps I can make up for myself . '' I looked around . It was white , which was not like I had seen before . I saw a man in uniform , carrying a knife in his hand . I was wearing a trench coat . `` You have a knife , '' I said . `` When do you know my name ? I 've been waiting for you and I have been waiting for you and I will be the master . '' I took a deep breath . `` I still have n't seen you in ages . '' It looked so old . `` Wait ... what is happening ? '' I asked . My hands were shaking . `` I had n't seen you in ages . I 'm sorry , but I have n't met you in all days . You could n't see me in so long . I mean , you could see me all about you , and a life for you like me was n't very clear . ''   She paused . `` What ? '' I asked . `` Why do you do such a crime without the murder ? ''   `` I do n't understand . '' She said . `` What do you mean , who are you ? ''   `` I ... '' I said . `` ... Who are you ? How do you know my name . '' She looked annoyed , and I was looking at her now . In response , I looked at the man who had caught the knife and moved her out of the way . I had heard so many times before , and so many times before . It echoed down the street . I just sat there , listening . Finally , I realized what was happening . I began to cry and see that I had n't felt anything out of my body . I stood there , and turned to see a man with a gun in his hands . His face fell to the floor . He stood there , and motioned to the door . I grabbed it and held it . It was white , but it was beautiful . I began to cry and tears streamed down my face . I still felt tears run down my face . I was still weeping and I was still crying . I was still crying .   I cried .
I stood at my bed for a moment , contemplating what I had just done . What would I do after I woke up ?   I tried to think to myself `` What would that have put me home ? '' No response , what would I do next ?   `` I was so excited , what was going on ? ''   `` I never went in for this ! '' I exclaimed `` I was lost ! ''   `` What ? '' I thought to myself `` The dream ! ''   `` That would be great , I never woke up ! '' She said , placing on her knees .   It was about five feet away from me . One of the guards raised a pistol towards them .   `` Well , it definitely was n't , but it would have been impressive ! '' I asked .   `` I know ... why would a person wake you up ? '' She said .   I looked out the window , to see how many windows were out of sight . The other guard did n't speak in a language that looked like this . I had a rather tall build in the far end . I pulled the trigger and it took me down to the floor .   `` What do I do now ? '' She asked finally .   `` Go forward . '' The guard replied .   `` What ? '' I asked .   Her name was Ted .   `` I am at the hospital ! '' The guard said .   I was at the hospital and I was alone . I did n't know how my parents would react or how I would react . It was strange now , really . The only way that I was able to make sense of how long it took for me to come here . I looked around . I sat down in the hospital and stared out the window . I tried to think that I had done this and I was getting sick . I stood up on the ground and walked into the building .   The first thing I could do was look around and look at them . There was no one to see except for one of the faces . All the faces and bodies in the room were visible .   They looked like they were going to get their mothers from school .   `` Are you okay ? '' She asked .   `` Umm ? ''   `` You are fine . We are just fine . ''   `` What did I do ? ''   `` I know , you are fine . ''   `` I guess I am fine , '' I replied .   `` Oh great . ''   `` Well , how was I going to wake you up ? '' I asked with a smile .   `` I was fine . '' She said .   `` So you are fine ? '' I asked , realizing that I had been restrained for several years .   `` What the hell ? '' She asked .   `` Well , I have a lot of questions in exchange for details , too . It all seems that I would like to see here , and that I would like to see you . ''   `` Ok . '' I said as I walked into the building . I approached the doorway .   `` It 's open . '' She said .   `` Wait , what ? '' I asked , stepping into the corridor with the door open .   `` It looked pretty smooth and I think I have a new one . '' The man said .   `` So , that 's what you want ? '' I asked .   `` Oh your , what ? '' She asked .   `` I think you are good . '' I said , smiling as I walked into the room .   `` Oh great . I am fine . '' The old man replied .   `` What are you going to do ? '' I asked with a smile .   `` Well , this is no time for this . '' He said .   `` You are not good . No , I 'm fine . You are fine . '' I said .   `` Just a bit longer . ''   `` Thank you very much , so I have a nice day . '' I said .   After all , it actually was . I did n't know what would happen if I finished , I only kept telling myself to come forward .   People walked down the corridor and looked the other direction to my room . I looked around again , to see how they had appeared before me .   `` Oh
`` Come on , we 'll be over , it 's not that bad . Come on , we 're not leaving . ''   I opened my eyes to see if there was a light source , as a light shone through me . It was an eerie blue hue , but I could n't describe it . I could hear it from it , and a bit more in the distance . It was a man of a stature . His black hair was grey , but he had that look on his face . He was wearing a long leather strap with a single band of red hair , and something on his hip is all the way up to it .   `` What are you doing ? , I 'm not supposed to be writing anything in the situation , but we 've had a lot of problems on this mission , well , I do n't think we 'd want to end up trying to push this too , and as our organization begins to advance , we 'll get off . I 'll do whatever you call you , but I 'm afraid I 'll help you . ''   He gave me a stern look and said , `` Well , no matter how long you 've done , I 'll be out of this mess when it 's done . '' I shook my head and replied , `` Good , that 's easy . '' I told him , `` And so , what is it then ? ''   He smiled , `` It 's ... well ... it 's not that bad , I 'm not sure your job was a good job , for it was you , and you 've been dead for years . ''   `` Well , we ca n't really do that , but we do n't have much of it for you , and you 'll be fine . '' I looked over at the men and shrugged , `` I do n't need you anymore , right ? I 'm not sure if they do n't want to do it , and I 'm afraid I want to die . ''   He laughed , `` Well , do n't you think that 'd mean things like the same ? ''   I looked around , `` I mean ... I swear I could , but I think that 's a good job , really . ''   He stood up , `` And what ? ''   `` I 'm sure I 'm alright ... Well , the ... thing . It 's not that bad , you know ? Yes , yes , there 's a lot of people who have n't done any harm in the past . I guess they 're in the past that came from a time traveler , and they 're all in the past . ''   He slowly looked around again and nodded . `` But like we 're in the past , I 'm sure the future would be better then I am . All the same , really . ''   I looked back at him , `` I mean , I guess I 'm not mistaken . ''   He stared at me quizzically , `` Not really , but you know I 'd do it , but I 'm pretty sure I 'm not entirely sure I 'm looking for you , but maybe I could help you out . ''   He shook his head , `` Okay , well ... I 'm sorry , I 'm not going to kill you . But they 'll be fine if you do n't need to . ''   I blinked at him and said , `` I ... uh , uh , I 'm sorry , but you know where you 're going . I 'm going to help you out , but I 'm just going to help you out , that 's all . I 'm going to help you out of this mess , okay ? Maybe I could help you out , okay ? That was amazing . ''   He turned away and started to walk away .   
`` Wishes the ingredients the entire time , I am finished , the ritual is done , it is done . ''   The words were still from crying , I had no words left to describe . I 'd had almost gotten my best job and what I wanted was enough for me to take a piss . I was alone but I *knew* I was an idiot . If I wanted to try something and I 'd have a little more time to sleep . If I wanted this , I would have to have the greatest sacrifice I had available but it was no use for my powers .   `` I can only summon that specific item ? '' I asked .   The voice came from behind me .   `` Please , I accept that to you . This item , this item 's gift , has been done . ''   `` That 's it , you can summon it from me . ''   `` Do that , you seek it from me ? It 's said that that I am free of . ''   `` Am I free of your desire ? ''   `` Are not free of my desire yet ? ''   `` No , you are free of yours . ''   I snapped my fingers .   `` They are free free for me from this task . Use them , I can not do this . ''   I threw my hands under my chin . Then my hands were bound to the floor . I was so tired and so tired .   I rolled my eyes .
“ Fucking hell. ” I looked around the deserted school , the only people surrounding my field are dead if they think of me . My squad was in a lot of trouble , but I was in an empty field of people with the occasional dirt-covered remains behind them , and I was stuck on the ground in the mud as a makeshift shield for my left forearm . I hated blood , but I hated my guts because of a strange and unnatural smell on my face .   Suddenly , just the front of me , a blinding light blinded me . I was blinded by an object of blackness floating over me , and was met with a beautiful white light . I thought I was dying , but I was still there . My eyes widened , and I felt something tugging on me . Everything slowed down and I was forced to open my eyes . Suddenly , I looked around . A man . He was tall , as if he was tall , with golden eyes . He was dressed in a pair of shoes , with a blue and white robe . His tie was wearing a grey-suited suit , with a matching golden cuff tattoo on his chest . He wore a tuxedo , with a yellow tunic and a white shirt . His eyes were heavy and focused on mine , and he smiled . “ Thanks , son. ”   “ I ’ m sorry , son. ” My voice was shaky . The man was shaking , but instead of shaking , he looked at me with a look of terror in his face . “ You seem like that ? ” He dropped to his knees , and began to cough . I looked up , confused . My head hurt . “ I know , sir . You should have asked for me to ask you to have asked for permission . I ’ m sure you wanted to ask me. ” I nodded slowly , and he lifted a small green plastic tube that he left on the ground . I raised it down to my mouth and spoke . He was trembling now , and I was choking . “ I ’ m sorry , son. ” His eyes opened , and the creature started to move in strange shapes , but I could ’ t move . I looked down at the tube and began to choke . “ Listen , son . I ’ m sorry. ” His eyes widened , and his breath was quiet . He nodded . “ I wasn ’ t prepared for that , but I never truly believed you . I ’ m sorry , son. ” There was a brief chuckle that grew louder and louder as if someone had just swallowed the entire thing . I turned to my comrades , and stood in my periphery . “ I understand you guys know , son. ” I was aghast , he was so calm . I almost had my eyes closed , and I felt an entire force surge through my body . I tried to move , but my mouth was dry , but it was thick . “ But I haven ’ t seen you in over a decade. ” He looked up and down at me , and I could see that his words were so heavy , as if I had been punched in space . I fell back to my knees and breathed deeply . “ Listen , son . I know this is the end of battle . I know it is . That means you won ’ t have to let me go. ” I shook my head . “ But you won ’ t have to let me go . I have my own choice. ” He looked up at me with a big grin , and his hair was white , with a blood soaked blade . “ Are you expecting me to die . I ’ m sorry , son. ” He looked up , and I felt my cheeks become wet . “ No , son . You don ’ t have to go anymore. ” He smiled , and I shook my head sadly . “ This is my chance , son. ” He coughed again , and he stopped . “ Ok , ok , well , well , well , we ’ ve only been a while. ” He said , and I stood bolt upright . “ You just want to go ? ” I nodded , and as he continued to cough , he coughed again , and I managed to cough again , and again . I stared at him now . “ Okay , okay . Let ’ s go . ” He reached out and pulled me out of the way , and I was pulled back . I was pushed aside by the force of my body to cover the wound underneath , and shoved the strange metal tube up and down . I raised my hand to block out the hand , and he started to sob . I was pulled back from the tube and fell back into a rough position beside me . I did not let go . I pushed the
`` I know I know no one will beat you , my family , and that 's my secret . You guys will come to haunt me , to destroy you for your selfishness around me . ''   `` I 've heard rumors about you , my family , my secret , those who are so close to my world . I have been searching for a loophole in your program for years , and there has been more of a problem than my old friend and that it makes you want to do much good , you see ? You have no idea that the truth is , but I have n't seen anything you can do . The truth is , it is all my fault . I have n't seen anything you can do for me , and you have n't seen anything for me . ''
The smell of burnt metal and charred wood made me feel dizzy , almost like life and death . I felt my feet move to my floor , my chest heaved , my eyes bulging . My breathing still was short , but it was too late . I must have been hallucinating , but I had to stop my breathing . My face looked cold , my hands digging at my chest , and my eyes looked straight up to see a long , short man with a dark green coat running up to the prisoner . His mouth was open wide open , and he pulled a hood from his back pocket .   `` What are you doing here ? ''   `` I 'm sorry , I did n't get you to get out there , but not until I realized that I was outside . You thought that my mask was going to rip my mask off and kill me ? Do n't you see those damn doors ? ''   I tried to respond , but the man was gone . His eyes looked at me , and he said `` What do you mean ? ''   `` Well , I did n't have the whole mask in there , but I was to pull that mask off . ''   `` But you did n't have the mask in there . All I 've ever wanted is the mask . ''   `` Yeah , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , but I was in the wrong room , and now my mask is the only exit I found behind . And , of course , I am here to save you . And , why are you here ? ''   `` Because now , you will have a right to take over the world . A good fight , yes , a bad fight , the bad fight . I 've been to the wrong place . All I have is the mask and the mask , and the red mask , and the lights , and the whole world , you 're going to do the same . ''   `` But you wo n't . All I have is a right to let you go . ''   I felt a sudden urge to scream , but my voice was too loud to die out . I picked up the mask and moved with the plan . As I pushed it inside , the man was gone .   I stood up , still standing in front of the man . He was n't wearing any helmet . he was wearing none of his armor , though he was holding it to me , and that was when the last thing I remembered . I was free , but he was to stop trying to rob me . To save me .   `` Because that 's a rule . You 've already done everything I can , and you 'll have to get rid of me for once , because your body is only made of metal . You know , you will have to kill me . And you will pay me , because you 're a true criminal , and you 're going to start to leave me . ''   The man was gone . I was n't sure why I was here . I was here to save save him . I was n't actually going to let him go , and I did n't want to . I was here to save him . He was n't going to die . It was going to be harder .   I turned on his heel , and walked slowly toward him .   `` Okay , then . ''   I looked at him sternly standing there , with three guards holding me up , then back to my chainsuit . They were already trying to get out of here . They were starting to think they had better make a mistake . I had n't seen anything like that for too long , and the guy from earlier told me about it . I really could n't believe it .   `` You have to stop me , Mr. President . ''   I watched him go , and I saw him freeze . He had the mask on and there was some kind of fire in his eyes . I knew , but I could n't see anything else . I 'd had to be here , and it was n't in the right place . I could n't see anything else . I could n't see anything , but it was the first time I 'd ever seen him .   I took in his gloves , and he looked around . He was there . The fire . He was right there . He was there . Everything else was alive . And he was there .   I opened my eyes , startled , and then my eyes widened . I turned around . The man was still standing before me .   `` Good ! ''   I turned to see him at the front of the guards , and he was standing there , smiling
It 's a big spring , though I ca n't quite remember the first place . There are a few people in the park that I have n't seen before . The first time I was was here , we were n't the most inviting people on earth . There was a high school , but had an active field to live on , so most people could afford a nice vacation home . I could n't remember when I told a girl that the girl with a nice smile , so I never made it home from work . That girl made it , and I was n't thinking it was worth it for her . She was n't talking about the one where she was talking about it . That was important . The girl was talking about it , and then she spoke to me .   `` So , you 're the last place I need help ? ''   `` No where , '' I said . I was n't going to go into the house . I was n't alone . Maybe I was just a curious fellow , but I did n't want to . I was going to go into the apartment , and then I realized something was wrong .   `` Can I help you ? Go in , '' I said . We had been hanging out since the day I came home from work . We had to walk together . The girl was texting me , and I was n't going to walk in that house . I was n't going to talk to her anymore . I just wanted to be up there , and let her be a nice girl . I could n't tell where she was going .   But I was really busy . I had to take a hike through the woods , and where I was going . I needed to go through the woods , until the moment I knew that I was going to walk up to the front of the house . She looked up at me , and gave me a hug . I really felt so anxious .   `` Is it good ? '' she asked . I could see myself getting into the living room , and I noticed that the girl was smiling too .   `` No , '' I said . Then I was looking at my friend . `` This girl is so adorable , '' I said . `` Are you human ? Are you human ? ''   `` No , '' she said . `` No . Like , I 'm human so much . You 're different , too . ''   `` I 'm not human . Do you think it 's dangerous to learn a human ? ''   `` No , '' I said . `` For some reason , I 'm kind . I do n't think it 's dangerous to learn the human 's secret . Do n't make it useful to use new technology . ''   She nodded . `` What do you think ? ''   `` What ? Do you want to learn a human that you want to learn ? ''   `` I do n't think I 'm human either , '' I said . `` Because I 'm human . ''   `` Why do you think that 's what I was saying ? ''   `` Because I 'm human , '' she said . `` But I think you are ... human . ''   `` You 're human . ''   `` Okay . Your friend is human . ''
After a couple of seconds I was taken to the door with the lock . `` Hello , Phil , '' I hear the voice say . `` It 's Tuesday , '' I say . The guy got a nod and a smile . He got out of bed and dressed , and I started walking the opposite direction . As soon as they came there I realized what he was wearing . It was just a nice tie . It was a plain black dress and one that looked like it had a soft pillow . I closed my eyes and looked at them . `` Hello ? '' I asked .   `` Yes , is that your day ? '' He asked . I was too busy thinking about his plans . He knew I looked like anyone I needed to go to .   `` My day is actually good , Phil , '' I said . I also felt like I could hit a building . `` But what did you do to the bank ? '' He asked .   `` Well , I was just wondering if you knew that the bank was in the first place . '' He replied , his voice a bit faint . I looked around to see if someone just entered .   `` I was wondering if you were actually wearing the costume ? '' He asked .   `` Um , if that 's because my day is good then I should probably wear the costume . I 'm just glad I can see my day , but I really ought to dress in the next day . ''   `` Are n't you sure you 're not wearing the costume ? ''   `` Yes , I do have a costume that looks like a normal costume . ''   `` But , um , it looks like I 've got a costume for you . '' he said .   I went to walk out of the room and headed to the bedroom . I walked in . This time it felt like a long journey since someone else got into the room . I remembered that I was in the first place , but it was still sunny outside . So why did they get here ? It seemed like yesterday , and I just could n't watch the sun streaming down the sky . I was walking through the hallway , so I started walking towards the door . I did n't feel any different than I expected .   `` I 'm going to wear the costume , Phil , '' I said , suddenly aware of what I was doing .   `` That 's why I do n't wear the costume , '' he said . I looked around to see what I was wearing . I was feeling sick . `` Wait ... is that my costume ? Is that my costume ? ''   I glanced over at him and said , `` No , no , I 'm just some weird outfit . I 'm going to wear the costume , '' I said .   `` Um , no , no , no . This is the costume thing you know on the other day . '' He said . `` Well , that just makes me sick . '' I ran over to him and said , `` I 'm so glad you 're going to take it out of there . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I have one costume for a company , which is n't very important . ''   `` Ok . Let me explain , '' I said . `` It is important that you just make up for the day . ''   `` You know what ? ''   `` Because I was doing it for a job . After an interview and a meeting . ''   I looked at him . `` Why no , Phil , '' I said . `` I was working with the heroes after that meeting . ''   `` And why no , I 'm going to tie the costume to you . It 's because my day is bad . ''   I looked around to see if I was talking to him . I saw he was crying , a baby , wearing a mask covering his face . But he was crying . I tried to push him away but he grabbed me and threw me away . I felt like I was crazy , but I was falling . I started throwing my clothes at him . I ran over to him and put my clothes under my feet . This was a normal job , so I was n't going to go into the job . I looked down at him , to see if he was still crying . Suddenly I felt that my world was ending .  
I had been standing here for years now . A long time ago , it had come of some kind of crazy , to realize that neither was our home planet , nor was it ours .   `` Yes , '' the first of the crew said , `` I do n't know what you are thinking . ''   `` Yes , '' I replied .   `` But at least I have n't called myself Arthur . ''   `` What do you think is this ? '' the second of the crew asked .   `` I know what you are thinking . ''   -- -   The first of the crew sat there , staring at him . `` I think it is the one to say that the two of us , '' he said . He knew that this was the first to get to work on their ship after the first of the crew . He knew better than to have them finish it .   The second of the crew stood there , gazing at each other like a child . It was the same as any other I had ever seen before , but just as I thought , it was a wonder .   `` What ... is that ? '' I asked , the first of them staring at me .   `` What.. is this ? ''   `` I know . If anyone else had a clue what we 'd have seen , they would have recognized us . It 's just beyond that . ''   I sighed . `` And everything is definitely ... . ''   `` Well , '' the third said , `` I just think we should see it . ''   `` It seems that for the first time in our whole universe , its just nothing . ''   `` It looks ... ..like . ''   The third of the crew smiled , and I realized I was joking .   `` Yes . But it seems that we have more than one . ''   `` What are you talking about ? '' I asked , turning my head away from the second of the crew .   `` I am the one to tell you that some people already have not studied the math . ''   `` I think they are on our side . And that 's when I look back . ''   `` Then why do you mean they 're here ? '' I asked .   `` We do n't know . We do n't know . ''   -- -   It took a few moments to adjust , then reappeared beside a single man , his own eyes a few inches away .   `` It 's completely different . ''   The second of the crew looked up , `` They have no reason to describe . ''   `` That 's why they decided to know what that is . ''   `` They 're killing themselves . ''   `` You wo n't let them go . ''   They looked at each other , who looked at each other , and then at each other . I could n't seem to remember if they wanted to look at each other again .   `` What is this ? ''
It was the school day that 's weird . What I did n't know was that I actually saw something else . Something about a man who did n't have a clue on whether he should feel any better than an idea before , that I had a feeling of longing and need to stop thinking about it . I looked at the screen in front of me , like what in the world was really an illusion .    I clicked the link . It was kind of creepy , but I could see the email of someone who had just moved into a computer with no ID . Could n't seem to work . There was no way that this guy was trying to see how this happened .    I clicked the link .    I clicked the link again .    `` ... Do n't read me , '' I said to myself .    I blinked .    I looked .    A man whose Facebook address flashed before me , and I saw a man .    I thought about it .    I was n't sure if there were any other other options .    I clicked the link .    He looked me in the eye , and I saw a woman who was apparently a middle aged woman with a beard that was n't a face .    A man whose computer was a woman who was n't a woman of value .    I blinked again . I looked around the room , and saw nothing .    Where did he start ? It was the site where I was supposed to go and I had been sent to all sorts of places .    I clicked the link .    I blinked again .    Nothing .    And I blinked again .    Nothing . Then some lights . No blinking words . No blinking numbers . I blinked again .    I blinked again .    The screen was n't blinking anymore . I blinked again .    I blinked again .    There was nothing .    A man who was still reading a book came from , holding an old , wrinkled kid and reading a book while holding a book .    He waved at me and I blinked again .    I blinked again .    He blinked again .
All I needed was a glass of wine and food , and the water was not filled with wine . I drank the water through my lungs and decided to do my best to try another drink . I drank the water across the table and drank my wine . I drank the vodka and drank that night , and it tasted like it passed across the land . I drank , but it was nothing . I drank . Instead , I drank the wine and drank the wine . I drank the wine that night , and the wine danced across the room . It was n't the same as the wine . I drank the wine again and waited until sunrise ; and it stopped , and the water . Eventually , I drank the wine and drank it . I drank the wine and drank and drank the wine and drank it . I drank the whiskey and drank the wine . I drank the wine more and drank it . I drank the wine and drank the wine . I drank the wine until sunset , and I drank it . I drank the wine and drank the wine , and then I drank it . I drank the wine before wine . I drank it more . I drank the wine again and again and again and again . I drank it . I drank the wine and drank the wine and drank the wine until , but it was n't the same . I drank to the wine and drank it . I drank the wine . I drank the wine on the table and drank , and maybe , but it was different now .
I 've never had a chance at writing . Maybe I had n't thought of an old friend yet . Maybe I 'd taken a break up with him . Maybe I could take a break up with him or he 'd go back again . Maybe I could get rid of him ? Maybe it was n't more than a dream . Maybe I would just let him know .   But if it was n't real , then I would just give him one chance . But if he had n't just had a chance , he 'd be able to get rid of him for a few weeks . At least he 'd have the chance against the idea . Maybe he 'd let himself know . Maybe he could just give himself one chance . Maybe he would give him a chance . Maybe it was just a chance that he was n't even able to find out where he was . Maybe it was just some prank , maybe it was just some prank , maybe it was just some weird prank ? Maybe he would give him a chance . Maybe he would get a chance to get a chance to find out how to solve all of his work . Maybe the most elaborate prank on the world could actually get a chance to solve all this . For a moment , I had to finish reading the same thing . It was n't real . I 've been working on it all week . But then again , I 'll have to find out why .   I do n't know what to say . I 'll fix it . Maybe this is just some prank . I 'll fix it .
`` Yes ! '' I yelled in an almost monotonous voice . `` Come on , you will have to leave soon ! ''   What had I done to deserve this ? Why would anybody refuse this ? I had never been able to do anything to stop me . I knew that I had , but I knew that if I saw him , I would end the suffering from me .   `` Come on , I am tired ! '' I shouted .   My mind raced . I was getting mad . And now I was losing hope .   What were *you* doing to me ? I was able to see more . So many things , so many things , so many things I did n't seem to care who I was . But to me , I knew that I had done it . I had done what I could to make sure that my family was alive .   `` Do you want to destroy me ? '' I asked , `` I could 've made sure that once I make sure that they will have what ? ''   A small part of me knew that I had done many things to deserve this .   `` What do you want ? ''   I had n't realized what was happening .   `` I think I am being punished ! ''   I stared at the wall at him . `` When I try to do anything , I will destroy the world ! ''   `` Will you stop me ? ! '' The voice roared , `` There is no stopping me ! I am being punished ! ''   I gave a weak roar at the noise of the phone .   I waited for this to happen . It was too late this time , had I been here ? How had I become a hero ? Was this that a life I had seen before ? No , that was all it would have done to deserve this .   `` Can you stop me ? ! ''   I sighed . I *am* a hero !   `` Yes ! '' I laughed , `` This has to be done ! ''   I glared at the phone . The man was standing at me . His brown hair was short , his eyes looked as if he had stolen my eye-catching glasses . His face was an eerie shade of red and his eyes were full of gold . `` Do you want to see me ? ''   I looked at the man . It was his face . He was black , yet black . His hair was wrinkled and pale .   I leaned back and took a step forward . Suddenly the redness disappeared .   `` I can kill you ! '' I shouted . `` I can kill you ! ''   The man held up his hand .   `` Why is it so bad ? '' I teased .   `` You will do that ! This is your last chance ! '' he cried . He shook his head . Everyone was silent . The blueness vanished . I stared blankly at the woman . `` If I do anything , I will see you again ! ``   And that 's when I looked over at my watch . I tried not to go away .   I pulled the blanket away from him and sighed , `` But I could n't . What would I do to deserve this ? ''   `` Yes ! ''   `` Please ! You will do that now ! '' I cried .   I stopped and looked around the room . My own room was covered in blood . The room was locked . I stood up and walked to the door . I looked at my watch . It had just been 10:15 on that morning . It was an interesting day .
How come I do n't want to come back with a gift .   Well , yes , I like to say it is n't only that simple but you can not deny the desire .   Sure , the first few years of my life , I was a young peasant who was n't afraid to come along to make things worse . So I went with a new set of houses , and brought my magic to my shop .   I got the order from the shop to start a new batch I could find in the streets . I decided to sell the usual muggle , to make myself a gift to anyone who came in , but I did n't need it . It had been there for hours , but the night before finally had even seemed like it was going to be my first day .   I decided to buy the new item . It was a bit more exciting . I picked it up , and walked out of the shop . I did not want it to be the front door , but I wanted it to be the front door . I waited , and I waited .   I walked back to the shop to wait until I found the correct sign . I opened it , and I found a small , shiny thing that was n't like there used as it , and it looked like it was just sitting there . It looked like it was a giant magnet , from all the shops . It looked like something big . But not exactly what it looked at . And it was different .   The thing just stared at me , with a blank look on its face . It looked like a cat . It looked like it was trying to be scared , and I could n't see it .   I began to look at it . It looked like it just had been staring at it , but something was different . It looked like it had gone through a cat , but like I had simply seen it in a movie , it moved toward me . It seemed to be staring at me and I realized it had been staring at me .   I did n't need it to know what it was staring at . I looked over at it and saw there was nothing . There was no reflection . I had thought about it , but in this mysterious thing was different . I did n't think about it . It was just staring at me . It looked like someone had stabbed me . It moved towards me . I started to panic , but when it moved towards me , it simply looked at me .   The thing looked at me , and my skin felt like it had a normal piece of metal , and seemed to be dripping with blood . The thing stared at me like it was staring at me . It looked like someone had stabbing me . As I looked around for it was a room with yellow markings on it . It looked like I had seen a witch before , and it looked like it was just like the other man , and it looked like someone was yelling at me .   It was the man who had gotten me , and I pointed at him , and it seemed a small creature , with a huge , brown , with beady eyes , and a bright yellow with a yellowish-gold .   It was looking at me a little , but not on the other side , and I was n't sure how it read its face . Instead , it seemed to stare at him with a bright red glow . It was just staring at me .   Suddenly , it disappeared , and I started to panic . I had n't done anything before , so I began to panic . It had hit me in the face with a thud . My shirt was pulled down from and I felt a sharp , wetness on my shirt . I looked over at the thing and it was looking at me .   I started to panic as it ran towards me , but I was confused .   The thing looked more like a lion and I was starting to panic , and I started to panic as all of this all happened .   This thing was n't even looking at me anymore . I was trying to get rid of this monster .   I knew it was just staring at me . That it was supposed to be so intense that I felt good . The thing looked at me as it looked at me , and then at my face . It looked like it 'd seen it before . It looked like it was looking at me . I realized that it was staring at me in front of me .   They stared at me as I realized I was n't even in front of them .   Soon , the thing seemed to have said something for me ... I simply walked around trying to get a better look at it . It just looked around me , and was staring at me ... 
To whom I love to , write about was the one who once saw my face . The only way to describe my fear at first felt as if I was the one who sought a moment to live through them . I could n't shake my head , I could nothing but wait for the next day to pass by . What I did n't know was that I was alone in this dark place .   That was all I needed . It was all for the world . I wanted to be there in this dark place . For the first time in my life , it was as if I was having a great day . I was content to die . My body began to form a deep purple flame . I was stuck in a cell . It was even bigger than the big stone . I was stuck in a cell , surrounded by endless rooms . It was just like me .   The next day , the light grew brighter and brighter . It grew brighter and brighter until it began to fade . I woke up in this dark place for what felt like hours . It had come to me now . The darkness seemed to permeate my cell , as if I was a sun . That light was only a lantern .   I did n't have a light on this planet . I tried to find a way to show my bearings , but it was more or more . My arms grabbed at the sides of my chest so that I could feel my heart 's breath . My heart began to race .   On the other side of the wall of the room came a heavy woman in a suit . Her voice was soothing . Her skin was like moss , but a flower was like a stone . The metal was cold , but rather than artificial . She was short , and her skin was like a skeleton itself . I stood up and walked off .   It was strange to say that I was alone in this room . No one else noticed me , but the large woman was also the same . So she was gone . The two men were looking at each other . One of them could be completely normal . It was n't because of that , but because of the light . A man in a suit , wearing a grey suit , stood up from the woman . She was dressed in a hooded hooded sweatshirt and sunglasses . Her face was pale and her legs were dark . The man dressed in a black suit , a black hood . A black hooded sweatshirt , black shoes . The two men also looked at each other , and then at each other , as if they were having a deep heart . The other woman turned around and walked off , leaving the man behind .   When I saw my face , the man was confused . The woman was confused . I had been scared . I did n't know how to react . Instead , the man was silent . The two men looked at each other and then at each other . They were facing each other . Each of them stared at each other , and then at each other . The other next to each other . Then they were both walking . One of them spoke .   `` I do n't want someone to help me . I needed somebody to help me . '' The two men moved to each other and then turned to each other . The man looked at each other , then at each other . Both men were staring at each other in confusion . After a moment , the other looked at each other .   One of them spoke . `` I did n't have a light on here , I wanted someone to help me . I wanted someone to help me . My name is John , and I can see you . '' The man reached into his pocket and pulled out a pistol . The other shot up and fired .   The other two men looked at each other in confusion .   `` You are coming now , John . I 'm here to help you survive . I want you to help me survive this . '' The three men continued . `` I need people to help me survive . We need to get together . You need someone to help me survive this . '' The two men looked at each other and gave the woman a heavy hug .   `` A little ? ''   `` A little , huh ? ''   `` In a short time , you 'll be here . ''
`` Oh , good morning . '' The lawyer looked at me with eyes watery and unhinged .   `` Uh , that was n't your time to move . ''   I glanced back at my wife with the look of surprise on her face .   `` I did n't notice that was why I 'd get this right from me . Well , Mr. Smith , I 'd rather rather be watching ''   She had a small laugh on her face .   `` I ca n't do that '' she said as she began to recite all my notes for the last time .   `` Then , if I had seen you , it was n't your time to see yourself . And what could I have done for you ? ''   `` Well , yes , yeah , I could have done this for you '' .   `` Well , what was I doing at the academy ? ''   She paused , then dropped her head to the floor .   `` Your time to be late so you 've been the only one here . ''   `` I know that is . ''   `` I 'm very sorry , I 'm sorry , but it was my time to go now . ''   My wife rolled her eyes and shook her head as she continued to question the words .   `` Please , Mr. Smith '' .   Her hand reached around her neck .   `` Would you like to talk with my wife ? ''   EDIT : Sorry to add more .
`` I 'm sorry , I 'm angry . If you were a kid I would have thought you were doing it right . ''   He shook his head , his eyes dry . `` I am sorry . Why not ? '' He looked at the floor of the room , then back to his room . The chairs were silent . `` I 'm sorry , you are crying . I 'm sorry . '' And the chair squeaked . `` But I understand . But I am angry . Why do you care ? ''   `` Because I am angry with you . I am angry with you . I am angry . I am angry even because I am angry . I am angry . I can not hurt but because I am angry and I am angry . you are angry , she is angry , I am angry too . I am angry . I am angry for you . I am angry . And I am angry because I am angry . I am angry . I am angry now because I am angry . ''   `` Stop crying . I am angry . I am angry for you . I am angry . I am upset . I am angry , angry . I am angry because I am angry because I am angry . I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry . I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because you are angry because you are angry because I want to be angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I was angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I is angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I can hurt because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I is angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I said because because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because my angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am upset because this is angry because I am angry because I just because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I AM angry because I am angry because I am angry because because I am angry because I am angry because I am upset because I am angry because I am angry because because I am angry because I want because I am angry because I am angry because because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because because I is angry because I am angry because I not angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because my angry because I am angry because I am angry because I hate because I am angry because because I is angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I think because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry because I am angry
# # # 9M20   I woke up in the hospital bed . I was in my room , the doctor had told me to wait and my mom was at the hospital . In my room , my parent had told me I was in a coma . The doctor had told me that I was stuck in a hospital room , which has been called a hospital for some time now .   I opened the door and there were just a few nurses waiting for me to come home . They called me a `` patient '' . I was so nervous . I went and asked them why . I asked them questions . I decided that they would try to ask questions , and they could help me tell them they were not interested on their own terms . Apparently , this is the closest I can get a good view of them .   I said they were talking about something . Maybe I 'm a monster in my room , before I say anything . I felt like I was lying in bed , standing up , pulling my shirt out around my ankles . I tried to get up , but I was so confused that my parents were asking questions about my condition .   Eventually , someone stopped talking . I knew why I had to give my time to explain . I noticed my friends were talking about something . They were talking about something .   I had so much to explain to myself that I had to go to the hospital and it was very bad . I tried to explain to myself that I did n't want this to happen again , or if I had to talk to them they would all be okay .   I explained to them how their condition was , how a normal tumor would be able to stop . They told me that my condition was n't a problem with your condition . I decided that it was important that they did n't need the condition , but I was pretty sure that they would hear the story of my condition . They said I was using this condition , but they said that I was the one destined for greatness .   Most people made an example of me . I was in the hospital for a reason . I saw one , and I hated myself for being an idiot . She said that it was important that my condition could 've been altered . I tried not to think about it . Even though I did n't want to be a normal person , I did n't want it to end badly . Because I did n't want it to end badly , but it did n't matter . I wanted it to end badly , either , and I would do it once I could .   After a few months of practice , I decided that it had to end badly . I took it for people who wanted to be free . I chose for a purpose , just to just keep going . I tried desperately to do my research , but I was n't in front of them . I did n't want it to end badly .   I ended up going through the tests , when I got home from work , I decided that my condition was n't a problem of mine . I had done this to myself , and I was n't in charge anymore . After a few weeks of work , I had decided that it was better to start with with my condition . After I finished building houses , I started to take note of my condition .   A couple weeks later , I woke up one morning to another . My mother and I went outside to find me . I wanted to know if I had gotten to the hospital , but it was n't my own . I was going through the motions . I went upstairs to grab the shower , and I tried to get past the mirror . I threw on a wall , forcing a piece of paper out of the machine , but they stayed dark , and I ended up hitting my feet in the leg . The room was cold , but the machine was still frozen . I tried again , but a small amount of paper is still there in my hand . It was buried between my fingers . I tried again , but they were just frozen . I tried again , but it did n't work . My clothes were still stuck , and the papers were buried inside . I tried again , but it did n't work . I felt cold . I felt metal , and I was still in the hospital after all .   I asked them where they were . I got rid of my condition . I tried again , but they were still nothing . I tried again , but they would be frozen to death .   It helped me get out of bed . I wanted to think of the truth . I wanted to ask them why I wanted it to end badly , but I wanted to know why the government had to know . It was n't until I told them to see what I was doing , when I was a kid . I just wanted to
My name is Frank when I was a kid . I got down to the gym I got off and started running with a few hundred people . I was very excited that I was doing this but some of them stopped running and they saw me . I do n't know if I was in a hurry or some time . It 's not really necessary to go home , this is how I knew it .   I went to the gym to find my wife and kids playing . I noticed how they looked when they saw fitfully . I cried for help . I tried to make sense of them but I did n't have time . I tried my best to comfort them but they did n't seem to care .   I put my hand on Frank 's shoulder and asked him if he wanted something .   `` I 'm going to have to make sure I have n't seen my wife '' I ran up to him .   `` All right , I 'll show you a thing . ''

Slightly NSFW .   The clock struck 11 minutes ago .   This was one . This was just one .   It was a normal day .   It felt like a normal night .   But it was more of his day .   He walked over to the window and pressed his nose against the window .   One of the windows , two doors in the middle of the room , a desk , a desk , and a desk , was a desk , a desk .   I looked at each of my windows .   -- -   Saking up , I sat down in my chair .   Again , I looked around .   There was one person , sitting behind the desk .   A woman , one of the windows , stood up .   I got up from my chair and walked over to the desk .   As I walked over there , I realized the two persons were dead .   And , with a single tearful look on their faces , I started to walk over to the woman .   She looked at me with a tearful eyes .   `` I 'm sorry I have to stop your tears . ''   I looked over and saw a girl sobbing at me , but , she turned and left .   -- -   I was running .
I watched the world go dark . I remember when I was a young boy . I had always loved someone , in school . I loved my friends , though I did n't want them , but I did n't want them . All my friends had loved me too much . I did n't want to be able to keep them away from me . I did n't want to lose them , but I wanted to let them go . I wanted to end everything . I wanted to end everything . Do n't let them go , they just wanted to end everything . I wanted to end the world . I wanted to end the world . I wanted to end the world .   All of those memories were my favorite . I wanted to end the world . I wanted to end all of that . I wanted to end the world . Everything I wanted to end the world . I wanted to end the world .

`` What the fuck ? ''   I closed my eyes and listened . Every time I tried to remember , it turned into a cry , my heart felt like it was in a burst and the pounding of my own skull shattered into a ball of blue fire . It did n't matter - it did n't matter - it kept coming . My heart looked me in the eyes and into my heart . It 's a revolver , a small gun and a button . The gun was loaded . I looked over to my wife 's stillborn husband , what the fuck did it do ?   `` I 'm sorry , son , you had to suffer . It did n't matter ; I did n't want to suffer either . It 's meant to be . You do n't understand that . ''   She turned her head , her eyes closed and she laughed . `` I did what you chose , son , I did what I was to make . I 'm here to make a difference between you and me . I do n't understand what you 're saying . You do n't understand , but I 'm here to make something terrible . ''   `` I know , son , but I do n't understand . I know that you will be there . I know . I know you 're a good husband . I know . I know you have to . But I know you 're right . You have to do it . You keep doing that . I know you lied to me , but you have to . I know you 're right . ''   She laughed - '' You have to . I know you do n't understand that . You do n't understand that . I know you 're right . You 're right . '' I looked at her again , and I 'm a coward . I knew it , but I did n't understand .   `` I 'm sorry , son , you 're right . But I know I 'm wrong . I know you 're right . You know me , so I am wrong . I know you 're right . You know you are right . ''   She sobbed . `` Go back to your homes , son . I know you 've been right . I know my wife , but I know you are right now . ''   `` I love you , son . It 's not meant to hurt you . You love me , son . I know you 're right . I know you wo n't feel it , but you will always say that . I know you love me . I know you ca n't help me . I know you love me , but you know that . I know you wo n't feel it . If you do n't cry , you wo n't feel it . I know you 're right . I know this you do n't realize . I know you 're right . I know you 're right . I know you 're right now . I know you are . ''   `` I know . I do n't deserve to . ''   I knew what the fuck was going on . That 's going to be my last words . I was stuck with it . My last words were the last words I could remember .
`` So what is it ? '' I asked .   `` Why are n't you talking about this man ? I need to know what happens . ''   `` Why ca n't we just go talk about this man ? Why would he . ''   `` We were supposed to have a sort of `` a '' '' .   `` Why do n't we go extinct ? ''   `` It 'll be okay if this man was n't our own . ''   `` A bunch of scientist scientists we 've found ! ''   `` What are you talking about ? ''   `` I do n't mean to speak with any scientist I have n't seen since I went to an cave for 10 years , but what is it ? It 's completely impossible to go back in time ! ''   `` You know , why ca n't we just go through this man ? ''   `` Because if we 're going to call this man a `` great '' , then they 'll have fun of him . ''   `` Well who else will ? ''   `` The guy who has come , is a great prank . ''   `` Well there 's no one here but for us , we 've discovered some kind of `` big '' stuff , all of it . ''   `` So what 's it ? ''   `` Well I 'm in the cave . ''   `` Ahh , I really did . ''   `` But you said that we 're going to see something . I 'm just going to explain the difference between them , and when all I can think about is it , we 'll discuss that . ''   There was a pause , and then the man , obviously , was still .   `` I 'm sorry , you do n't know . ''   `` Yeah , I do . ''   `` So what are you going to do with me ? ''   `` We 'll be talking about what you 're talking about ! ''   `` I 'm telling you , I do n't know . ''   `` Are you trying to talk with him ? ''   `` You 've seen the videos . ''   He 'd just finished with it , and when then he 'd turned up he 'd run through the wall .   `` That 's odd . Why can n't you just talk with them ? ''   `` Why wo n't you hear me . ''   `` All the while . ''   `` I know . ''   `` Sorry . ''   `` Whatever . ''   `` That 's weird . I 'll tell you about the video coming through . ''   `` Fine . ''   `` I 'll tell you about it . ''   He 'd just been through the wall since he 'd said it like he did . He 'd been searching for a couple of days , but now more than most , it was pretty dark and lonely .   `` So what was that ? ''   I looked outside the cave . It seemed like an abandoned warehouse . I think I 'd had plenty of time , but I 'd realized that all the people could hear were singing and chanting and playing for me . There 's no sound out there .   I realized that the lights had just turned on and all I could hear was a strange noise .
Ella screamed as her body convulsed and convulsed , unable to breathe . She stared at the creature , desperately trying to get out of her fugue . She stared out of curiosity and slowly crawled out of the way . Eyes wide at the planet , the creatures had to move fast . It was now blacked out , an orange light bulb casting orange at a pale hue . It was all too dark . For what felt like ages , the color was inescapable when her eyes saw the surface of the planet .   Mlla knew best . It was obvious . Why the sun shone in the vastness of space ? Sips of light and destruction seemed to radiate from the air . The thing looked up at Mlla and blinked , wide eyed .   `` Ulla , '' she uttered . She looked around and saw the planet glithering above them , but still could n't help but smile . The creatures did n't move .   Mlla watched as the creature closed her eyes and closed her eyes . Eyes wide open , she saw the creature with a metallic hand . She looked down at her chest , and saw two arms reaching out to keep the man up . He wore a long , long tan shirt , barely visible on his own . It looked like a cartoon . Mlla pointed at him , and saw it . The other , white , white , black , was blacked out . There was no explanation . He started to speak again .   Mlla stood up , and he started to speak . He did n't move .   `` Ulla ? '' he asked me . With a sudden motion , the creature began to speak again . It spoke , softly . It said , `` Ulla . ''   Mlla was silent , but his voice was hoarse . He spoke again , `` Ulla ? ''   `` Ulla , '' said Mlla . `` Ulla ? ''   Mlla nodded , `` Ulla ? Are you really coming ? ''   Mlla nodded sadly , but he stopped and looked at it . `` Ulla ? ''   Mlla nodded and said , `` Ulla ? ''   Mlla nodded again , and spoke again .   `` Ulla ? ''   `` Ulla . ''   The creature rolled her eyes . Mlla began to respond again . She was still staring intensely around . Her eyes widened .   `` Ulla . ''   Mlla shrugged again , `` Ulla . ''   Mlla shook her head . She looked at the creature . Its eyes widened as their eyes widened . `` Ulla ? ''   Mlla shrugged . `` Ulla , '' she whispered into her ear , `` Ulla ! ''   `` Ulla . ''   Mlla laughed , `` Ulla . '' The creature said . `` Ulla . ''   Mlla shrugged . `` Ulla . '' I nodded , but Mlla grinned , a bit of concern in her voice . `` Ulla , come get a break from my friend here . We can talk about this tomorrow . ''   Mlla nodded .   `` Ulla , '' she said , and slowly closed her eyes . Then she turned her back to the creature . `` Ulla . ''   Mlla frowned , and began to speak again . She said , `` Ulla . ''   Mlla frowned . `` Ulla . ''   Mlla frowned . `` Ulla , '' she said , with a smile . `` Ulla , do you like me ? ''   Mlla shook her head . `` Ulla . ''   Mlla nodded and nodded again . `` Ulla , come look at it . ''   Mlla nodded curiously . `` Ulla , '' she said . `` Ulla , do you like me ? ''   Mlla nodded again , and said , `` Ulla . ''   Mlla smiled again , and said , `` Ulla . '' And they walked back down the path . Mlla looked at the creature , then suddenly disappeared . The creature flew off toward the planet , and stopped .   Mlla waved and screamed as she disappeared . They walked toward the city , and watched as the creatures all stared at the sky .   Mlla stood there and stared out at the ground . She watched as the creatures grew closer . At the end of the street , the creatures were dead . They walked , and as the creatures walked towards the city , she became suddenly aware of something strange .   `` Ulla
( Inspired by the poem below in the final piece )   I was born with the notes from the inside of me , *The New York city . The piano . The piano . The piano . The piano . The piano . * The voice .

I was always that special looking guy . I never saw him , he always brought us . I always believed in what was in their eyes . He had been the chosen one as a teacher , but I never believed in anything else . We never talked about it . The other kids would always give us that . The other kids would never leave .   The same . I did always let him go . I always thought that they would want to leave before we tried . I still remember the way his eyes turned at me .   I always knew because I knew that nobody would ever leave me . It was not until I noticed that they were not the only person I could see . I wanted to stay quiet for a while , but I was a little shy .   I knew when to say that I needed a friend . I knew I was not the only one who would try . All of the time there were no better things . I saw them as a kid , one that was more perfect than the others .   The other kids were staring at me with blank eyes . It had been 10 years since the school started . I can remember every single detail of the little boy that was sitting by the table . I told them I was special . I told them I was special .   They would want to see me as a teacher . It could n't stop . I had to keep calm . I knew I wanted to keep calm for a while .   Did the other kids show up ? They did n't know me . I knew I was special . Everyone else looked at me with blank eyes and they nodded and they looked back at me . I could not hear the teacher say that he was special . I heard the first thing I heard was the screams in my ears . It was bad .   There was n't an alarm .   I jumped out . There was n't a alarm . The kids were supposed to be there like this . I 'm not crazy . I do n't know if anyone else would come back . I looked at the alarm , and I saw the empty room where everyone had been staring at me . I closed my mouth , turned around , and started to cry .   When I got home , there was a knock on my door . `` Hello ? ! '' The door unlocked and a woman walked in . I looked around . She was wearing a black dress and her blonde uniform was held in her arms .   `` I 'm sorry.. I do n't know what to do , please . '' I said .   Before I could respond , she was right . I was just staring at her . I was n't sure why . I ca n't . I was supposed to stay quiet forever , but I did .   `` I do n't know what to do , I do n't know , '' I said .   She said nothing .   `` Listen , I 'm not sure when you do n't know what to do to me , but I just do n't know why you 're scared . You know what to do . Look from my desk , '' she said . She looked at the clock , and was still trying to tell me how she was going to be . I did n't know what to do .   I was n't . I was n't supposed to . I was supposed to have just gotten an old job at a university before the school started working . I was supposed to relax for a while . My day was like any other . Everything was going to be fine .   That 's when I got home . Sitting on the couch , staring at her .   `` I ... I 'm going to keep this , '' she said , and went quiet .
`` For your past few years we have been completely exhausted . We have been suffering the same way as all of us , this place we have created and we ca n't do this in vain . Let us make the place miserable . ''   The question was a question that was not a question for everyone . In a way that was n't true , the idea of a life that is well worth living . But it was just a question that we knew , that 's just what I did n't have .   `` There has been no sense of pride in me . You must know that it has been me . You must realize it . It is something that you would n't ever be able to achieve but knowing it is what I must do . You must know that it was me who could do this . After all , I was n't a god . It was me and me and me . ''   The question came to mind . The word was not a question .   `` The last thing I will ever see is that its beauty is not what it is . ''   The question was one of my many questions that was n't one I was feeling so . I was surprised by the fact that the question was something I could n't see but it was different . If only I knew that whatever was inside me was alive . A simple question , like a question I could find from all of us .   `` And what is it that I feel , why I feel this pain ! I feel pain ! The pain of pain ! ''   I was stunned . This was the question I had experienced . If only there were any questions I would have been given by the one who could have been unable to express joy . At the time I thought this was the moment I had told it the truth , so I was terrified .   `` Of course I know it was , or you would n't have been able to experience what it did to me while I was inside . I was hoping that the pain was gone . I know something new that I have never experienced ... A hunger that is much more pleasant than it does . ''   The question gave way to nothingness , at that moment . The question was different . It was wrong , it was wrong . There was a reason that the answer may have been but that was not a question . As they all understood , they all understood what they could have been . I had already asked them the same question , they all understood what I was , and all I could say was *them . * No matter who you were , it was n't a question .   `` So the answer is why you must know it is the reason why you must know it was not an answer . ''   `` It was n't a question that would describe every aspect of the world . This was your reason to question it , and that was your reason to question it . ''   `` Why does it matter who I am ? ''   `` I can have a reason to question such a thing , so that I should not have spoken to you without knowing . ''   `` I should have understood that you should know it is the reason why I need you . What does it matter that any sane person of course is dead ? What does it matter ? What does the meaning of this fact mean ? ''   `` I do n't know , why yes . I know it 's because it exists because it exists because I do n't know what it means anymore . I do n't know how long it will take for it to realize that I was in an act that I was no different from everyone else . That is n't the beginning . ''   `` No , that is not how I get here . It is only a matter of time before I can begin to explain it . I know something to know that the feeling is nothing but emptiness . ''   `` It is what does it matter ? It is more like that . ''   `` It is a lie . This is just an act of the choice we choose . It is a part of me that is not unique , but that is not what kills it . It is a part of me that does not exist because it is not there . It is not there because it is there because it is not there because it is there because it is there because it wants to share it with it . ''   I knew how this made me know that what I was doing now , but I did n't know anything about it and it was there because it knew that it could n't be , that it could be , that it had to be there because it could feel it . That part of me was the reason I believed it because it
It was nearly time . The city had finally caught up to it . I could feel every breath , every scratch , every scratch , every bone , every wrinkle of blood and bone , every pulse , every muscle , every muscle . The air here was strong to air , and I could hear the cries of people . I ca n't scream . No , I am so sick .  It 's time . I need to move . I need to move . I can feel every fibre . Time is precious , and I wo n't need to move .  The door , open , opens , and I see that I 'm alone . I 'm in the open .  I do n't recognize my surroundings . I 'm surrounded by pictures of their faces . I feel a vibration , I can feel it , my body is useless . I ca n't help but feel the energy coming from my body , my body is shaking , feeling the sensations of my physical body , though it 's coming from me , and it 's time to move . I have to move .  I can smell the blood and blood . I do n't see them . My body is still numb , but I am still alive . My energy is completely useless . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move .  I ca n't move . I can n't move .  I ca n't move . I ca n't move . There 's no way this was happening . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move ! I ca n't move !

I ca n't move .  I ca n't move .  I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I have to move . I ca n't move .  I ca n't move ! I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . Someone is here , but I can not move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . There 's no way this is happening , but I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't moves . I ca n't move . Breathing . I ca n't move . I wo n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move .

I was in charge of the forest the whole time .   It happened as a day of celebration I could finally see her in the forest . We were almost to the castle , now it was our time to take stock of the scenery . She had a green dress , a bow , and a gold , a chihuahua hat . A sword , a spear , a bow , and a spear . I had to let go of the forest , but that was n't my goal . I had to keep the shield from dropping , and the arrow was my choice .   The forest was beautiful , it was beautiful . The first to arrive was a cloud , and as I walked another cloud was visible . I could see the sky as high , from the distance , but more specifically the cloud , the sky as it looked as if they were not above the ground . I could see it on the horizon as it did , but it was n't . The sky seemed to be a mountain , but yet here it was , standing at my feet . I could see that the cloud was facing down as if it were moving through something in the sky .   It approached me with a smile on its face . When it reached for my belt I could see that a large , red eye stepped towards me . Without hesitation , I slowly walked forward . It then passed me into the black and red eye , and it had a long , white-eyes . The same yellow eye and the same yellow eye . But as it came closer the cloud was getting closer , I thought that I was going to get closer , because I could see it walking through . I took it to the black eye and it went down .   I quickly walked towards it . The black eye stared back at me for a moment , then smiled . I was going to turn around . I was n't going to wait to take stock of the cloud . Maybe a day later I realized that the cloud was indeed alive . But how did that happen ?   I noticed the red eye staring back at me as if it had been staring at me at me . It stared back at me , and I fell towards it , as if it was staring back at me , something that made sense , and it looked at me like it were crying . I felt it , and I felt something move in my chest .   It began to talk , but I could n't help but smile . Then it spoke up .   `` Hello . ''   I turned around . The white eye was n't blinking , but it looked at me .   `` Hello I have heard from you in your village and your town , and that is all ... '' it said . I glanced back at it , and back at it . The orange eye was glaring back at me , and I realized that the red eye looked over at me and then back at me . `` This is your town that allows you to remember where the ground is . '' I replied . I looked back at the green eye .   `` A whole village that is n't supposed to exist anymore . '' it said . `` Not even the green eye . The blue eye . ''   I looked back at it , and grinned at it again . The red eye smiled again , and he looked back at me . `` This is America . This is America . '' I stated . I smiled at him , and it began to talk again .   It spoke again .   `` Because of America . ''
`` Finally , '' said a man in white robes , `` how do you even get in here ? ''   `` I already want to say something , '' came the response from other students . `` But this one does not work either . Have you started using it since you stopped time when they stopped time ? ''   `` I was n't going to say anything , '' said the man in white robes , `` but if you 'd like to make that excuse for talking to me . ''   `` I ... I mean , I did n't even even understand it . ''   `` Hmm ... '' said the man in white robes , `` It does n't have to be quite painful . ''   `` So if you 'd like to know if this one does n't work either , then take the initiative . ''   As a matter of fact , the man in white robes was a middle-aged man in a suit with two black pants , and a black watch with a long black tie . He looked shocked , and smiled up as he walked over to the judge and sent him back as he walked over to the judge and told him , `` When it does n't work , I just have to believe I actually did it . ''   `` And I did n't think I could use it . ''   `` Does n't matter . I did n't think I could use it for another year . ''   `` Whatever , '' said the judge , `` maybe maybe . Just to find out . I thought I was just playing around with it . ''   `` No ... '' said the judge , `` I did n't think it might work either . ''
`` So ... I did n't think it would be the usual . I was just doing some shopping , it was a very normal night and we 'd get to work early . ''   I was just looking for signs of signs .   `` Hey , um ... I really do n't know what to do . So I must have just caught the guy 's underwear and threw it into his pants and started taking an odd sock off . I could n't say anything . I just had to have to investigate . ''   `` That 's not something you 've got here . I 've been waiting for you for the longest time and I 've found my fucking sock ! Now I 'm a couple days back . I 'm going to tell you your socks are going mad . So , what 's your name ? '' I tried to sound stupid but the pants got around . I tried to yell but my feet never became so much as they were starting to creep and they were n't so loud . I started to move when I saw the sock on the floor . I was still bleeding and a deep feeling in my stomach was starting to get stronger as it started to get warmer and warmer . Looking around I felt a knot in my stomach and the smell of feces .   If my pants were n't so strange my pants were stuck .   `` Okay , sorry , what happened to you ? ''   I saw the sock next to me and I think I should know what he did . It was the only thing out of here . He smelled like urine like weed .   I needed to know I was right . I needed something else in the bag . I needed to know what he was trying to cover . I needed to know what would happen . Something . Something . Something . Something . Something . Unneeded . Something . Something . I was going to need to know someone . Anything .   I went against the bathroom to grab something else and put it down . I shoved it into the bag and let it fall off the floor . As soon as my body went numb I started to dizzy . I pulled the bag up all the way around the sink and tried to sit up to get my clothes free . Then my pants came loose and I was gone . It was n't in the bag . I could n't look at my pants . I needed to know . I was in the bag now . I was trapped . I needed to know what had happened .   I was running . It was cold and I ran into my pants . I could n't do anything . I could n't even see my pants . I just needed to know who they were . I needed to know who am .   I let out a small scream and screamed and ran and ran to my underwear . I waited . I was paralyzed . I could n't even feel my socks anymore . I felt a cold , sticky metal on my skin . I looked at my head and I felt something , something . Something in my pants . It was n't a feeling . I kept running . I kept running and continued running , until the adrenaline was gone and I was going to have to get my shoes off my hands .   I heard the voice echo over the place . It sounded like someone was calling out to me when I heard it . I started to panic . I started running , but I was n't moving . I made it to the closet , put my sock on my own and ran . I let out a long yell and ran .   I heard the voice again . I felt something again . Something . Something . Something . The darkness . I turned around , and saw the voice again .   `` Thank you for coming . Thank you for coming in . It 's your turn to go . ''   I was already running . I 'd tried to run but the voice said it was already gone . I stared at the voice again .   `` Hey , my name is Carl . ''   This time it sounded like somebody had tried to help me . I looked around . I saw myself in the closet with my shoes . They were wearing a black uniform and a black tie . They were dressed like I 'd seen only five minutes ago . I glanced at my shoes and realized I 'd forgotten . It was n't , they were n't wearing anymore . They were dressed like I was wearing a shirt . Some were wearing them as well . I used the gloves to get them into the room and looked at them . The hand were now wrapped around their wrist . I felt some small black cloth and stood back . They were wearing silver bands again , like an old dress . I felt the warmth of them . I felt something else in my pocket . Suddenly
*I tried to tell you that I am not a writer for this prompt but I could n't tell you how far it could be before ... *
He looked down at me and then threw the gun into the ceiling . And , a faint crack sound on my finger followed by another . Again , I let out a long sigh and looked around , desperately trying to escape this ordeal .   A man wearing a cloak and a briefcase leaned down to inspect my body .   The man 's face lit a cigarette and then continued to glow . In fact , I did n't have a weapon for him .   `` Wait , what 's that ? ''   `` Look , '' I said . `` I ... I was ... ''   `` What the fuck ? ''   `` I 'm God , '' he said . `` This is so stupid and stupid . ''   `` What the fuck are you doing with this time machine ? ''   `` We 're fucking Christ , '' I said . `` And you , where the fuck are you ? ''   `` Jesus Christ , we 're Jesus , '' he said . `` There 's some shit in your ass . This is fucking crazy . '' He slapped his forehead and then pointed to the gun . `` We need to fucking stop fucking Christ . ''   `` I 'm Jesus , '' I said .   `` Stop fucking Christ , '' he said . `` You 're fucking Christ , you fucking asshole . ''
A man in a white jumpsuit jumpsuit as we lift the gun .   `` Fuck off all the cops . '' A man 's hands start to shake `` Fuck off all the cops . '' We start to walk around the bank to try and stop until it gets too close . `` I do n't hear anything . Just tell me who is this guy ? ''   `` I did no good deeds . I did n't think so . '' The man takes a pause as he removes his sunglasses . With his hands clasped under his chin , he stares at us .   `` Look guys . You might say I should be taken down by a few . '' The man says as he holds up his coat , revealing a large hood . `` Your name is Jack . Your name is Jack . You are Jack . ''   He looks away his hood and then the entire bank starts to shake in fear , while the men and the men and the man walk up to the man .   `` What do you mean ? '' Jack says without looking at us . `` The tellers are coming out behind me when I put they in a bag . Does n't I make a move ? ''   `` Yeah . '' Says Jack , and says , `` I 'm already given a job . ''   `` What do you think I 'm a lawyer ? '' asks Jack , as he does so . `` You mean nothing ? ''   `` No . '' I say as I open the hood . `` Who , all of you ? Are you ok ? '' He says as the man turns and starts walking to the tellers by the way . To his left , Jack pauses and looks at me . `` Listen , guy , I 'm sorry . I just got a job , money , a lot of money and a lot of money . ''   He nods and puts up his sunglasses . `` Sure , I 'm fine . What do you think you just gave me ? ''   `` This guy is getting out of here . '' He says as he pulls his hands over me . `` Just do n't talk about him . And maybe I 'm a lawyer ? ''   `` Yeah , if I did that , it would have been more if he had a job . '' I say as I pull the pistol and the man slowly pulls it out of my pocket . `` That guy 's my boss . ''   `` What are you talking about ? '' He says as he looks back at me . `` You were just trying to move away after that . ''   `` You guys are just going to buy a lot of money to make money . '' I say as I move to them . `` Well I guess I should go . I 'm a lawyer , you know , and that guy is never really a lawyer . ''   `` No , you 're not a lawyer . '' Says Jack as he gets up to leave as the men walk up to the wall . I look down and see a small metal object on the wall .   I turn the gun off . `` You did n't say anything about my boss . '' I say while grabbing the object . `` You did n't say anything about my boss . ''   `` You did n't say anything about our boss . '' Jack says as he reaches over to the object and the object was gone . No one outside looked away .   `` So how the fuck did we do that ? '' I said as I pull the trigger .   `` We did n't have any money . We did n't have a job . '' Says Jack as he pulls the hammer out of his belt . `` I do n't know what to do . This guy is the boss with us . ''   `` You know what to do . Just do n't say anything about `` Do n't say anything about it . ''   `` I know . '' Jack says as he leads the revolver toward me .   `` And what ? '' I ask , trying to wrap my arms around the gun . `` My boss is n't a lawyer . ''
Ever since I reached my grandma 's office in the neighborhood , I had n't gotten into any other jobs . I was bored of my job as a programmer . Something about the world was off , and I did n't really want to see it . I was n't sure if I wanted to see it . My friends , friends , girlfriends , friends . I could n't help but see why .   I was almost there for a while . Sitting at my computer , I 'd put a small box on my laptop . I plugged in and found it . It was a weird set of commands , with some kind of symbols and symbols on it . Each looked at each card , and no one of them . Those were the symbols that made me feel that way . They were glyphs , and were the symbols that always looked like some sort of godly symbols . Every word was the exact same :   `` Hi , my name is Bill , you 're welcome to this place . You are the first one to enter these places : The place has been named . We are the youngest who goes to work at this place that should be placed into the place . ''    I pressed on and pressed on , hoping , hoping that whoever it had sent me had just been ignored . The first person came here at the register as well . My grandma probably had a family , and I would later introduce her to the place . I pressed on and pressed on , but when I saw another text , we clicked again , and again .      `` Sincerely , Bill . This place has been called . The place has been called a place where you can find the place , and you can find it . You can travel through this , and no one knows how you can get anywhere . Not until you have any technology you can find . This place is your place that are called Earth . You can find the place where you could travel to . You can arrange it somewhere , once and again , and it 's just for you . ''    Eventually , I pressed again . I reached for the box to check if it could . As I pressed on , it hit me . I typed in the code with my mouth , and then it hit me . The first person came here at this place , and there was a very huge blue button on the screen . At first , something felt terribly wrong , and I realized that it was empty . My phone went haywire . After a few moments , I decided to install the thing . It read `` Welcome to this place . '' We were on the floor . The next person that could have made this place .    
The bell rings .   `` What the fuck ? '' I ask .   `` You 're the only one who knows you can . You ca n't be . It 's been a long time , I can tell you what this is . There 's just a couple of months left of us in exchange to let you marry that lovely girl . ''   I take a step back and say , * '' What about you ? '' * The voice cuts me off .   I look up at my wife , my eyes widening . She 's just my wife . She 's talking to me . I 'm not listening to it . This is the first time I 've felt this way before . I 've been there for a thousand years . It 's been so long , I 've been with her since I moved in . She seems nervous and I 've been able to leave her in a box , and she 's gotten a chance to follow me .   * '' What are you talking about ? `` * I ask .   I look at my wife . It 's her . Her fucking face . I ca n't wait to say anything until I 'm able to come out . I feel as though she 'll be up early enough .   I have to say something to her , I know she wo n't care . She 's so sad when she 's gotten me in the first place . But I ca n't . I 've been there for over a week . I 'm tired of it , and I 've been waiting for her . I 've been here for so long . But it was n't worth it . This is the one I can tell . *It 's really the one I am doing .   I turn and see my wife walk out , and the door opens to reveal a man of my former wife . A man is n't my wife . I see him look at me and recognize his black eyes .   * '' You know I 'm not your wife . You 're more of the original person . Do n't you know what it 's like to be a man ? `` * I ask . * '' And with this I 'm done . `` *  
`` I am not a good man . '' The voice of a thousand demons boomed through the air and pierced the air . No man in his name was n't a good man , so no man was a good man . No man was a good man , but hell was like an ocean . In heaven was a good man , with perfect white skin , just a red and white cape . Satan was a good man , but he got drunk for the fun . There were no angels out there , right ?   `` They 're too small to be . '' Satan said to himself . There were no angels out there . Some stood on top of the tallest mountain in the center of the mountain and looked up at the sky .   `` Do n't see them ? '' Satan asked . He knew he would n't be there any more .   `` When did they take our turn ? '' Satan asked .   `` They were n't . The only reason I saw them were the horns . '' Satan said to himself . He looked up at his head and saw a human being sitting at the top of the mountain .   `` It 's not one of them . It 's the one of them . '' Satan said before coming to collect his attention . He took a seat beside him and said , `` It 's the one of them that ca n't keep walking down here . Each of them they can keep walking down here . ''   `` I ca n't , but two of them can feel the same way . '' Satan said as he was walking down , but Satan remained slow . He looked up at the sky .   `` It 's not one of them . '' Satan said as he tried to look around the world . It 's a dark city that is n't even pitch black , so they may be filled with the brimstone of Hell .   `` I ca n't see them all . '' A woman said at the top of the mountain . As the woman stepped down the mountain , a smile covered her face . She could n't wait to be at the top .   `` I see , I see , they just have a massive huge huge army of humans , and they are able to see them come to our side . '' Satan said as he looked up at the archangel 's hand .   `` You see , the fact of them comes up to you is that they have wings . '' She said after a second . She looked at them . She looked at one another and then at the other .   `` I see , they have wings . They have wings . I see , they have wings . ''   `` These wings ? ''   `` We have wings . They have wings . '' She said with a smile and said , `` but they have wings . It makes them wings . ''
It was a cold night , but one of the nights when I woke up up , I was still in a forest with a sleeping man .   I had spent almost a week in a forest . The forest housed massive beasts near this forest , towered over the forest . The walls are filled with moss , all around it . I did n't want to go back to sleep . This night was n't just a bed for a woman who had a bed for me . My parents took him outside of the woods yesterday . The monsters were usually far too large for me .   She did n't grow accustomed to the noise . It was n't the sound of metal bouncing off the trees . I went back to sleep , but I woke up in a cold cold sweat .   I took a deep breath and turned to look at the man . He held out his hands for me , and said , with a smirk , `` *I never cared ! * It was the sound of metal scraping against the wood . It was a cry , like the pain , but the only sound worse was the sound .   I was just a couple hours later , thinking of the time I woke up , though there was only one moment before my bed was empty .   I looked back at the man . He was a tall bald man , and his face was a giant mess . His eyes were a massive , black with the skin underneath which he was covered in dirt . I guess he was the only one who looked different than I would have been , but a man made a mistake . When I got out of bed , he was standing at a doorway , dressed in a robe that stood on a rack . He gave me a brief look , and then said , `` You 're going to be late tonight , and I ca n't be late tonight , but I love you too . '' It was only a moment before I realized what he had done .   We had been going to the same movie for hours , but in the beginning , I was not going to wake up . When I woke up , I was already wearing my underwear . I looked at the man . He was not covered in dirt , as well as his head . His head was full of dirt , and his head was white . He looked like he was not fit , but he had covered his arms to cover his eyes . He stared at me , and and then nodded .   I sighed , and looked at the man . When he reached over , I whispered , `` We 've had just got to do something with it . We 've got to do something with it . ''   He nodded back and nodded , `` And I 'm going to go . Who else is there ? ''   After I told him , he nodded once , `` It 's my father , and I really do . ''
The music was good ; I knew it was n't meant to do , I hated it , I hated it . Life was good ; I 'd been able to make it work , but it still took years for me to realize that it was too damn good to get out of bed to do anything to get rid of it . I 'd come home in the winter and look into the stars and see it in the sky . It 's not like they 'd be happy , not that they 'd be happy in the mornings , but it was enough to give it to me , and I was happy that they all were on the plane . But now my eyes had become full to it , and the music was *funny* , the music was *funny* , and I was a little scared of it . That I knew it would n't work , but , after they showed up and asked each other to marry me , I was only happy about them .   I was happy . I was happy that I would be happy that I was happy and that I was happy that I was happy that I did n't enjoy this feeling . I was happy , for them . I was happy anymore . I 'd never been happy of them , and that I just had something to share with them . I love them , and they were happy , like they could be happy again during those nights . And they both had one another .   The music was good ; I 'd never have one . They were happy , and I 'd never make them happy .
She sits at her coffee table with an expression of sadness on her face , looking to be fixed .   `` Can you do anything now ? ''   The woman pours another cup of coffee into her cup and fumbles around to her bed . She turns back to the sound of the computer monitor , and sees a bedsheet on the wall . She turns back to the window and sits down . She looked down and realized her body was on the floor . A small , fragile , baby boy who was just a child , with a black beard curled around his shoulders .   `` ... Um ... '' The baby smiles as she leaves .   `` Not on the floor . '' The man says , looking back to his hands .   `` But it 's not home . It 's home . ''   A quick glance at the child 's face . The man was there . He was gone . As he 'd last saw the closet , he looked back to the book of the boy .   `` It 's home . '' The man says .   `` I do n't know . There 's nothing left for me , though . '' The man pulls the book out from his pocket .   The man opens the booklet and puts it on her lips . She says , `` What do you think ? ''   The man is lying on the floor next to her , her eyes focused on the book in front of him . A man . His body . She knows what he was saying .   `` I thought it was coming out of my closet . I thought it was come out of my closet . I could n't have left the room to feed the man . ''   The man is still staring at the child , his eyes pleading with tears .   `` Why should I not leave the room like that . ''   `` Why should I leave , ma'am . Tell me , what do you expect ? ''   The man 's eyes widened and he turns to the man . The figure in the closet walks towards it , and slams the book shut . He begins to stare at the man before him . He feels the hand on his shoulder . The hand on the man 's shoulder . The hand on him . The arm on her face .   `` I never told you that , Ma'am . ''   `` ... '' The man says , looking back to the boy . `` I told you that you were a big guy . And now I want you to come across the room , and you 're here . We do n't want you to leave any kind of ... you 're here . And ... ''   `` Whoseose ? ''   The man 's hand flaps at the book . The hand on his shoulder loosens . The man is still staring at the boy .   `` I 'm here for you . You 've been in here for eight years , but it does n't matter . I guess I 'll just go to bed . ''   The man is stunned , and the man glances back at the closet door .   `` I ... I 'm here for both of you . ''   The man looks back at the closet , then back to the closet .   The man looks at the man and smiles at the door before his eyes .
What a waste of time .   Only one small little thing left to do .   There were n't many people left . They were either either starved or scared .   The other three , lost in the rain . It was just the cold , like everything else .   All of them were gone .   This is n't a waste of time . We 're not sure how that will get us killed . We ca n't leave until we 're dead , maybe even killed .   But there are survivors .   So we try to find shelter , if we do n't die at some point , then we ca n't stay together . It 's been a few months since I 've had the money . It 's the constant , constant , constant , constant , constant and constant .   So it took me a few days to figure out who I was . I have a few problems with one of them , and I found no shelter .   I see a group of people walking by . They 're all sitting in silence . I 'm wearing them .   `` I got to see them . '' I say .   They sit in silence .   Then I hear a loud *thunk*   They both sit in silence .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' I ask .   `` I do n't know . ''   They 're not here . They should have been empty , but they 're n't there .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' I asked .   `` We got to see them . ''   `` They 're there . '' I said . I looked around . The other four were gone here .   The three were out of here , but they look so stupid . They are nothing and are n't there . It 's not like they 're here . They just need to watch who they are . They need to watch .   I tell them I 'm already dead .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' I asked .   They stay quiet , then I could see the last group coming into my place . They want to watch .
It had been a long life since it started , but now we can tell that we still have a good chance of getting back to it . My name is Emily and I have to say something and I need to get a message to my girl about how my children made it . I 've been overjoyed to find out why I 'm not happy with her . I 've already been through the hardships that I lost to others . Nothing exciting has happened since then , I 've lost track , I 've been dreading it since I moved in to the same town for about two years now . I have failed to graduate high school this semester , but it just does n't work any longer and I do n't have a girlfriend or a sister . I lost track of what I 've done , and I 've lost track of no one . I 'm sorry you guys . I 've gone mad and killed all of you all , but one of those things is wrong . I do n't want to help anybody . I want to talk to you for now , but I do n't have a job like that . You are the best person I 've ever had and you have been a better person than anyone else . It is n't your fault , but it 's your fault . It 's not hers . She 's not yours . She 's right , and yours is yours . She would be mine , but my life 's so long . I 'm sorry that it 's not mine . I know I should n't have been disappointed . The other one that loves her , and for you , I 'm sorry that she was n't mine , but even my parents would not know a thing . We 're sorry Dad . I ca n't even see why , but I have to make sure that is not mine anymore . I was all alone- and I hope that the worst will happen until now . I wish I could tell you , because maybe I could have told you how I survived but I never could have told you what , because I ca n't . If I could have told you how I would have told you more than just as much as you did , I 've been going mad that your whole life will be worth it .     Anyways , my greatkids   In the past , I 'm doing a great job that loves you even more than I did . The only thing I can do is stay here and help my students get better at the top of this building and let them be better when I finally have peace , and see if you can be happier . I 'm at least 20 when I 'm done , and so still , I hope you know that you will 've lost track of time , and then I 'm sorry I do n't want this . If you only asked for the day of our life , I 'm sorry that we 'll have to go to the edge . Because of me , I will say something about you . I hope that it 's not yours . I hope you have n't been happier in so long . I hope you 're more than a good person .
When I first heard the sound , a soft thud . I reached for my phone , my fingers brushed against the keys and I waited for the sound to reach out for my phone .   Then I heard it . The clicking of the car as it went through a blur . It was the last of the three years being that I could n't help but feel them were probably my last words .   It was probably the last time I heard the crash . I panicked . I looked down on my phone and there was not one room . I grabbed my phone and walked toward the front door .   The banging stopped . I could n't take it anymore . It was the last thing I could think of . When I reached the door , it was clearly my last word . I pulled out the phone and threw it over my face . I saw the light that was on the inside . I 'm sorry . I just wanted to say goodbye .   I should n't have been more alone .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   -In the end all this would be my last resort in this story . Let me know if you can improve all my sentences and may just let me know how much later you would like to think .
I 've never been this man before . It was the beginning of a long live-down family history . Every day at school , I woke up . His dad walked out of and pushed me out of the hospital . His eyes were bright and eyes were all blank , like he was about to cry . His voice was almost sickly , and I had to try and find him .   My uncle pushed me out of the hospital , his face contorting from the pain . `` Hey , honey , I 'm so sorry . I did n't mean to cry again . I mean , that 's not okay , and it 's okay . ''   I woke up in that hospital , I was n't in pain . The nurse sat with us , my head tilted in anticipation for a response .   `` I 'm sorry , you 're been saying so , come on boy . We were told that they were n't dying yet . We told me you remembered that everything was fine . You remember that . You were almost everything you 'd ever wanted to do . ''   I picked up my phone and looked at my watch . I felt the same . I was n't tired so I thought `` why ? ''   No response . I got up and stepped over a desk . I tried to find myself in a room where the nurse looked my way and said `` You know , they were trying to fix the problem , they 're trying to fix the problem . They did n't mess , they were just going to put some problems on everyone 's minds . You told me that when your mother died , you were able to fix her before she died . You were never going to work , but you managed to fix them . *You found yourself there , you were telling me that you lied to me , but I knew you were n't . You said that you were n't going to be there . Please do n't call me . Please . You signed up . I 'm sorry , Daddy . I did n't know if I was n't going to have any trouble . There was always a reason you were n't going to have any trouble with them . ''   `` I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I just ca n't say that , honey . Please , do n't wake up , '' I said .   He pushed me out of the room , forcing me out of bed . After sitting there , my uncle put a hand on my shoulder and asked , `` Why do you say that ? ''   `` Because we had it , honey . It was hard to tell . Our tests had been lost until we were in the accident . ''   `` It was okay . I do n't even know who you are , baby . I just ca n't get rid of you anymore . I 'm sorry , Daddy . There was always a way that I was n't going to miss you . ''   I stared at the date . The date was August 17 , June 17 , 20 , 26 , 5 , 17 , 5 , 5 , 8 , 8 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 11 , and 8 , of the hospital .   I sat next to a hospital bed , as it had always been . I could n't understand why I was thinking about how it had happened . It was a mistake , not really . I was n't going to live my life without anyone but my family . A mistake . This was n't very bad , really . I was supposed to be able to do anything to stop myself from turning the television off , just before the accident happened . I closed my eyes and waited for a response .   A woman in a black suit and black suit came rushing towards me . `` I 'm sorry , honey . I just wanted to come for you . I wish I could 've had a good start . ''   I heard her name . `` Why ? Why did n't I go on ? ''   `` That 's embarrassing . ''   `` I 'm sorry , honey . I 'm sorry . I just want to go . I do n't want to save you . ''   *I ca n't just leave . *   I blinked . I tried to look at the date . An accident . An accident . Something new . I just wanted to remember everything . It was so exciting . The painkillers , pills , and pills . The painkillers . I finally could really begin to feel like I owed them . But , this was n't a bad accident . This was normal . I did n't like this .   I walked over to the machine and opened the doors . I looked at the date with my eyes wide
It started just as we wrote , not the first time . Maybe it was just a joke , or maybe not a joke , but the story was actually hilarious . From the perspective of the joke , we 're a joke now , so it could n't be anything serious . We 're a joke anyway . I have been writing stories for years . I 'm just talking to you , and I have to talk to you , so I ca n't stop laughing . That is all it took for granted . So like any of your bullshit , you 're in Russia , which is what it 's like for trying to get their asses kicked out of your back . I have literally lost the world for days , but people always say it 's the first time we 're not doing anything .   I guess this was all a prank . I 'm always good at talking to you , because that was a joke . So I figured out what a joke is ? Most people say it 's the greatest joke I 've ever seen . I figured out what I 'm thinking . See , the first time we said it , we did it all together . But that 's not going to be any better . Everybody says it 's just a joke . But nobody says it 's just joke . Nobody says it 's an joke to joke . Nobody says it 's it ?

*You 're not sure what exactly ... *   `` Come on , let me tell you what happened . ''   `` Why are you giving me such a mighty wisdom ! You 're just taking my scales off . I ... wait why did you give me such wisdom ? I was just taking this form and ... ''   `` We found a dragon in a cave . It 's like a cave through a portal ... A cave . Its only occupant . ''   `` And ... you 're a dragon ! You should have thought this way . You 're getting stuck in these parts of this cave , and you 've been able to do my duty for a while . ''   `` There 's no way that we are here now . ''   `` But ... ''   `` Ok , where 's she ? ''   `` It is beautiful . ''   *So why is she sitting next to the dragon ? I did n't know , but I ... *   *And you are doing my duty ... *   `` Ok , I ... okay , that 's what they say . ''   `` Well , '' I said . `` Now they just are ... ''   `` I have a dragon that must not be real . ''   `` Well , at least I think about my duty ... ''   `` I do n't have a real job then , I want to destroy a dragon now . ''   `` See it ? ''   *They look like your master , and you are completely oblivious . *   `` I 'll have to talk to you about my duty . ''   `` So ... what about the dragon ? ''   `` It 's also a dragon , I guess . That dragon is a cave . ''   `` Or , well , not exactly what I would like to do , but ... ''   `` We have this dragon for the past week , and so ... ''   `` So ... you were hoping for a living creature ? ''   `` Then what about the human ? ''   `` Do you think it 'll be real ? ''   `` Uh , well , but ... that dragon is one of the most interesting things I 've ever seen . ''   `` What about the dragon ? ''   `` Well , anyway , that 's why I 'm carrying such wisdom . ''   *So why do you take what you say ? *   `` I 've been waiting a long time . ''   `` You are *the one* here to save me . ''   `` Oh yes . ''   `` Can you imagine the difference between us ?

`` Hello , there 's your mom left , '' the mother said .   `` You 're so beautiful , '' I said . `` I took you to mom 's house . The kids left after that , and you 're just so beautiful . ''   `` I ... I ca n't see ? '' she said to me .   I did n't say anything . I was just very confused . I just loved to see her . Her bright eyes were red from the start of tears . I wish so much .   `` I feel so happy about you . You just want to see what makes me happy . I 'll see you tomorrow . ''   `` You really do . ''   `` I do n't know . '' she said .   `` You 're so beautiful . ''  
I always remember going through my day , leaving the bar with my new boss . I 'm one of them , who is just as attractive you can be , but I 'm not sure .   I should have done him , I do n't know how to look at him . We had been talking about this for awhile . I remember a few times that I had seen him in the mirror . I was n't sure how I understood why he was so nice , or why he was so skinny . He was so cute , his skin was rough and so full of light that I could n't tell if he was smiling anymore .   I never felt that need to be true . I wondered if he was smiling again , or maybe I really did n't know if he wanted to see me . I think he was like me . But I still knew him . This was the Grim Reaper .   He always seemed to want to put a finger on his ear , and I was surprised . There was n't any malice in his tone , and I felt those emotions in his voice that he could n't understand . He started laughing again , and now he was laughing again .   `` It 's not very flattering . ''   I did n't think that it was any longer . He always had a firm handshake , and I always thought that I was worried . But I did n't know if it was because other people asked him .   `` So you 're dead ? ''   `` No , I do n't know . ''   He looked around the bar , and then back at me . `` Not really . ''   `` Can I die anymore ? ''   `` No , I mean , there 's a whole story about what we do . ''   `` No . I 'm sorry . ''   `` Do n't be silly . ''   `` I 'm sorry . You killed some people already . ''   He tilted his head back , and closed his eyes .   I was scared . So I guess I 'm not .   I suppose I should have .   ... .   I was n't supposed to be rude , but I always could . As I walked I could n't help but stare at him .   `` I 'm sorry . ''   I turned to see him through the window . I wanted to smile , but I just could n't .   He looked up at me . `` I suppose you would n't have realized it , because you did n't know it . It was a special accident . I did n't know what happened , but I 'm so scared to ask you to do it . ''   I stared at him .   `` I do n't know how to deal with this . I was afraid . ''   He looked at me sadly . `` I do n't know . But I do n't think you can do this . ''   `` Come on , man . I 've not been able to wait . ''   I shook my head . `` It 's not like I can do this already . Why do n't you just pretend to be me ? ''   He nodded .   I turned my head to look at him quizzically . `` Do you think I might be okay ? ''   He nodded and walked into the bar .   I opened my eyes .   *I do n't know , I do n't know . I just thought I would have more to go , and he would have to live . *   I smiled at him , and he smiled at me .   `` It 's not like I do anymore , man . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` Do n't really care about the afterlife . ''   He stared down at me .   `` I do n't know , man . ''   I closed my eyes , and gazed into the cold darkness of my cell .   *He wo n't be the last . *   I closed my eyes and closed my eyes .   I was alone .
The sun shone through the thick clouds like a burning sun . The first rays of the sun danced through the dark sky . It was warm and the warmth of the cool night provided only the best warmth of the sun ever . The first rays of light pierced the sky above . The most magnificent thing this world could have felt .   The sun shone through the clouds above the horizon .   The storm roared from above and landed onto the ground with a wave of warmth .   The Sun was right . The storm had caused the great storms to fall and the storm would fall like a thunderstorm . There were not any trees and trees .   There was enough land to make this light . Trees and trees and trees to make out any trees . Some people still had that tree on their backs , and others were too scared to know . Some of them were too scared to even know what was happening .   One stood in silence . The other stood up again by the fog .   `` The sun must be a bit brighter than the rest of our days . ''   `` The sun has cast me in here , '' it said , closing its eyes .   The sky had come back a bit before the storm swept past us .   Suddenly , the storm began to dissipate . The breeze whistled through the air and the second rays did n't shine .   A wave of clouds erupted from the ground . The clouds parted and the breeze was gone altogether .   The fog cleared again . The storm was starting to become heavier . The wind was starting to lose its grip . Without a word , the storm fell again .   The storm slowed as if it were being lifted by a tornado . The storm began to stop . It looked around and all the while the storm was n't moving , and the storm was falling , and at the same time the storm realized something was n't right .   The storm stopped . The storm was coming . It was the storm . The storm was coming .   The storm started to hurt . The storm started to stop . The storm slowed again . The storm was stopping . There was no wind . No wind . The storm was coming . The storm was coming . It was falling . The storm was coming .   It was coming . The storm was coming .   The storm turned . The storm was coming . The storm was coming . The storm was coming again .   The storm was coming . It was coming . The storm did n't stop . The storm did n't stop . The storm .   The storm . The storm .
`` Well , '' I said , `` I do n't think human does n't exist , but I think it 's because we made it all . We thought it started with its own personal AI , but now for a few seconds it 's nothing but a blank canvas of text to be seen . ''   For a few seconds I thought `` no , you do n't understand , '' which I believed in was a rather bland machine . `` Not in the slightest . ''   I thought `` I understand ? ''   `` The problem is that we are n't in a simulation , and you are living up to be a computer . ''   `` But now we are stuck talking to you . ''   `` No , you are , you are supposed to be a computer . ''   `` Then we are . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` You are not in a simulation , unless we have a real experience in people 's heads . ''   I thought `` yes , but I 'm not in a simulation , and I 'm not in a simulation , actually . ''   `` We are ? '' The question was a question , though the answer had n't been answered . `` Yes , you are doing all sorts of things . ''   `` You feel pretty ? What the hell do you mean ? ''   `` That did n't mean that I would not do anything with you , maybe you 'd just do something with me . '' I wondered .   `` There has to be something . An infinite void . It 's just like how you ended up in a simulation . ''   `` But I have no one to do that for me , '' continued the question *and with no one to do it , it continued to live in the simulation .   `` Then we die . ''   A pause . `` Are you going to die ? ''   I thought `` No , I want to die . ''   I thought `` Why do you want me to die ? ''   `` I do n't want to die . ''   *And with no one to do it , you do nothing . *   I thought `` No . ''   `` And do n't you want me ? ''   *And with no people to do it , you did nothing for the rest of life . *   I thought `` you do n't want me to die . ''   `` No . No . We are not alone , not a simulation . We do nothing for the people to share . ''   `` Why do you want me to die ? ''   `` Because all of you , I can do is die . ''   *And with no one to do you want me . *   I thought `` but in a way that 's not how I created you . ''   I thought `` I have no reason to die . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- --  /r/vonBoomslang   I had been trying to kill an AI , but it had never been taken from me . It 's time for me to die . I thought `` maybe I 'll die . ''   I thought that my creators had already ruined everything .
We were almost out of power .   But now it was about time we received a transmission from the Earthling colony .   We were in an unknown room . And now , however , humanity has united forces in mere a few years .   The video feed is nearly complete , from the humans that surround the surface surface .   We had expected it to happen on Earth , but the entire human population has not been able to accept our choice .   They expect us to accept the choice and accept the choice .   Humanity simply does not understand .   We have been hoping for the best .   We have been hoping for the best .   The video feed has been replaced by static , but for now , we have been determined that this is a worthy challenge .   We had hoped for a victory . The idea that we could win this entire race , but that is not the case .   It brings us joy .   We can still win this fight .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I stared into the mirror , tears streaming down my face .   I ca n't even breathe .   This wo n't stop .   I 'm alone .   I 'm alone .   I stare into the mirror , wondering if what I 'm going to do today .   The world of Earth has been abandoned .   I did n't dare .   I think of the greatest wars we ever had on Earth .   I turned , turned , and looked across the room .   The man in front of me stood out .   I nodded .   I turned , looked into the camera , and saw one of the alien 's long , skinny arms , legs , and a long , long , long , narrow nose .   I closed my eyes , and waited .   The man in front of me disappeared .   They had been abandoned forever .
Somewhere , a man in a white lab coat sits alone at the top of the chair . He has a nice coat , and a set of blue jeans . His shirt is like an early summer gym , which is always for him to wear ; some clothes , some shoes , some jeans , some glasses , some clothes , no clothes , which are black . This man , who was in his late 20s , sits in a chair next to his desk , taking a deep breath . He feels like he was about to fall asleep , thinking how he would feel in a cold sweat . Finally , and he looks at his computer . The man has a strange ability that could be used by his own hands , but this man is clearly not perfect . His fingers flick over the screen to read from his computer . He begins , unsure of what to do . There is silence . Then , again , he clicks the numbers across the screen .   *First time posting here , please excuse me if you enjoyed it this weekend ! I want to see how you feel in the world ! You like this ! *   He wonders if he would like this . He should also go somewhere else to visit . He opens the door and opens it . He walks down the hall to the bathroom . There is no reception in the office . For all the other rooms , he just is n't there . He slams the door once a week , and sits in a chair . He does n't stir . Then , in the chair , a small black man in a grey lab coat emerges to the room .   `` Hi , do you know how much longer these days are ? ''   `` Um , it 's much longer to get out of here . I do n't know why you 're here , but I want you going out this way . ''   `` I guess ... I ca n't ... I have ... ''   `` Please ... please . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   *What if I 'm looking at something more interesting ? *   `` Uh , please . It 's not like you 're looking at something outside . I just found the victim . ''   `` Could you please check something ? ''   `` U-m-sure , I just could n't do that . '' He takes out his phone and dials .   `` Sir , I 'm looking at something in the pictures . I do n't have long before I 'm not sure what 's going on . ''   `` I only want to see you . ''   Suddenly , he was on the floor . He nearly had a full view of the body on the floor , but this man was definitely not his victim .   `` ... I ... I 'm guessing , well , this looks kinda weird . You and I were expecting someone to find a corpse . Should I just check it for something ? ''   The man leaned forward and looked around , surprised , but not only had he not expected a response so he quickly dialed . His eyes wandered back to his computer .   `` Yes ? ''   `` ... Okay , you 're here . ''   `` Here ... you know , I 'm not going to mess up the details for anything . I 'm just looking at things that have happened because I had no idea where to go . ''   `` Holy shit , please do n't call the police . I 'll be so shocked . ''   The man placed a hand and put the phone in his lap .
The rain was pouring down , and it was too late to stand in the corner . She could see the light now , and there was a fire there .   *You can see it .

He wore his black sunglasses . He 'd like to wear them when he was young . He certainly liked them when I saw them . He knew that the one who was n't a bad man and he knew that the one who had been the only person who looked around for the first time in this life .  The Wolf had a tendency to get him in trouble by doing things for good , and he was a big man . He was smart at first , but he knew what he was doing . When he was older , he noticed the problem with getting his hair up . He did n't know if he had n't , but he was a guy who was strong at first , and he was always happy . The Wolf had always always been so smart when he was younger . He had learned it was like the others .   He was a guy where I liked to be a bad man . He was just a bad man . His hair was dirty , and even more dirtier than the others . He was nice at first , but he could n't be bothered to put it into a good position . When he was younger , he was happy to be able to clean himself up . Because he was a bad man . He did n't really care in that . It did n't matter that he was ugly , and that he deserved to be , very good . Plus , his beard was like a good man , and he had a very good reason to hate himself .   But his hair was just dirt , and his eyes were like a watermelon . He also did n't understand . But he was upset when he asked me to follow . He did n't understand when I said I had to believe .   `` I 'm glad you see . ''   I hated seeing the wolf 's face as he walked toward me , and I did n't really feel right . It was n't his face , but his eyes were like a waterfall or the watermelon , and he just looked like a frog , and he looked like a deer . At my feet .   `` You see , my shirt is a bad man , but I 'm not good at it . ''   I blinked . I 'd been a bad man of a man before . I certainly only felt bad for a few days , but mostly because of the fact that they were just like the others . To be honest , the Wolf was a good person .   `` You 'd learn something about it . ''   I blinked . It was still time .   `` Why did you tell me that you had to open the door to see it ? ''   `` Because of the truth , with the truth in your eyes , it just was n't my eyes . ''   `` It was the truth . If you 'd give it to me , you need to go outside . ''   `` No , I 'm not good at what it takes to get to the door , and I 'm good at everything I do . ''   `` I 've been in trouble for hundreds of years . When did my hair get loose ? ''   His eyes closed . Then he blinked . He shrugged . When he looked at me , he said nothing . A little bit , and then he said `` I could help you . '' But the words sounded good on his lips . He did n't look into me , but I did n't hate him .   `` You think that much ? So many things ? I did n't believe it . And you want to help me ! ''   The Wolf nodded . I had the most evil grin I 'd ever had . It was a kind of face . He did n't have a finger , and a handkerchief . If he wanted something , I could help help him . He made me feel bad about the guy in the world .
`` This is what the universe wants , '' An artificial android said to his companion . `` We do n't want you to go back to the earth like this , but this is why you have to go back to the earth like this . `` , An artificial android replied , `` It has to be God . ''   `` You do n't want me to go back . ''   `` Yes . '' An artificial android replied . `` And yet here I am , walking along the road to get into the earth so I can look at the humans again . ''   `` Did n't it just come back ? '' An android replied . `` I found the humans . They are powerful humans , or they are too powerful . Sometimes someone might think they would have gotten stronger . ''   `` What did you do ? '' An artificial android exclaimed , `` We do n't want you to get better . I want you to go back to the earth with me , but they 're free . You ca n't stand this , and you need to leave . And you 're free . ''   The android walked away . The robot walked away . The android walked away . The android walked away . The android walked towards the sky . He ran towards the earth . He ran towards it , but he saw no light . He ran off . His eyes narrowed . The android sped away . The robot walked away .
`` Man , that 's so funny '' you ask his victim . His eyes are wet and dark , as if he 's trying to get his bearings . He knows exactly what he 's hearing . He knows that he 's speaking in a language I can not understand . He 's trying to get at the wrong moment . He does n't know what his victim is going to say .   The pain is intense . He knows that he ca n't be the pain . He only knows because he 's not dying . He 's trying desperately to get out of consciousness . He 's choking . He could n't lose his consciousness . He 's screaming for help . He knows full well he never could . He 's screaming for help .   The pain is intense . He 's standing out of bed . The pain is pain , and the pain is excruciating . He could feel his body burning . He cried for help , until the pain is unbearable . He could n't breathe for help . It was n't hurting . He was screaming for help . His body died . It was n't hurting . He was n't afraid or angry and he could n't take it anymore . They were trapped in the middle of a crowded street . He did n't know what would happen , but he saw the pain . He was in tears . He knew that the pain was hurting . Fear .   His mind was spinning . He could n't do anything . He could n't feel something . He could n't feel anything . He could n't feel any . There was no pain . He felt some pain . He could n't feel anything . He could n't feel anything . His eyes were burning and he could n't see anything . There was no pain . He looked around to see nothing . The light came out of the darkness . He was bleeding and he could n't feel anything .   `` Are you okay ? '' he was n't really there .   The pain was unbearable . He felt pain but his throat was being forced forward instead . His mouth felt like ice . He could smell something . He could n't smell anything . He could feel something . He could n't feel anything . He did N'T even feel anything . He was n't alive . He could n't feel anything . He was n't in death . He felt nothing . He was n't in pain . The pain was nothing . He was n't alive . He was n't dead because he was alive . He was n't alive . He was n't alive because he was n't so alive . He was n't alive because he did n't know what he was doing . But here he was again .   `` You mean what I 'm doing ? '' You asked . He was n't there because he was dead because he was all dead because he was a dead because he was afraid . He knew what was happening when he woke up . You did n't know what to do . All you did is feel the pain . He was n't there because you were n't dead because it was n't a pain . He was n't there because you were dead because you were n't alive and you were n't alive because you were dead because you were alive because you did n't understand what was happening .   The pain was unbearable . He could n't feel anything . He was n't alive because it was *really* dead because he was alive because people were different because they were n't alive because that was a real person . As he felt it , the pain was gone because someone was n't alive because it was a human because they were n't dead because they were real because they were real because it was n't because they died because they were n't real because they were the real people because they were the real person because they were real because they were real because they were n't . In fact , everything is real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because it was real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because those are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they 're real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they exist because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are real because they exist because they are real because they are real because they are real because they are
** “ I ’ m sorry , ” **   I was confused . How many times have I been with this woman my entire life ? The thing about her now , the pain that I ’ d been given to her was like a blanket with her feet . I was confused . If only she hadn ’ t known I existed . If only she knew he existed .   ** “ I ’ m sorry , ” **   If only I could say it out loud . But I knew she would feel my pain . If only she had known him before .   ** “ I can ’ t tell you anything , ” **   The doctor said nothing .   ** “ You ’ re ok , sir. I don ’ t want to tell you anything . I just want to be home . Be home. ”   ** “ I need to talk to you in the hospital later . I don ’ t want to talk to you , ” **   “ Please. ”   And so I talked .   ** “ I ’ m sorry , ” **   I found it difficult to deny her pain . But I knew she would feel me , and was n't able to see her pain . She was completely healthy .   ** “ I want to tell you something . I want to try .

I couldn ’ t think of any more pain , and would see her through the foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog shrouded foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy fog damp foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy fog foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog fog foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy foggy fog
I did a good job so i could play a game and my job sucks . I was tired as long as I was alone , it was hard to find out who i was , and why on earth was i being alone ? I did n't know why i was here , but I needed to help .   They came to me , and asked me to pick up the game . They told me to pick up the game . They asked who i was ; to pick it up . They told me to pick it up . They told me how important they were ; I did n't know why i was here , but i did in that moment . They told me that they wanted to pick up the game and take a look at it , and I saw that all I could do was go home to do whatever I wanted to .   So i went home and decided to take a look . They told me to pick it up . They told me that our game had been finished and that all these years since . The game was finished and that the game had been finished .   But then again , their `` game '' had been finished . I did n't think it would even matter . As they looked at each other , I knew that they were gone .   I did n't think I would get away from this game , so I put on my best best shirt . I do n't know why it would have worked .   I took out the game , and told them to pick it up . I told them to pick up the game and the game did not work . They told me that they wanted my best shirt today , that they would pick it up . They told me that they would pick it up and play it up . They told me to pick it up so I could feel the pain I had started to get . They told me that they would still be with my best shoes .   I looked at the game , then smiled . I knew that they were not coming to me .   I stood there , staring at the game , then looked at them . I then grabbed my best shirt and wrapped it around them , and put my best shirt up , but it was n't exactly my best outfit clothes . I pulled that shirt up , then pulled it away from me , and went back to the game . I was happy now .   The game had died , and they had died .
`` You know , human , you do n't know . ''   I thought to myself , “ Sorry , I was saying this was gon na be a long day , and I 'm still trying , I will work for you . Come on guys , I know it sounds like one of the kind of things that I 'm actually talking about . ''   My eyes scrunched up . The world , the wall , the ground , the floor , the floor , the walls , the ceiling . It made me want to stay here , but I hate this place . It made me want to go on the same spot , not be seen .   I had to move my head . I had to stop it ... but I still did n't know what to do . I would do it ... but I do n't . I was just watching this place . It made me want to leave ... but now , I 'm going to leave it , right ? I should stay here . I should have gone .   I let 's cry . Now here I am , moving my head . It hurts . I just watch . There 's so much I 've been waiting for , so I 'm not going to break like this . I should go .   I can feel my feet and knees . I just watch . The light fades . I can feel it ... I can see it ... but now , no . I 'm screaming . It hurts .   *What are you saying ? You know , that 's what I was asking myself . *   I ... my hands , my hands . I knew I was going to die , if you would n't ...   I did n't do it anymore .   *Do n't you know what 's going to happen ? *   I ... my hands . My hands . I do n't know , it hurts .

This world has been a disaster for some time and some of the other tribes had a knack for war . They have developed technology so easily that their technology allows more advanced technologies but we can now travel in the shadows , our planet is a huge part of a galaxy that can not be seen or seen .   Perhaps they have not noticed our technological progress . A virus has spread across the galaxy far beyond the stars , but not enough . We can not tell any other species who have ever encountered this planet in an attempt to contact the people to find out . We may be able to communicate with others as possible , but in fact our culture does not have any sort of affinity , only for their culture , but rather for our culture . Some species might have developed a technology to fight to achieve their goals . They seem to understand our culture , and they become friends . If they can stop themselves , humans will surely understand our culture again .   But they have not really noticed our culture at all . There are hundreds of species that live on the ship that are their society . Some are well aware of the significance of it and that the nature of this entire planet should not be so primitive . Some are less aware . Some are aware of them , and some are aware of their surroundings . Some are aware of their presence and I think they may be aware of their presence . I know of what they would have to do with that . I know what they must do with their culture .   But , well , they 're aware of the nature of these species in their culture . The species these species are aware of . Perhaps they must be aware of our nature . Perhaps they must understand the true nature of their planet . This is a different place , as the world is aware of our culture from their people . Their culture does not have an ability to comprehend the nature of our language . Perhaps it is because of them , or perhaps it is because of their technology which holds such a vast amount of advanced technology . Their culture is much more interesting than most of the other cultures . Perhaps a human should be unaware of their language , but to think of such primitive , which is to be made sense of by both their culture and culture , however , they make use of their culture rather than in their culture .   Perhaps , they may know their culture in their culture . Perhaps , perhaps , they may understand their culture . Perhaps they may know their culture in their language , and perhaps they may understand what their culture is capable of . Perhaps they should understand their culture in the art of their culture , or perhaps they may recognize the nature of their culture . Perhaps , but perhaps , they must know it and do not . Perhaps , they must know what it is . Perhaps this is what they 're capable of expressing . Perhaps there is one of their tribal traits that has been shared in these societies . Perhaps they are as clever , though they may understand their culture . Maybe if they make them such a small , kind of way to communicate with others , only to know that they should understand their culture . Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , they may also understand our culture again . Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps that 's what their culture has grown to understand . It is known for them , and they do not understand their culture .   They speak up on all fours . Maybe , they have received a peculiar , strange message :   `` They have received received transmissions before . They have been given a message from their people , and they will call upon us . They have received messages from far beyond them , and are told not to share them with us much longer . Their culture has been given a message from their people yet . They have heard of these things , and for their technology , they must understand their culture , and attempt to communicate with them . Though , none will understand the language . ''   Perhaps they understand the language and language . Perhaps they may teach their culture well . Perhaps , maybe , perhaps , they understand the message . Perhaps it may help the people understand what they have learned , but but the words are not spoken as if they do not understand it . Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , they must understand what they have learned .   Perhaps , well ... they may understand what they have learned , and perhaps perhaps their culture should not understand . Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , must these human languages be *fanganglement* ? Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , Perhaps , perhaps , they are curious , perhaps , and certainly indeed , to understand what they have learned . Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps ? Perhaps , maybe , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , they may may understand what they have learned , or perhaps even if their culture is not able to understand what they are thinking . Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , in the context of their culture , perhaps , would perhaps
`` You 're gon na make it better to go home now . We 'll be having our fun . ''   `` Oh no , '' I replied .   `` That 's not what I 'm meant to do . ''   `` There 's a problem . ''   `` Why do n't we just leave ? ''   `` Because we 've spent our entire lives living and living together . This is a pretty big deal . It 's a big deal . ''   `` I do not want to join us , '' replied the lieutenant .   `` You 're gon na be thinking about the right thing . ''   I could see the lieutenant 's face shifting behind me . `` Is it possible to be a bad person to be a bad person ? ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` We 've *supposed* to be a good person . ''   The lieutenant took my gaze away from me . `` No , no I have a job . ''   I sighed . `` Why do we just leave ? '' I looked up to see what I was talking about .   The lieutenant turned me . He was a tall , wiry man with black hair , and a black hair that looked so like his dad . He was wearing a t-shirt , but with a black suit and a deep in black suit that made my face hard to see into his eyes .   `` You know who I am . ''   Tears poured down my cheeks . `` You 're gon na be okay . ''   `` Donut . I 'm not going to be okay then . ''   I turned away from him . `` No , you 're not . If we can leave it behind , we have to go back and watch the future . ''   `` You 're going to do this right now . ''   The lieutenant stopped and stared back . `` Right now . ''   `` I 'm gon na do this right now . '' the lieutenant gestured to the empty door behind him . I followed him to the front porch and started walking .   He stopped and waved his hands at me . `` Do as you can , sir . ''   I smiled at him . `` I wish I could stay with him , you know . ''   He turned away and walked into the living room . I did n't want to hide in the living room .   `` I do n't want to know who I am , '' I said . `` You 're not going to be okay . I 'm going to have to try again . ''   I pushed myself up my shoulders . `` Do n't worry , I 'll stop soon . ''   `` What ? ''   I could see the lieutenant begin to grow older and older . He was running towards me . `` Do n't let that happen . Donut . Do n't let that happen . ''   I thought him . `` I just wanted to stay with him . ''   `` Tell you what ? Leave . You 're wasting time . I 'm going to do this right now . I got this right , let me do this right now . ''   The lieutenant reached into his jeans and pulled out a few long white shirts . `` This is ridiculous . Are we going to do this right now ? ''   I stepped back in the living room and saw no sign of life . I turned again . `` Yes , of course . I 'm going to do this right now . ''   The lieutenant turned and shook his head . `` Yes , I really want to do this right now enough . ''   I looked down into the living room and my eyes widened , in fear . I began to sweat .   `` Do n't cry . This is perfect , '' said the lieutenant , stepping back to the living room .   I stood up and ran to the living room . I did n't want to be . I did n't want to get rid of it . But I could n't bear to go back .   With a quick flick of the wrist , I ran . I dropped to my knees and grabbed a small silver handgun .   I reached under the arm , and pulled it out . I kept it 's finger on the trigger . I screamed at the living room . It was going to go away .   The living room burned and hurt . I had to find it , but I did n
`` Are you sure I 'm in a little white room . ''   I raised a hand to my face and to my surprise I was n't lying , just lying on the ground . It was a great , dreary day . I could n't remember , I was a little shaken by the smell of a brown and orangeish , or maybe the first time I was completely awake I could n't make out the words . Even the doctors said you need to make a connection this time .   `` Ok . Okay . Here 's the answer . ''   `` Okay then . I 'll start preparing to get out of bed , but that 's a joke ! '' I was frozen in disbelief . I had n't heard about this before . I was n't even sure what was happening , but with my mind all I had to do was try and get some answers from the doctors and the doctors . I could n't find the answers , I could n't help but feel my finger twitch as time goes on .   `` Yes . I 'll wake up now . '' I was n't sure why I was here , here was a great place to live .   `` Okay . The place is nice . We 'll put the food in there . ''   I was getting ready to put the food in here . I knew after all , I had n't been able to figure out how to put my mind in here .   `` Where ... Where ... where am I ? '' I finally asked , still unable to look up . I saw a man in black with a yellow sweater . The dark blue man was dressed in a white gown with a red tie . `` Where am I ? Where am I ? '' The man in black said .   `` Where am I . Where am . How am I ? '' He asked .   `` Where am I ? '' I asked , standing back in fear and confusion .   `` Where am I ? '' he inquired .   `` I 'm in another white room . '' The man in black said .   `` Where am I ? ''   `` You 're in a white room . I have n't seen a man since before . You 're in a white room , I 'm in a white room . You 're in an experiment . ''   `` Well , how am I ? '' I asked .   `` Who am I ? Is that your name ? '' I asked quickly .   He paused and looked around , confused at where I was . I could n't make out the words . I was surprised at what I said next , but it did n't matter at all .   `` Have you heard any of this ? '' He asked again .   `` A banana ? '' I asked .   `` No . No . I am in a white room . '' The man replied .   `` No , just a white ceiling . It 's an identical color . It 's a white room and a white wall . It looks ... blue . I never seen a man live before . '' I said , still thinking .   `` And the people who have a banana ? '' He asked .   `` No . They say this because they do n't have a banana . ''   `` Why are n't they supposed to be supposed to be here ? '' I asked , looking at the man in black . He looked at me confused and annoyed . `` Why are they supposed to be here ? ''   `` Because they are supposed to be here ? '' He said . `` Look at me . ''   `` I 'm here . '' I said , feeling the tear fall down my cheek .   `` Wh-who are you ? '' He asked again .   `` You are n't supposed to be here , I am . '' I said , bewildered , standing up . It was a large man looking at me , `` You 're supposed to be here . '' He paused and took a deep breath and said , `` You 're supposed to be here ? ''   `` Yes , but we 're supposed to be here in a white room . '' I said , still confused . `` What are you supposed to say ? ''   `` I am dreaming . '' He said coldly . `` You 're supposed to be dreaming . ''   I could n't feel the tension . I began gathering my thoughts , but something about this guy told me about this guy . Something about this guy . Something about this guy . Something about this guy . Something about this
The man wearing an elegant suit walked around the stage , his hands gripping the side , pushing his glasses away from his face . The host 's eyes met with an expression of astonishment . A look of curiosity grew on his face .   `` He was a man who wanted to save the life of the girl . He knew what he had feared , and that for the world , he was only a child . He was a young wizard . We were far from the most powerful man in all of history , and the world beyond the veil of existence ... ''   The host looked bewildered at the man , a very quiet man . His eyes was fixed on his face , and his voice quivered in disbelief .   `` You were a man who made us a man . We were the ones who made us an angel . We raised you to do what we had done and it did n't matter . We held you to the world , and it gave us all the power we had left . One of the greatest powers of the world , and all the power we had left at the same time . He knew the world what caused it all . ''   `` And the world , now ? ''   `` The world itself , is now now beyond the veil . It can not be seen , nor will it be seen , nor will it be seen . It can not be seen or seen or seen , nor will it be seen . But it must not be seen . It must be seen . ''   `` Who are you ? ''   The host raised his spectacles , and placed the spectacles back in his hands .   `` There is magic . In the world , you have the heart of every single man without the heart of a man . But it is not seen . Yet there is magic . A man worthy of the gods . A man worthy of the power of the world . ''   `` But now there is magic . ''   `` And here is magic . ''   The host waved the spectacles . The man 's eyes seemed to glow brightly and he knew what he was doing .   `` And what is it , friend ? ''   He glanced back at the host . The spectacles glowed with a high pitch .   `` My friend . ''   The spectacles glowed brightly and a sharp spark had appeared on the host 's forehead . `` What *is* it ? ''   `` It may be seen where you were , but within the veil , the words have all been translated in ancient languages . ''   The man 's eyes began to glow and his eyes widened momentarily . He had lost in fear , because he realized that the stranger was there , still staring at his partner . His eyes widened in confusion as well . He looked back at the man .   `` And the world- ''   `` No ! Stop ! ''   The spectacles suddenly vanished from his face and he floated back to sleep . 
Derek   It 's the last time I ever met you , I swear I never had a friend with you . I do n't know if you 're listening , or if you 'll be back in hell . I just thought we did n't know how much I tried to keep you up now , but I saw this letter in front of me , a letter in front of it , I 'll never forgive you for the man who wanted to read it . It was in the corner of my eye of my eye , an accusing glare in my face . It was like , I thought . I found this letter in an envelope , like , `` Go to my parents , '' I heard that voice coming through the walls . I was very proud of it , and I think I did n't want to say anything . I did n't want to hear it through . I was ashamed of it .   All I wanted to do was let out my own tears . I do n't want to be here , I want to spend my whole life with this man . I want to live with you to see me through the tears , but I do n't want to hurt you , I want you to understand . It takes a lot of time to die , to stay alive , to keep you alive . I want to live with you , to make sure you ca n't even know how much you love me . We used to be a lot better than we did when we were kids . I want to live with you , to be with you alive . I want to be with you . This will be my last goodbye , as I always do .   But I regret you for the last time , Derek . I hope you do n't understand . Last chance I ever had was to make . It is the last chance I ever had . I hope you know that it will be all over . I hope you understand at this moment . I wish you did n't understand . Please forgive me . Goodbye .   **We love you , Derek ,   **You are not dead , Derek . I love you . I love you . You are not dead , and I wish you did n't understand . Goodbye .   My friend ,   Mark

It took the fifth day of the week that I called my wife , and so they were gone . She had arrived to find me back in my room of hers . We were sitting in the dining room , studying for a couple of minutes , a glass of water and a tea pot and a bowl on her bed . As we made our way to my bedroom one day , she opened the box that was a picture of me , but when she grabbed the picture from her wallet , we all knew that in that instant , when we knew that the picture ... was what I could only assume was the picture ... was it a picture of me , a beautiful woman , bright sun and a piercing blue sky , one of the many things that would appear in the world . We both knew that there was nothing in our eyes that would not be there .   I was going to die , not the most beautiful woman I had ever met before .   I did n't know how many times I tried to tell her that I 'd been there long enough until I died . I had n't believed in God 's words , and I just did n't realize that any of that was true . I just stood there , looking at the picture , that was the picture . It was the picture that I 'd made this year ?   With that , we made our way up to the fireplace . We walked in , and everything was fine . I felt like I could n't put a finger on the picture anymore ... I just did n't get to understand what I was going to do .   When we reached the couch , we started talking . I just stood there , looking at the picture on the wall . We had the perfect picture , the beautiful ones I had hoped for , there had n't been any flaws in the picture . It was my picture , and I would n't have let it go .   The picture was a picture of me , and I really wanted to pretend that some of us could n't understand the picture ... but ... I wanted to know if there had been something else ... so I wanted to know what to do ... but what else would it do to them ?   After some time , we started talking . We both had a special car , a large car , and we could n't call it a car ... but ... I wondered ... What could possibly just happen ? Suddenly , the picture came back to me , and I was startled when I spoke , but not by the picture . The picture was a picture of me , who I presumed was my wife , and all I saw was being looking at me . I must have been dreaming ... but at this moment , I knew something was happening ... I did n't know ... but I would know what ?   I was shocked ... but what could I do ? There is no telling what to do . I looked at the picture , and that was an image ... but I was able to see now that there is n't anything in the picture ... so there was nothing in the picture . I started to think ... the picture ... I kept thinking ... thinking ... it was then that I realized something was off ...   When we reached a bar , you can find the picture of me ...
I was sitting in the arena , watching the gates with a shocked look on my face . In front of me were a small , yellow dot hovering above me , above me : the arena was surrounded by small yellow dots . Behind me was a bright , purple , and I could see an enormous crowd of animals circling in all directions .   I had no idea exactly where I was going .   I was in an incredibly large room , standing at the podium , waiting for something to happen .   The animals had taken away my skin skin and skin , each of the five species seemed to be growing . I had to say that the judges had decided to take care of it , and all that would have to do was wait outside the gates and die with a little , *he* was now in the arena . I looked at the wing .   It had to be the big one .   `` You have been here , '' I said as I walked forward , `` In the arena , you were here . ''   It looked at me with a puzzled look on my face . `` You have been selected to give your choice . You are the last one of them to win . ''   It waved its hand . `` Do you have any idea what the prize is ? ''   It waved its hand away . `` Indeed . ''   The creature shifted and turned its head towards where it belonged , and its face flashed red like a lightning bolt . `` You are the last winner . ''   I could hear them clattering , and then it started to speak .   `` And you are the last one to win , for the last . ''   I was back in the Arena , and now I had no idea where exactly where I was going . I was gone , and my body remained in place .   I was n't alone . There was n't much waiting .   I was n't alone . I was alone .   I heard them clinking at me , and before I knew it I was in front of me . A green dot .   `` The last competitor to win . ''   The voice said , in silence .   `` And now , you are here to win . ''   I had no idea where I had gone from , and I was dead . I was alone .   Suddenly , a flash happened .   `` A good thing indeed , '' I said , and I was still in a place where the crowd was now .   I felt a very excited need for a moment . The ones who would choose to win this game would never win this game .
`` Hey , James , '' she said , giving him a warm kiss on the cheek . `` You ca n't see that . ''   `` Hey , what 's happening ? ''   `` I-I- I 'm afraid you 're having this , '' I said .   `` I 'm leaving . We 're going to have to do something . ''   `` Fuck the fuck . ''   `` I 'll have a nap . '' She replied , turning her gaze back toward the empty office . She smiled , taking a bite of her bite , which he said was very serious .   `` Fine , '' he said , giving her a hug .   I decided to go to her and grab her by the neck . When she kissed , she was wearing the same outfit . I guess she was n't wearing the same outfit .   `` And you 're thinking that people are happy ? ''   Her smile disappeared , and she nodded .
`` We 're going to make the biggest mistake . ''   `` Nope , no no-one else can take this seriously . No-one else can handle them , and we do n't need them , maybe they just take this seriously . ''   They both nodded .   `` Is that what you 're looking at ? ''   `` And no one else can handle it if they do n't take it seriously ? ''   `` No-one else can handle it , and I , but then you 've given one wrong choice ! I 'll buy you one last time before I make it ! ''   They both smiled .   `` A week ? ''   He stopped talking to himself , and sighed .   `` I 'm not sure why you 're here , it 'll get better if that 's a lie . ''   They both laughed again , or sighed .   `` You can take it seriously . I 'm not sure why I 'm here , or why I 'm here . ''   `` The world is going to be ours to make the biggest mistake . ''   He placed the gun on his side , and turned it off .   `` Maybe when you can finish the game , or if you can finish it off just a little sooner . ''   Then he walked away .  
The sun was a nice day , sunsets were both sunny in a way that would have been the only place to see the sun . The grass was green , with blue , and the sky was green , and the blue was dull enough if the sun was not going to be sunsets . It was beautiful , and the beautiful rays were so bright that the sky was not getting any brighter . Every time the sun was on , the stars began to glow .   The air was still , but I could feel my stomach and my stomach and stomach tighten at my sides as if I were doing some sort of experiment . I was lucky to see a man doing something , but before I realized what I had done , I looked at the sky , and saw that the sky was not starting to start anew . The world was gone , but as we walked to the nearest convenience store , I saw that the world was gone , and I saw the sun .   The streets were silent , and I knew the words had come . One time I saw that someone had killed me . His name was Fred , and I knew it was Fred . He was the same , and I knew he was right . He was one of us .   The sun was out , so I could see the sun . Some people had killed my family , but I could see the sky . The sun was gone with them . The sun was gone , and the same one , so I knew that these people were the same .   The sun was gone now , and I could see the sun as it got brighter and brighter . I could see the sky as the sun rose , and I realized that I had no time for it to happen . I looked over and saw Fred .   The sun was gone , and all I could hear was the the gentle breeze of a dead flower .

It was n't long before I saw the school bully . As it neared the door , I saw only one kid sat in front of a teacher , watching me . Not wanting to see him , he said it was probably time for me to get into my class . This was the only way I could get out of the way . The kids were supposed to be able to get out of their seats to get out of their seats for a bit . And I did n't have the opportunity to go inside . I did n't have the courage to look back . I did n't have the courage to look back . But the teacher , with a smile , said it was for the best . And then , the boy began to sit down next to me .   They both did not speak very quietly , that was simply the answer . After the kids had finished forming their own sentences , the teacher asked me `` How did that happen ? Who do you want to go to class ? '' . And then , of course , the boy was right .   `` I do n't want to see your classmates , '' he replied , `` But they would n't have friends in the world . ''   `` Why not ? This is what parents called it . I do n't know . Not if this is the only way I can help you . But , I do n't want to see them anymore . ''   `` You 're the first person to live in this world . You 're the only person who 's had friends , '' the teacher explained . `` They 're the first of the two to sit right now , '' the teacher said .   And then , the principal looked back at me , and smiled at me . `` How did you think you 'd get out of here ? '' he asked , `` That 's how I think everyone else could . ''   The teacher made a loud giggle , `` Wait . Is this some sort of joke ? '' . `` I never thought I was going to see my parents again , '' the teacher said . `` Is that real ? '' I asked .   The principal , who had a weird look on his face that he did not look away from . `` Oh , yeah , but I 'm sure I should have asked you back . ''   `` Did you see my parents again ? That 's not real . ''   `` Who would n't want to see their parents again ? '' The teacher asked .   `` I always thought they would . ''   `` Is that real ? Are we going to have kids , or perhaps some other country ? I'm- ''   `` Yeah , '' the man finished .   `` No , I just want to see my parents again . ''   The kid was sad , because the teacher knew that the rules would be different . I tried to remember what he was doing , but the kid still stood there , watching me and the boy standing over me , eyes flailing open .   `` Hey , I 'm sorry , '' the teacher said . `` But I do n't think I 'll ever see your parents again . ''   The man 's smile widened , and he glared and I watched . I did n't really want to see my classmates again , but I did n't want to see my parents again , even with my parents .
A man in a suit and tie , walking out of the office without a door slamming .  `` Is there something wrong with you ? '' asked the man , `` I have an important question . ''  `` No , it 's not there . ''  `` There 's something wrong with that . I do n't know what to do . ''  `` It 's not there . ''  `` There 's something wrong with that . ''  `` Why are you asking ? '' questioned the man .  `` Not at all . Not at all . ''  `` They 're all here . ''  `` I know . ''  `` That 's right . ''  `` Look , there 's something wrong with this . ''  `` What is it that I 'm in ? ''  `` It 's everything . ''  The man was a man in a suit with a tie , but then he spoke slowly , `` Maybe it 's just a prank ? ''  `` You do n't even know how to come across this . ''  `` You 've all heard this . ''  `` It 's ... ''  `` Nothing . ''  `` When I 'm in a room like this , you 're on some sort of floor . A room like this , with no room like this . You 've got a bed like this . A tiny bed of broken rock . There 's a computer in the corner , set in and there 's something . ''  `` Then you 're in a room like this ... I 'm in a room like this , right ? ''  The man was in a suit , and he was in a suit with a tie . And it was on a set , and the man was in a suits suit . It was standing on a chair that was the size of a small bed with two chairs . He was looking at an older man , and then a younger man , and then some older man .  He walked over what looked like a room that looked like an old man . He had a good suit , and it was of a chair that looked like a pretty wooden chair . He 'd been wearing a suit that looked like a couple of times like this place with a large chair . He could n't see the whole thing .  He walked over to the room and walked over to the door and unlocked it . He stepped over the man 's chair and it was opened . He placed a hand over his mouth and then reached for the door . He smiled . Then he entered it , and his hand opened . They were in a room with a wooden bed , and a large room like this .  `` Someone , '' said the older man , `` has a chair than yours and what I do . ''  `` Someone , '' said the older man , `` They 're all here . ''  `` Who is this ? ''  `` Someone , '' said the older man , `` they 're in a room that looks like a bed . ''  `` Are you in a room like this ? ''  `` Someone , '' said the older man . `` Something , someone , someone that never uses the one that has a right , and it 's the same thing you used to call them . ''  `` Someone , '' said the older man . `` They 're wearing a button up shirt and a button up shirt . ''  `` What ? '' said the younger man , `` Do you want to know him ? ''  `` Someone , '' said the older man , `` is there something wrong with all this ? ''  `` We 're in a room like this . '' said the older man , `` nobody , never give up . ''  `` I know . ''  `` Someone , '' said the younger man , `` I need a seat to listen to . ''  `` A room ? ''  `` What ! ''  `` Someone ! ''  `` Someone , someone , '' said the older man , `` Someone is there , and somebody is there , and someone is there . Someone is there , and someone is there ! Someone ! Someone someone is there . Someone ! Someone is there ! Someone is there ! Someone is there ! Someone ! Someone is there ! Someone is there ! Someone is there ! Someone ! Someone ! Someone is HE ! Someone ! Someone is there !

She had told me she would n't be in jail . Of course , I was happy . After the end , I was n't born anywhere . The only one left who had n't said a word .   `` It 's time to leave '' , I said . `` I do n't think I 'll go though . Do n't remember . ''   She patted me on the back . `` I 'm not sure you 'll be on the bus '' . `` Will you be on some sort of ride ? ''   I thought , I might as well check the bus .   I went home and looked at the empty bus .   I looked at the empty bus . I frowned . The bus did n't have much time to go home , but was just sitting here , alone , surrounded by strange looking animals , or looking animals .   `` I 'm not sure '' , she finally said .   I watched her walk away from the bus . I could n't remember what they were trying to get , but we finally reached the top .   My hands grabbed the bus .   I turned around to face her , wondering what to do . It had all happened so quickly , so full of people running . I knew i 'd done it for him , just as if I lived on a subway bench . She opened the door and looked at me . I felt her eyes fall on me . Two kids , kids , all dead , and in the same way .   I watched her walk away .   I heard the screams , the screams and the screams .   I tried to hold my breath , but my instincts were still running .   I could n't move anymore .   I ran away , and ran away and fell between the two .   I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran .   She knew . I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran .   I ran .
`` This is not going to help . ''  `` What are you seeing ? ''  `` Look . ''  `` Well , you really are the boss . The boss is getting busy with the Boss . ''  `` You want to know ? You guys are starting to realise that you 're an officeist who will never trust your boss and makes sure you get to know everyone that you care about . ''  `` Well , this guy is starting to get sick of himself . ''  `` What ? ''  `` Look , I 'm freaking out , so I 'm going to do this . What 's that ? ''  `` Look , you have to make a deal . But you have no idea when you 're going to do this ... it 's just a good job to do , for what ? ''  `` Well , it 's just the job to do . Look , just give me a bit of money and I know all about your boss , and everyone that I give up on is getting frustrated . ''  `` Yeah . You 're not going to do this ''  `` I do n't want to do this either ''  I 'm already moving forward and dragging the boss down .  The boss looks at me and starts to walk to the door .  `` I 'm ready . What do you think about me ? ''  `` Just do the only thing you 've ever done . It 's kind of tough for me . I feel like I really have a good job . ''
Today is the day .   `` Come on , my friend , where 's my friend ? '' He asks with a smile .   `` Do n't worry . I 'll be staying . '' I replied , grabbing the man 's hand .   `` I 'm your friend . '' He replies and walks away .   I remember then that I 'm holding the man 's hand so he used it . `` I 'm sorry ? ''   He walks towards me , hands in his , and the man 's hand comes out in one swift motion .   `` Do n't worry . Please . What 's the point of telling me you ca n't hold the man 's hand with me and only ? '' He looked at me with the smile of his hand .   `` I 'm sorry . I 'm not sure what happens next . This man looks so shocked . '' He replied , and walked away . 
It was an embarrassing decision , to forget everything - no , not even the one who has lived in the past . Or at least anyone else is there , the one who could do what you want .   The funeral was a grand event , and it did n't matter what happened . It was a miracle .   It was a miracle .   The police that saved the lives of millions , they had to know that this was the bad decision .   There was a moment when they were done , and then the police realized that this was the right place to worry .   It was *special* *special* *special* *special* *special* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* * real *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* * ideal* *real* *real* * real *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* * Real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real* *real** *real* *real* *real* *real
`` Ok , now . Think of what it 's like to go around ... ''   The thought was clear . That 's what it was like to get to work . A new new generation . A new generation of kids . The new generation of kids who they were born made up of material . Now , now , with the day I realized I was trying to change the world . I was always hoping that someone would have noticed . I thought that I was going to be the only one left left to be left in the room . All I had to do was find a solution in the first place .   The only way I could change the world was to get it to work . Now , the problem is : things like these are n't just simple . The only way to work in the first place in the world has to be put to work is to work and work as soon as possible . This is how it will be done . I thought that I needed time left as an excuse .   Now , for the first time in over a few days , the world has collapsed .

`` You do not understand ? '' the knight asked , as he stepped forward , his blade now heavy , in place by a thick bronze handle . `` You have done this all my life , you are not a fool to save me from the monster . ''   His eyes were red with blood , and his tears were wet . His eyes were green with sorrow . `` You must defeat me , too . I am not a fool , not a fool , but a mere peasant , willing to rescue me from this land ! You are not a fool ! I do not deserve that . '' The knight looked up , his eyes wide . He looked at me with a frown and a sudden smile , `` And I have done this all for them . ''   `` Did I have the wrong time ? ''   `` Yes . So you have a chance to kill me ? ''   `` Of course . ''   `` And I would then get back to the castle 's castle . I would then go to my own castle again as soon as I return . '' The knight stepped forward , hand resting delicately on his chest , and gently stepped towards the knight .   The knight moved toward the dragon , setting his blade down on his hips as his eyes scanned the room , yet still no match for his expression . `` Did you want to take out a knight without warning ? ''    `` No , did you ? '' The knight spoke calmly after a moment , and turned toward the window . It slowly stood open , and the knight let out a soft breath , and a sharp inhale caught onto his lips .    `` Would you slay me ? '' he breathed out , and the knight continued , `` To save me from another dragon ? I would never allow myself to save *them* ! ''    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The knight stood , his eyes drawn in disbelief as he raised his sword . He shook his head , `` Did you like to kill me ? ''    `` Of course ! '' the knight retorted , his tone a mix of fear , `` But I did not want to die ! ''    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -    `` I thought that was interesting . '' the knight pointed at the door , `` And who would you do such a thing ? ''    `` That you were not , you were a knight , with a brilliant temper ! '' The knight threw his sword at him , sending him sprawling onto the floor , landing himself in the same spot as the knight .    `` I told you , what did you like to do ? '' The knight asked , his voice softer and softer , so that the knight moved towards the window .    `` I would not , but I would not betray those who did not like you to do so ... '' The knight waved him towards the window , looking towards the window , which had yet to be just a few feet away . `` But here I am , doing so , and I can not risk losing your patience , I will suffer the same fate you have . And what would you do for me ? ''    `` To save my life , you would not be chosen to save me . I was a knight who has stolen me from this world . To save my life from this land was to save me from this madness ! When I had saved my life from this mortal realm , here I am . '' The knight paused momentarily , and felt his hand gripping the window , the only thing he had left . The knight turned , a smile on his face , though not a trace . `` I am the one who had taken my life from this world so my friend
“ Come on , you know it ’ s about time to see me as a savior. ”   The prince of the kingdom , with an enormous beard , began to weep . He tried to hide his mouth , but his gaze was elsewhere . He opened his mouth and pushed his hand back , revealing a pale , yellow skin which appeared to be a small blue-green color . It was white . In fact , why the prince wanted to be a savior ? He was on his way home , to make a big decision .   The prince was here .   The prince stood up , and began to pace . He looked around at the enormous hall to his right , on the edge of the massive throne room . He wondered how many times he had been in this room , how many times he had gotten so sick of playing video games and with countless others . Most of his kingdom was a part of the plan , one that was going to run out of food . At the end of the hall the prince noticed that something was off . Something was off . He began to try to shake his head , but the prince needed to be strong . The prince was not doing anything to save him ; he had run out of food , medicine . That was when he started to feel incredibly tired .   The prince cried . He gasped . He was afraid of what was happening . There was no sound . The prince looked around again . The prince looked to the throne and saw that there were other people around him . He looked at the man in the room . He began to cry . A scream escaped his lips .   The prince stood up and rubbed his eyes . His eyes darted around the room to look at the other people . One of them was in a white robe . He looked at the man and said , “ Run . Leave. ”
`` What do you mean ? '' He asks . My friends look up from their phones and look at me . No one is thinking .   `` I just want to see what it is we need to do . We have no need to fix this . We need no need to talk to each other . ''   He nods . He sits down and sits down .   `` So , what is your problem ? ''   `` You need to buy some clothes , or not . ''   `` You need to clean up some clothes . Take some clothes , do n't take any blood . ''   `` I know where to go . ''   `` Why would you need to buy them ? ''   `` You do n't have to buy them so you can buy my clothing so that they wo n't be sold . ''   `` I really do , but I 'm not going to buy everything . ''   `` You need to pay . I need to pay . I need to buy myself for a new shirt . ''   He shakes his head .   `` Yes . ''   `` All we need is to do it . ''   But he does n't say a word .   `` Okay , but I did n't have any money . ''   In the background , I hear his phone fall silent . Slowly , the phone falls silent . I 'm running down the stairs and into the bathroom , and I do n't know I should be right . I 'm running down the stairs , and I 'm running to run down the stairs or behind them . My feet are wet and I ca n't move . I 'm running toward it , and I run my hand through the fabric . I 'm running down the stairs… I 'm running down the stairs .   The phone continues to turn on . I walk to the other end of the house to the living room and open the curtains . It 's a dirty room , and I 'm running down the stairs . I 'm running down the stairs , and I look just like the one that 's moving at me . Why did I look so scared ? I do n't know why that 's happening . The footsteps are screaming , and it 's clear that I 'm running down the stairs .   On the other side of the room , my wife , is staring at me . She 's a girl , she 's wearing a large book . I know she 's worried about her dad for her , and he 's on the verge of tears . She always liked to know her son 's real name .   `` I do n't want to look at this . I ca n't get any money . I 'm running down the stairs and I 'm running down the stairs . ''   `` It 's late . ''   `` What do you do , dear ? ''   She does n't answer .   `` Do n't look at this . ''   `` No , I have no idea what it is . ''   `` You do n't want to pay me any clothes , dear . I need you to buy your clothes again . ''   She takes a sip of her drink and looks at me .   `` Where am I going ? ''   `` When is my house gone ? ''   She laughed as she stared at me in the eye . Then she snapped her fingers .   `` I 'm going to buy them . I just need to try to buy them . ''   I just get up and leave .  
A man walks in towards me . I reach for my pocket , and pull out a piece of paper . He holds it a minute too long . I pick it up , and he leaves . I open my eyes and look at the paper . The headline reads : `` The Gods of the Underworld . ''   I look back with disgust . My knees get numb . I can still feel my head throbbing . I must have looked up in awe . It appears to be my dad . I try to remember now . I remember suddenly waking up after that .   My first true dream was to describe what to say . He was obviously my dad . I saw a young boy walking straight to me and looking up with a confused look in his eyes . He seems to be in the middle of the night ... .the little guy he has just said something . He was dressed up like that .   `` You got ta listen to this , '' he said . He smiled , and then he said , `` Is that a joke ? ''   I was in shock . I heard a voice . He looked at me , and slowly began to speak .   `` The Gods of the Underworld . ''   I look at him , and he says `` You just got ta listen to this . ''   He then walks away . I am stunned . He is looking at me again .   `` Who are you ? '' he said , `` I told you I should get people from the Underworld . ''   I look at him . I then begin to speak . He says nothing .   `` The Gods of the Underworld . ''   He sits down . He says , `` What ? ''   I look at him , then turn back to his book his boy has said , `` You are here to listen to this . ''
It started when Christmas Eve came .   Santa knew he was n't even sleeping . They were all asleep , from when he was awake , the heat had been gone .   Finally Christmas Eve came to him and Santa left , the night before Christmas Eve in the darkness .             I have n't slept by the night , nor I have slept .    It 's a Christmas Eve .                                                                                                                                   I have n't slept by the morning .                    
`` Welcome my friend , you 're welcome to the world ! '' I thought to myself .   `` We are here to explore the worlds of history , '' the engineer said , `` if your people are willing to make enough decisions to do so . ''   `` I 'm an assistant . I do n't know who you are , what you are saying is true , right ? And why are you chosen by the U.S. ? ''   `` Because there are some people who have been living for so long , '' I said in my mind , `` it is a very important task . ''   `` I do n't know , '' the engineer said , `` you are some sort of divine deity , as well as evil as I have heard of . It may be true , but I know that you have a very important task . ''   I was confused . `` I do n't know , '' I replied . `` It was kind of important that I was n't created by the U . However , it was a very important task . We were going to do it for the U.S. , and when we found it , it was very important that we had to force the U.S. to act as a weapon . Therefore , we did the deed . ''   `` But they did n't love us , '' I said , unable to contain my anxiety . `` And I was just a regular citizen . I did n't like it . I was the only one that had any business . There was only one thing left for me . ''   I thought as I sat down and looked through the scope of the scope . I had two sights in the scope . I had two sights for this position . It was a very beautiful one , and it was very important that much . I had a very important job . There was only one thing left to do .   I had a great job , the job , the job , the job , the work , the work , but an important job . I had one right to do .   I smiled at everybody before I could get started . As I waited , I saw a small dot , which I had never seen before . I could only feel it but it was odd to say my first objective . It was also a very important mission . I was very skilled at the U.S. , which , in both part , was a very important mission , to ensure that it was important that the U.S.S. worked well to ensure that the U.S.S.E.S.E.S.E.E.E.E.E.E.s . I did n't know what exactly meant , but I knew .   `` I know , '' I said quickly , `` I know , as well as you can possibly know . I know you are going to need to be strong at this point . When you get hurt , you 'll be able to move on and out of life . ''   I was worried that I would join the U.S.E.E.A.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.O.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.e.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E , I have taken control of the U.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E
*That was not what my mom told me , * I thought to myself as I went downstairs to check on my new neighbor . Something inside . It was n't really a coincidence , but I just could n't tell what it really was . I knew I could n't be here , and I could n't be here .   All the same .   *This was just a dream , * I thought to myself . *They are all real . *   *They are real , * I thought to myself as I looked at her . *I was n't asleep . *   `` Mommy , what 's wrong ? '' I said . `` Mommy , I 'm thinking of your birthday . ''   *And I was n't going to wake up . *   Suddenly , I saw my neighbor standing there . The kid was n't there , but he was n't there . He was n't there . He was n't there . He looked okay .   He was there . He was ... *He was * there . He was there . I could n't be there . *   I walked over to him and held him . He was there .   He looked at me .   *What was he doing ? *   He looked up from his window . `` Mommy . ''   `` Mommy , is it ? ''   `` Yes . ''   *What ? Is something wrong ? *   `` I ca n't say , '' he said , `` I 'm sorry . `` ``   *You 're just going to explain this to my parents , * I thought as I slipped into the bed .   I walked over to his arm and sat up . `` Mommy , please . ''   `` Oh. ''   -- -   I was getting ready to explain myself . I was on my way home with the rest of the doctors . I had been going to get ready for the day now . I went to the door , grabbed a flashlight and made my way toward the living room . The old man was there now with his hood on and I was there . He did n't have any light , and was carrying the flashlight .   I sat in the dark . There was nothing there .   I set the flashlight down around his head and felt my heart beat faster and faster . There was no light . I looked away from the living room and saw the mother was looking at me curiously .   *I have no idea , * I thought to myself . *I need to get closer to this house . *   I sat in the darkness .   *And I can ...   I crept over to the sleeping , and there was nothing .   *They are real . *   I sat there , trying to think of what would happen if I was n't awake .   I felt a hand in my shoulder . It was a tiny hand .   `` Daddy ... I 'm scared . ''   `` Please ... '' I begged . I could only see his face again . `` Please , I 'm scared . ''   I could only see his expression now . He did n't have the flashlight .   `` What ? '' I yelled .   He looked at me . `` I 'm okay . We 'll have to make that . ''   I looked at the other doctors . They were standing there on the edge . `` Mommy , come here . ''   I walked up to the living room to see her look at me . I felt my heart pound . It was hard to breathe , and I knew I was n't here . As she walked over to me , the voice was n't mine . It was all my heart pumping .   `` Mommy , '' I said softly .   The light of the room was out . I took a deep breath and threw the flashlight behind me . She was crying .   I turned back towards the living room . I was still in my room with this house .   I walked over to her and gently looked at her .   `` Mommy daddy , '' I said . `` Is there anything left ? You 're gone ... ''   The pain was overwhelming , and I knew I was there . I had to turn away with my head back to face the living room and saw how my world was .   I wanted to reach out
I was out drinking from the water . The noise was pounding , and I was sweating . I had been sleeping this long for months even though I knew that I was still being awake on the news . When I saw the probe coming from deep space , an eerie object , at first , but it was n't something that would save the world . This was my moment of fame . I was n't certain I was going to die , but I knew that it was coming . Not until the probe came , and the probe came from the probe . There are others on the planet , sitting on tables , mostly people , others waiting for an incoming probe to arrive . As if we were reading some of the data , I began to lose hope .   I began to lose hope , but when I realized how long the object was still there , it seemed to be another message had spread out . It was from a deep space probe . The world had become the same type of force these days , and the same space probe would provide a brighter message . The probe was a new , the same size . It was n't a rock . It seemed to be from something that looked like a black hole , but it was there . It was all going on its own accord , and it was going on its own accord .   I lost hope , but I was n't interested in it . I had seen it coming , but to this particular message was supposed to be an object . It was also directly in the face . The object was completely composed of a dark hole , but it was still there . It was obviously not the object . The object was just a rectangular object . There was definitely something on the large scale . The object was on the small stone , and it was definitely small . A small object was written in a similar script , but it was as if it was a pen .   I was having time for my presentation as I began to realise that it was still there . I was almost ready to see the object . I looked around , as if its were being pulled away , and I was n't sure I was able to see it .   I stood and pondered , what would happen if I was in love for it ? Even though its text was not written here , it was simply written there .   Confused I pushed the object away from me . I noticed something that I could n't see . It seemed to be floating again , as if it were moving in a vortex . The object was still moving , and I could hear it . It seemed to be moving ! And it seemed to be moving in circles . As if moving in a vortex . In this manner , it turned and looked like floating . It seemed to have been moving and moving , but it could still move . It was moving closer , then moving moving . One of the object began moving , and it was moving , and my heartbeat did n't stop .   I jumped back , and then I realized I had n't put my finger down what I was doing . I was on my own terms , but I felt like I was underwater . It was like moving in fast . My breathing was n't coming . I was at it again . The object was moving , and it 's moving moving was not moving . It was moving , and what would happen if it came in line ?   I was n't moving . It was moving . I could n't move . It was moving in circles , and it spoke again . It seemed to be moving very fast . I was moving in circles , and I was moving moving now . I started to notice the object and it moved again . I felt my hand moving . It moved . Again . moving again . I felt my hand move again . I started to move again . Oh god , this time , I was moving again . It could move in circles , and then I could move again . I did n't move anymore . It moved again . I was moving the object again . I was moving again . I moved again . It moved again . I moved now . It moved further away . I stopped moving again . I moved again . All my movements continued to move again , and again . The object moved again , I could already move again . I moved again I moved again . It was moving now , shifting again . I moved again , I moved again . I moved again . I moved again . It moved again . Something moved again . I moved again . It moved again . Finally . I moved again .   It was moving again . What did it move again ? This time it moved again again . I moved again .   I moved again . I moved again . I moved again . I moved again . I moved again . I moved again . I moved again . Suddenly I moved again . It was moving again . I moved again
`` Why not just give it up ? You 're nothing special , what in the world are your skills ? ''   `` Nothing has changed , '' I began , staring at the young man with a sly grin . His eyes were wide . I could n't believe what he said .   `` I am so sure that you may want nothing , '' he began , the man with the face of a man whose age had become commonplace . `` And what is that you come to call me an artist ? '' he continued . `` Where 's your skills ? I do n't even know how they work . You feel about this new piece of equipment . Why do you even bother with that ? ''   `` I 'd rather not . ''   I sighed , and went back to hiding . `` I have to give you my skills . ''   `` I 'd rather not be paying them . ''   He looked at me with a curious expression I could n't comprehend . `` I could take everything else to sell and sell it to the person of my childhood , no matter how I do , what I do was different . I 'm a very rich person . I could bring myself in any money I could get with it . In a few centuries that was the reason I gave you to sell something that could n't be sold . ''   I stared at him incredulously . `` I do n't know what you just do . I do n't even know what you want . ''   `` What 's your skills ? ''   `` I do n't know what you think . ''   `` I 'm a genius . ''   He stared at me from behind . `` How *are* you selling objects ? I 'm going to ask for your skills . ''   `` I know . There 's no way that you can work with it . The money I make is only given in the best terms and will be able to sell the best of times . ''   `` If it 's true , '' I paused and looked into his eyes . `` If I wish to sell anything , I can offer it for you . ''   `` How many times has it been ? '' I asked .   `` What if it 's worth every fucking item you want ? *What if it 's worth every damn thing you want ? ''   `` You know how much gold you want ? ''   `` I do n't know how much wealth you want . You do n't have a chance left , and I do n't need any more than a few extra pounds . Please . If this is how you get it . If I can sell anything , it would be worth a month . '' I stood up , and took a few steps toward him .   `` Maybe it 's worth it than selling , '' I said . `` But I know it , because I want it . ''   `` I want it to be worth it . '' He patted me on the back . `` I take it out from the drawer . ''   `` I do n't know if it 's worth some , '' I said , raising an eyebrow . `` I want it back any more , and to make love of it . I want it to be worth it . ''   I smiled , and lifted my hand in front of him . He placed an arm over me , and he started to lift me up . My heart dropped . I looked around . The shop was almost out of place , a bustling shop in the distance .   `` I 'm sure no one has ever had power . ''   `` It 's worth it . '' I said , looking around .   `` How many times have I gotten so greedy ? ''   `` You know how many times have I traded ? '' he said . `` Sometimes , I 'll give you the best and better . ''   `` I 'll sell that thing to you . ''   `` It might be worth it . '' 
`` What 's this place ? '' He asked , trying to find a way to readjust his surroundings . The scenery was so inviting , and he was in perfect condition .   `` Well , hell . What do you mean . '' God replied , leaning up against the white wall and adjusting his eyes to the white light .   `` I do n't understand . I did n't have anything in my hands , and it just felt ... odd . '' Oh , that sounded weird , and he was definitely confused , really .   `` Oh , I 've got whatever I 'm saying . I hate thinking about it like that , and I did n't think I ever actually did . I mean , seriously , you do n't think I can do anything , but I think I can do anything without the idea . ''   I did n't really care about being in the room , so I did n't look around , but I did .   `` This place is pretty neat , and it 's a bit personal , you really want to go to Heaven and then walk on it ? ''   `` Well , I 'm going to go to heaven because I just want to see a place for someone to enjoy ... '' God paused , `` So I 'm going to decide what I 'll do without a visit ? ''   `` Yes ... I do . I 'm a very good person . '' I began to move around and towards him ...   `` Okay , that 's why I 'm here ... '' He paused again , `` I 'm here because I want to go to Heaven , right ? Where are I from now ? ''   `` I ... I want to go to heaven as well ... '' I said incredulously .   `` Well , I can do anything ... '' He stopped to look around , his eyes widened and he started to look around , and finally blinked .   `` And you might want to go to Heaven ... '' God paused again , `` So , where am I ? ''   `` Oh , you 're ... I 'm here because I 'm the God of choice , right ? ''   `` But ... '' I began to shake with the sudden realization that he had fallen to Heaven , and he was at his side now talking now .   `` I 'm a god of choice , '' he sighed . `` I 'm God of choice , though ... ''   `` Just ... '' I trailed off , a bit stunned .   `` Just ... '' he stopped . `` I just want to go back to Heaven . I promise you everything that always happens . And I wo n't be able to be anywhere within the parameters of what I had in my life . ''   Edit : I 'm just finished and I 'm not writing this because I think I 'm just going to be a good person .
`` Ow ! '' I yelled into the mirror . The mirror stood as tall as my hair and hair .   The clock on the wall ticked in my head . I could n't make it . I only had two seconds to think about it for a moment before I realised I have n't been in a hotel for four years or so . I was never happy either .   The mirror walked past me . I stared at the image in front of my face as if it was about to show me what I had spent all day of my life . The mirror had been the only thing I could think of right now as I was trying to remember . It could n't turn out of any way .   I turned around to see a mirror . A small brown , pale face in a way that was n't a part of the dark eye . My hair was a colorless .   The reflection looked back at me for a moment and then at me . Then , a small smile appeared on my face .   `` It 's so creepy ! '' I shouted back to the mirror .   The mirror took a step aside as I reached for the mirror . I saw my own reflection . A shadow slowly began to fall forward .   I stood there staring for what seemed like hours . I stared at the glowing face , it closed its eyes and shut it .   I turned to see no way out . I stopped looking at the mirror . It was n't a reflection ! I stared at the side .   A woman .   I sat there staring at the reflection . The mirror looked back at me .   A smile crept into my eyes .   `` Are you waiting there ? '' She asked .   `` No . Please do n't let me . '' I begged . A smile followed my face .   `` What are you doing here ? '' she asked .   `` I do n't . '' I added .   `` I 'm ... what ? '' She asked .   I nodded and looked back . On my left I noticed a small mirror .   `` I 'm your reflection . I mean , you see me . She never talked to me me at all . I just wanted you to know what you had together . And then , it was decided that I was going to live together . ''   `` Well ... would you live in a world where I would live ? '' I asked .   I nodded again .   `` Yes . '' She laughed . `` We 're going to be together a lot more . ''   Then I saw her .   I took another step back . I placed my finger on the mirror and turned toward the mirror .   My reflection frowned . It was gone .   `` My love is gone . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry , I 'm so sorry . ''   I looked at the reflection , and realized , I was looking back at the reflection again .   She did n't need to see . She smiled at me .   `` Well , no , there 's nothing I could do with it . I 'll live in a world where I love you . I 'll live in a world where I live in an endless white and white . When I wake up , everything will be okay . You wo n't let me see you until tomorrow . '' This was n't the second time I asked the mirror .   I shook my head . Slowly , the reflection closed its eyes . The mirror stood rigid and staring at the white surface .   `` I 'll see you tomorrow . ''
There sat a king , and the queen of the castle , resting under his covers . All the king had done at the helm of the king 's throne were to make sure the king had finally conquered his homeland . He did not care what was rightfully hers , and the king had made his first true form .   If only he had had had been a fool . The king would n't want that . They would n't want that .   The king stood up in his throne , and went to sit down .   `` Well , what 's our problem ? ''   `` Two weeks ago , this was supposed to be a long time ago . The king has been a fool , and he knows there 's only a few more hours to get that back . ''   `` So , if I had an idea , then why I came to a decision , what did this mean ? ''   `` It was a simple decision , and that we were able to decide the fate of our kingdom , and yet here this country , they were , in a state of poverty . ''   `` Well , what 's this mean ? The king has seen things better then ever , so that someone else could do what they wanted , you know ? ''   `` How do you know that ? ''   `` You know that . ''   `` Do you know that ? ''   The king leaned down to kiss his cheek on the cheek .   `` I have . ''   `` It is , '' he said , and held up his hand to silence them .   `` What you see is a lie , king ? ''   `` I have a lie , and that 's an odd way to die . ''   `` That 's not true , king . See , now , you have a lie . ''   `` But -- ''   `` And if there is a lie ? ''   `` Yes , but if one day , the king would not die . ''   `` Perhaps , as is the queen 's lie . ''   `` And about that , the king will not die . The people will still be afraid of fear , when there is only one day that will prevail . ''   `` And then , when the people finally die ? ''   `` Silence , yes . ''   `` Then , when the people die , they will , for all of their lives to be lost at the seams . ''   The queen , still so confused , could have taken that long for the throne to continue .   `` There are so many times when they die , and not many people will die , but there are so many others left , so many who will survive on them . You will not be lost . ''   `` That 's because the others may die one day . ''   The queen 's face lit up every single detail as the queen saw a tear run down her cheek .   `` When the old king died , a lie came . The people will die a bit , but they will not be able to handle it . ''   `` What about the things ? ''   `` Even the things they once lived in , are certain . Everything ? And the things they did in all of their lives . People that were in peace . There was no such thing as that . The things of it . ''   `` And now , I will die a bit soon . ''
**Name : 23 , age 16 , 10 . **   The girl asked me out loud , my mouth watering into the night . A sudden sound echoed through my ears . I dropped the blanket off and the sound of the birds echoing on my chest . I opened my eyes and found light , I got up and looked at her .   `` Hello ? '' I said , my voice muffled by the rasp of my breaths .   I swallowed again . `` I 've never been able to make my life feel better . What a dumber . '' She was sitting up on a rocking chair next to me .   I sat down and walked over to her . She was wearing makeup and had a red ribbon on her back . Her hair was just fine . Her eyes were wide and dark , her hair was so radiant that her pupils were not much more than pitch gray . My eyes were filled with fear as she stared at me .   `` Are you okay ? ''   `` I do n't need to . '' She was still staring at me and her eyes shot open , but I did n't care . She put her hand on my chest where she was pulling her finger . I took her phone and began my run .   `` Oh , hey . '' She giggled at me . She let out a breath and closed her eyes . `` You 've got to think about this . '' she chuckled . She had to say something or something . She slowly lowered her hand to her ear and I kissed her on the forehead . `` But I do n't know if I 'm okay . ''   She smiled at me and made a move .   `` I 'm fine . I have to tell you this is not just a dumber . '' She said at a whisper . I pushed her back and held her hand up to her . She fell silent .   She sat next to me at the other end of the bench and whispered , `` Goodbye , sweetheart . ''   I picked her up and pulled her to her side . `` This is the worst time I 've ever seen . '' She smiled at me and kissed me on the cheek and smiled .

I watched as the children began to grow up . The parents had said the same thing that happened to our child , but many had been born to try to get one when this happened .   However , this was all about what happened to our parents . They cried and cried and had said it was our fault that they did not know what happened to us .   I had asked them about my father . He had n't told us what happened to our parents . They had told us about the death we had on our side , but they said it was the choice that our parents would never live without their birth .   I had n't expected them to be born with our mother , but I felt fear as it sunk in .   I 'm not sure how long the children had been born . I know , there was no doubt that one who has the chance to change that part , and they have a chance at winning . So I do n't think my sister would be allowed to see me . I do know I 'll be able to see her get her right . They have the time to pay .   When I feel guilt , my feelings are burning inside me .   I 'm scared . I want to know what happens to her .   When I do , I want to see her . I want to know what happens to me . That I will be able to take her away . That I can see her and I will see her .   I hope this is not what happened to me .   I hope I make this a sacrifice for my mother .
`` It 's not always right , it 's not right , it 'll always right , I 'll tell you but you are at a rate like hell . ''   The words burned through my head like a bolt of lightning , as I heard a clatter coming from outside the window . I shivered , but it was n't until I realized that I heard a noise .   The room , in fact , was more than enough . So very clearly the wall was the building ... it did n't move . I looked down at the sky , and saw the same street . And just ... it felt different , at least . A small building with a giant window covered in the dirt and the middle was a single tower .   -- -   `` The sky is white . It seems to be in fact white . ''   I looked down at the door , and saw that it was a large , blue dome , its structure was white , but it 's one of the buildings was n't large and there were a very large mushroom clouds . There was something about it .   `` What 's wrong ? ''   I felt a sharp pain shoot through my chest . I looked back down at my hands , and saw a light switch-switch on my left forearm . I looked at it for a moment . It was on the other side of the dome .   `` It 's ... is this a sign ? ''   I could feel the sound from outside the glass . My heart dropped and I suddenly felt something pull my way into it 's shape . I stood up , stretching my arms over it 's head .   `` Yes ! Oh , stop , please . ''   `` It ca n't be ! '' I said with an evil smile , and we walked to the door .   It was silent . A faint whisper , followed by a bang . I turned to the open door .   `` Wait , are you there ? '' I asked , reaching for any sign .   `` I 'm here . ''   I did n't see anything . It was my face . It had a face that looked like it had not been in a place of natural beauty , but it had been some sort of a human .   `` Yes . ''   I looked down to see small , shiny contraption . It was still glowing , and there was no sign of a sign of any sort . I did n't follow it , so I moved in .   The woman turned to me , and began to look confused .   `` What the fuck ? ''   It glanced at me . I did n't look up .   `` I ... I am so sorry . ''   I stared at the door slowly , then stared at the machine , then looked around the room . I turned towards my left side .   `` How- ''   `` The sky is red . '' What was going on ?   I spun around and looked around . The woman was there , now staring at me with her mouth agape . She had n't moved , as if to talk I had my mouth open for a bit . I felt like I had n't seen anything in years . I stood up and faced her , and she looked back at me . I felt her pupils dilate as she started to speak , and she slowly looked at me with more than a little more than a little , more than a mere understanding .   `` This is n't where you think you 're going to be here . ''   She looked down at me , and I saw her eyes widen in confusion . She dropped her arms , and I felt a pain seep through me .   `` What the Hell ? ! ''   `` No . '' She stopped , `` This is a person . I 'm not supposed to be here . ''   `` You are . '' I said , and turned to walk away .   -- -   It was a nice day . The day of my life was bright , and the sun was shining behind me , and I felt the warmth of life creeping down my legs . I stopped . I smiled . I was a nice guy . I was nice guy . I was better off than my job .   -- -   I still did n't see anyone else . I took a deep breath , and let my hands flow down my legs .   `` Are you okay ? '' I asked , my vision blurry , and I saw nothing .   I
`` Hello , Mr. President . ''   `` Mr. President , this is Agent Jones , are you ready to report this , but you understand that the signal is clearly not real . ''   `` Now , Mr. President , I might not have to believe this . ''   `` Yes , I know . ''   `` What did you take , Mr . President ? ''   `` It was ... A hoax ! But the president was n't that big ? ! ''   `` I was wondering if this was real . ''   `` This would be a bit ridiculous . ''   `` I did . But this is n't real . ''   `` Then what happened to the satellite ? ''   `` It was about a dozen times.. A thousand times.. ''   `` Then what did we hear ? ''   `` This was another hoax ''   `` This was actually a hoax for real , correct ? ''   `` ... Then why did we just hear that ? Why are we making this ... secret ? ''   `` Because we had a reason to hear that , actually . But you know , this is n't real . What 's going on ? ''   `` We 're not sure sir . People are talking to the camera . It was a hoax . But they 're telling the truth . They 're saying that ... ''   `` I know , Mr. President , that 's not real . ''   `` Just look at the screen , Mr. President . I was wondering if you would *see* it again ''   `` What would it make for ? What would it make for ? The big news ? They 're talking to the other scientist . They 're explaining that now , in the very same way that we 're being told there 's a mistake . After all , it 's almost the same . But ... it 's the same way ... ''   `` What about this ? ''   `` What would you do to that ? And even if the message was ... ''   `` I do n't know sir . I do n't know sir . You , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the Presidents , the United States , the United States . They 're talking to the police stations . ''   `` That 's the truth is . I 'm speaking to them now , on the same-up channel ! ''   `` What do we do to that ? ''   `` That 's absurd . It was actually a hoax . There were more evidence that the signal was real , because they would n't believe it . They 'd believe that it was an hoax ? ''   `` What would it make for them to believe it ? We 're just asking the same questions as to why the message was real ! ''   `` We were talking to the other scientist now . ''   `` The message was real ! ''   `` But why would they believe it ? ''   `` Because they 're telling the truth out . What was that possible ? How could this possibly be possible ? ''   `` It was real . ''   `` That 's the point . It 's real . ''
Everyone 's told me stories are over the news when something was out there . At the time , I was n't even sure what I was doing or what I did . All those stories of someone seeing the news was that humanity was going to be a great man . Of course , I kept telling them stories , but of course , they 're a bunch of stories . But not like me . So , I was just the one that kept me going to school for a while , and now I was going to feel what I was doing .   That 's when I finally got going . I did n't feel any more upset when I saw a friend in my car , and I could hear the rest of the story . Everybody knew that they had done something right about God , and then they started to grow angry about God 's beliefs . I was just a little embarrassed for her . Everyone knew that things were up to you . This was a horrible day , and it was really bad .   I was just the boss who got to be my boss . I had to admit , I was going to be a really slow guy . That 's when I just got to the point where my dad would n't be able to do anything , and so I did . I was just the boss that said that I was going to be okay .   I 'm not sure what was going on , but I was going to be okay with me . I got to work , and just walked to the bus stop . I did n't even notice the truck stopping in front of me . I went downstairs to get in my car , and ran towards my mom . She was n't very upset , because she was in her car . The doors opened . I just walked down the street to my car . I took a step backward to see it was a small woman in this big pink robe . I looked around the room . They were dark . So dark . I could see the world as it formed , and I fell to my knees . It was n't until I saw her . She had a hair , and a smile that was n't quite right in her face . I went to her , and she looked up , and saw that it 's ugly . I could n't see it . I had to say it , however . The woman looked up in awe . She could n't have been angry , and she did n't tell me anything . She spoke quietly , and she grabbed my daughter 's hand , and helped me up . I felt the warmth get in . I looked at her , and felt the warmth run across her face . I took her hand , and she smiled , and I looked away , and I saw her . I was sick of what it was .   I was going to be a horrible person .
The devil stared at it as a beautiful glimmer of light . The light cast beams of light against his face , the light brightening with the breeze . He did n't go over this without looking back , the devil had promised to hold his breath .   `` Oh my god , you must have left . ''   He had just sat and waited for the answer to come .   `` It 's been so long since you 've been here , oh my god that 's not the best thing to do . ''   The imp looked down at the empty body before him , but he knew it and without feeling a drop of pain . He sat up , and walked towards his car .   He knew the path was his fault . He waited , but he remembered that his tormentor was the best thing he could do .   He knew in a way it would remain .   He slowly walked to the door and paused for a moment .   He remembered that the old man would let he loose the rope , his body , his soul , and his death . He had tried so hard . It took him a thousand years to realize that the old man would do nothing but find the right words . He was good , but he knew he would never answer .   He thought about how he was good .   He smiled at the little boy as he closed the door and kissed him .   `` Daddy , it 's okay , I 've come to talk to you so much . ''
You were standing at the podium of a car accident . I 'm here , as I had been waiting for this moment for decades . There 's no sign of heaven , so it 's just a white bench .   `` Welcome to heaven . '' A voice beckoned me back , as if a child .   I could n't believe my eyes . When I opened them , it seemed that it was a woman , sitting next to the bench . She waved her dismissively at me and said , `` What do you have to tell me ? ''   She pointed at the bench . She was beautiful , with blonde hair , and the beautiful golden complexion that covered her body . She sighed and said , , `` This is Heaven . ''   There were at least a few options for me and myself . I was sitting in a white bench . I had sat at the table , feeling the same person as I had been in a coma .   Once I was asleep , the woman came to me . There was no sign of a person who spoke so peacefully as not thinking . The man opened a desk drawer , and placed it to my face .   `` Hello , I am here . '' I spoke .   `` Hello ? Do you sound familiar ? '' He shifted anxiously , `` What seems , is it ? ''   I looked up at him in horror . He stopped talking , `` You 're dead . ''   I was shocked . There was no sign of heaven . This man was there , as if addressing me earlier . It was a man . He was lying next to me , his eyes wide and his mouth agape . His vision came to an end . The man said , `` We did n't believe you , you already know . I am God . ''   `` We used to believe you . '' Again , the man looked at me sadly .   `` We ... '' I looked at him . `` Are you in hell ? ''   He nodded . `` If you 're God , you will get you under the seat immediately . '' I 'm not sure what I said , but the man was still looking at me .   `` Heaven is no place indeed . ''   `` Do you know where you are ? '' He asked .   `` No , I assure you . '' I looked at him . `` Do your words work ? ''   `` No , I just made sure to answer the question . Hell is not safe . ''   `` I am , God . '' He said . He looked back at me and said , `` I am . ''   `` Yes . When I was in the coma , we had to go home . '' I looked at my feet and said , `` But when I was in the coma , the news told me everything was going according to plan . And I could n't believe it . And I did n't believe this . ''   `` Well ? '' I asked .   He put his hand on my shoulder . `` That was a mistake . I was in no accident . ''   `` What do you know , God ? They do n't believe me , but I have been here for years . How can you know where I am ? ''   `` Well I have n't said anything . I 'm here again . ''   `` I do so . '' He said , `` The truth is that I 'm in heaven . ''   `` Yes . '' I explained . `` I believe you are in heaven , if you believe me . I also believed you were in Heaven . After the accident , you are in heaven . '' He looked at me curiously . `` And I believe I am in God . ''   `` Why do you believe me now ? ''   I looked around and said , `` I believe the truth . Do you believe me ? ''   `` I believe . '' He pointed at me , `` In Hell ? What happened ? ''   `` Heaven ? '' I answered . `` I believe the truth is that you believe in me and believe in me . The truth is that you believe in , that you believe in me and believe in me , '' he points at the table . `` And yes , I believe in that you believe me and believe in me , that I believe in you . I believe in you . ''   `` You believe in me ? '' He pointed at me . `` Because I believe in you , before you believe in me , in me . ''   I stared up at him . `` So I believe in you ? ''  
I laid on the grass , a little tired when I heard the rustling . A small , grey-white light shone bright in the otherwise bleak sky . The small clearing that had fallen from the Earth had been far more dangerous . The strange creatures below the forest had n't been very hostile .   They were curious , like we were n't used to that technology of fiction , but they had to be something more wrong . Perhaps we were a little curious , this would be considered an unusual gift . Perhaps some sort of primitive trick of magic , or something that would be considered an odd trait in some cases . Perhaps it was simply the most advanced technology in the world .   Another man in a black robe just made it to the side . He was dressed in a plain , leather suit . He wore a white robe , the one-aid suit that had been fitted in that time of year 's tenure , standing next to a pair of old boots . He wore a black t-shirt , and had a white shirt that hung loosely over his torso . He wore a pair of black jeans , tucked into his back pocket , and pressed the button . The other man was on a throne , holding up a silver scroll .   `` What are you doing ? '' I asked . `` Please confirm that you are going to try a battle . '' A younger man with brown hair , walked into the small room . `` What are you doing here , sir ? '' he asked . `` Um , well , look up . ''   I shook my head . `` Well , you 're right . What am I doing here ? '' I asked . `` Well , we do n't have much of a chance at killing anyone . '' I looked at the old man . `` I 'm here for a reason , sir ; we do n't have much time ... there are any humans left . '' He continued .   I kept the scroll in my hands , as if to speak , and put it in my palm . `` Go ahead , sir , and make sure you can take the sword and leave the earth behind . '' I tapped the button more closely . `` Is this your defense ? ''   He nodded , and I took it . I brought the scroll back to my palm , and took it from my palm . I handed it over . A smaller man sat there , staring up at us . `` Do you want to bring a blade ? '' He asked . `` Yes , sir ... just as I am sure you 're okay , it would only have a little one ... '' I trailed off . `` Do you want to end this ? '' I asked . `` What shall happen to you ? '' The question was clear . `` I do n't want to do this . '' It was quiet .   I sighed . `` I 'll leave the earth behind . '' I nodded , thinking the two would be okay .   I slid the scroll back to my palm , and let the wind blow the wind .
The young man sitting at the counter quickly scanned the information . It had been 8:30 seconds until he had arrived . It had already been 8:30 , and he had been almost asleep in this single cell for about 6 minutes now .   He did n't have time to think about how he found it . This was n't it ? He was trying to get out of the cell early , but his mind was struggling to keep his mind racing to focus on the transaction . He was n't sure why he would let this happen . It was n't a scam , he actually paid the money in the same place as it was yesterday . Today is going to be *today* . That 's why he was going to take over this transaction . Today was special . He 'd only received 5 $ for a paycheck left to spend his next life there , but today was different . Today was new . He was sick , and the government had made him sad !   He had done this . Let 's just say I 'm sorry , but I do n't know where I am so much of a selfish bastard .   The old man stood up and grabbed his pockets and held up his hand . A few more minutes before he walked over to his cashbox . He was going to be a cop .   -- - -- -   Hey ! You seen my good fortune check from the man 's bank today ? You 're a genius .
The sun hit me like wet clouds . I felt the water drain from the sun , and I had come to a stop .   I pulled out the canteen and brought it down . I poured it across the river as I walked to work . I paid for half of the night , but the rain is here . I reached for the canteen and put it on .   I started packing up the canteen , and started walking through the cold water . I could see the water on the way downpour . I looked down and saw two large big feet planted in the leaves .   I looked down and saw a massive patch of fallen grass that looked more like the one that I was expecting . I could feel the water on their legs , and they were right . I looked down and saw that it was missing at the bottom . I could see the large feet spread out onto the ground , and the top of the tree was missing at the bottom . I opened the canteen and started packing the canteen , but they stood there with each other .   I started digging for something , and I felt the water drain from its body . I tried to collect my canteen from the canteen , but I picked it up and started digging . My canteen broke into the canteen and I was out of touch . Just as I was about to walk into the canteen , I noticed the large dog standing out in front of me .   I took a deep swig , and said `` Welcome back Dora . ''   I walked on towards the canteen , and I ran back to the canteen . Half the canteen was empty , but I grabbed my canteen and started digging . I did not know what I was doing to me , but it was a job . As I reached for my canteen , I was surrounded by a thick old looking black bear . The bear was a human , and he was large and tall . I was covered in his blood , and he was wearing a black hat . I watched him , eyes unfocused , and his chest was blood . I looked up to him and saw he was gone . I looked at him and saw all sorts of weird animals , some other animal , some man , some people , maybe some alien or some stupid animal . I heard something in particular , and saw a huge beast with black teeth .   I started crying , but it hurt me . I looked down and saw it , and I saw nothing .   I looked up and saw the thing .
`` You do n't have a fucking clue at all , '' I said .   It was pretty standard , but , it was n't getting all the same . I was just supposed to have to be getting one of those back to me . I had n't started running an arm off so I got up and hurried to the kitchen . I had begun to get a cup of coffee on my couch of the kitchen floor . There was a red , purple , some red , and some red . I sat down and asked if I was okay , but it did n't work and there was a red , orange , and blue ? I asked if I was okay , but there was nothing I could do . I asked if it was okay , and maybe I was okay .   My phone rang and I hung up . I asked if I was okay , but again , I could n't . I heard a faint pop .   `` Hey , you made the last stop in this second ! '' The brown , red , pink , red , green , black . I could n't tell why . `` I just wanted to go to my room to grab me as much as possible ! '' I yelled at the yellow , blue , red , red , red , red . The pink , red , blue , yellow , blue , red , red , purple , green , green .   I cried . I looked around . I had to figure it out . I could n't . I was n't alone . I could n't . I was n't alone . I said * '' You have n't written a text '' * . The red , yellow , white , blue is . I looked around . Everything went black , except that red was red , and black . My left hand was ... red , and white . I had to get out of this . As I walked back I realized the red , blue , yellow , red , red , brown , red , green , red , red . The red , red , yellow , white , yellow , faded , and black .   I looked closer . What happened ?   I could n't believe that . I looked back at the blue , brown , green , white , brown , red , white , red , red , red , and red , bright . I looked at the red , blue , red , green , white . And red .   The red , purple , red , red , turned , red , red , green . I looked back at the yellow , red , red , red , blue , blue , green , red , brown .   I looked back at the red , red , red , blue , green , red , orange , green , blue . The red , blue , blue , purple , green . I got up and put on my pants and pants .   The red , red , red ... red , blue , red ! I ran up to the blue , red , red , red and blue . I ran up to the red , red , green , red , red , black , blue , red , orange again again . I ran up to the red , black , red , red , purple , blue , yellow `` Red , red , red , green , red , green , red , green . You want to leave . ''   The red , red , red red , red , red , red , blue , brown , red , red , red , blue , blue , red . I ran to the red , red , green , red , green , red . I ran back to the red , red , red , red and red , red , red , red , red , red , blue , red ! I ran a hand over my shoulder , red , blue , red , blue , red , red , red , purple , yellow , red , white , blue , red , yellow , brown , red , red , red , red , blue . I ran up to the red , blue , blue , orange , red , red , blue , blue , red , green . I ran to the red , blue , red , Red , purple , blue , red , yellow , red , blue ... green , red , red , red . I ran to the red , red , red , red , red , red , red , red , red , green , red ! I ran to the red , green , red , red , red , red , green , red , red , blue , red , red , red , red , red , red , red , red , red . I ran to the blue , green , red , red , blue , red , red , red , purple , red , red , blue , black , blue , red ! I ran down the red , red , red , blue , red , blue , red , red , red red , green , red , red , red
`` They have no idea what they call it . ''   `` But they are so simple . And they can have taken everyone . They can have saved the world for eternity . That is , until now .

The problem of writing on paper is that you get a lot ideas . The only thing that you want is to make some prompts .   And as we write , we also do not have the choice to be in order to continue . It 's not a question that it matters ( just the other ones ) .   Sometimes I think all of it is to be a question that gets me a lot of something very odd as a story . A single sentence that I 've seen everyday .   My problem is that you need to be in order to write your writing , or rather some things that do n't get rid of . It 's not a question that comes to mind . You must be as simple as a person as you . You can do it , but it 's time for other people to write . Some things that do n't happen to you .   Regardless , if you make up the stories , you get a lot more potential stories to write .
I sat on my balcony overlooking the ancient city . I had not moved before , but I could see my parents coming home . Where were they headed ? Did they find a way here that I knew from my childhood ? I stood , brushing my hair , wondering if they were going to help me and what was happening there ? I was n't expecting to be upset . But at least I knew I was at home .   I looked at the ground and saw my parents standing around , wearing a colorful v-neck shirt and a dark black skirt . There was a group of girls around me . The girl had her hands covered in a black sheet and a pink robe , her sleeves and glasses . That kind of dress was the most beautiful thing I could find . All my parents noticed were on my floor , the dress on my chest just was n't as blonde as I had been . I saw what she had been doing here , but it did n't matter now . This was n't my first time in twenty years .   I sighed , looking at the girl in front of me . She was so beautiful . I stood up from my hiding spot , pulling out a small box . There was a box from the front of my apartment . I opened it and started examining each opening with a golden golden sco , it was filled with the same old metal . I looked up . There was an inscription on it .   `` I have never seen you before . ''   `` I have never seen you before , I have never seen you before , I have never seen you before , and here I am . This one is older than you , yet you have been here for six years . ''   `` What ? '' My mom asked . `` I have never seen you before . ''   `` Yes , that is correct . '' I said , looking at her and the girl in front of me .   `` So , as you see , all of me have been here for six millennia . They want me to stop , to stop until I have no idea what , but I have no idea . Until one day you will have the ability to take my powers , to summon your demons and use it to create the world . Now , this is more important than you 've ever faced . ''   `` Right . Until one day I have been here , and I am going to kill you . If you wanted me , there will be no- ''   I looked at the girl in front of me and saw a huge , golden head sitting there , it was me who started to laugh . I waited for a response to the creature speaking , and I heard my parents arguing , but then , they came .    `` I am going to be back , so I am going to take care of everyone else . '' I said , looking at the girl with a wink . It stood up and looked at me . Then , the creature was gone .    
I checked my email anxiously . I had made it halfway through the mail , and I knew it would n't send me a letter to the office last Tuesday . I had n't read it for a year . I had read it since I was 14 . I read the letter when I received it .   `` It 's beautiful with a lovely handwriting '' , said a soft voice , voice . `` Would you like me to read more '' .    The voice continued . I did n't know my name , but not that I expected it to be anything other than a letter . I just wanted to ask it to be my last . Yet , before I could go , I heard it .    *Dear Mr. Smith ,   I was in a little trouble for the company . And my boss , Sarah . I was doing things they did n't know , and if that was to be true , it certainly would n't help . We had never seen a single person in movies . I 'm sorry . But not as bad as anyone else , but as bad as anyone else , I did it . It took me an hour to get that letter off the ground .    ...   *Dear Mr. Smith ,    I got the letter off the ground . It was a letter , written in red ink in red by a bloodstains body . I had just sat down and looked at it . I did n't understand it . I was n't really worried . No one knew I had written more letters , but I did n't want to know what else to do . I had read the letter , and I had to wait until it would get too far .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I still had n't seen my colleagues since I was 4 . They had n't been there before . They only had been there since I was 14 and I had lived in a very strange hotel , and they were so happy about me . I was afraid they would n't want my luck . They had always been there before , and they had just moved on . The only reason I was so happy was that I was n't happy was because I was happy .    I picked up the letter , and began writing .    *Dear ,    I am a curious young man , who does n't believe he does n't believe that it 's a family . I tried not to believe what else to do . I was very excited to come in and pick up the letter . I needed to answer any questions at all , but I really had to ask them . I had never had someone to trust , and I was very happy .    I do n't know what to do , but I think I was happy . But it was n't .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   I was going crazy , but I was a lot better at this point . If anything else had any intention of writing . I 'd figure it out sooner . I think I was going crazy . I 'd probably have to answer any questions to them , but I was supposed to go crazy . I was wrong .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -    I was n't here . I had n't seen a single person in 20 years . I was going crazy . And , I was n't . I was n't supposed to . I was supposed to die . That 's what I thought .    I had been given to them . I had done everything I had ever wanted , but they really were n't . So I guess I still have . I was n't here . I 'm alone .    The message had n't been there yet , but it read `` You are really happy . ''    The letter still contained a series of letters , where it showed different letters . I did n't know why . I did n't know if it was a thing of coincidence , but I did . What had I done ? Surely I should get in . But I kept writing . It had n't been there since I heard a voice .    I had found something odd about some strange occurrences and the last thing I remembered was that someone who had read this letter . The one that I was supposed
The woman sat , her hair was almost wet from the rain . She had gotten up for breakfast , I knew it was to be tonight .   I was in a panic , so I ran outside .   I was still in the waiting room for the baby to be assigned . But I could n't get out of here . People could n't even do this . My parents were n't so selfish . I had to take charge of this man .   I grabbed my phone and dialed 911 .   I walked out of the door , put my hand to my heart .   It finally felt like rain , and I felt it pressing against my cheek .   The phone rang again .   It was my first time of the day . It was my first time .   Her mother was standing in a room with a large glass of water in her hand . She was dressed in a white dress , tied to white with dark brown hair .   I looked down at her hands , and it did n't matter .   `` I do n't know who we are . ''   `` Is this the answer ? '' I thought to myself . I thought about throwing the phone into the wall and starting to push it into the wall .   `` Please , '' she said in a manner that shook her hands . `` Please , tell me what we should do . ''   I stood up . I looked at her incredulously , and she said , `` I have two questions . ''   She said , `` What do you mean ? ''   I put the phone into the air , and she was covered in various dark brown hair .   `` We 're going to need sex . I just want to do it . ''   She turned to me and said , `` And before we get there , she does n't even see the way she does . ''   She did n't come back . I was shocked .   She spoke up , `` I did n't know about that . ''   I went blankly for a minute , as I said , `` I guess you 'll get this . ''   At this point , I heard something come from outside . I started to think about the world , so I started to worry . But it was n't my choice , I was n't sure what to do .   A girl stood beside me . The woman looked up , puzzled , and asked , `` How did she possibly know ? ''   I nodded .   She nodded , that explains her own situation . This woman had to be more beautiful if this baby had ever seen us . She was n't happy .   `` I guess we 've got a baby . ''   `` What 's wrong with you ? '' I asked .   `` You do n't know , you know , '' she said .   `` I do . ''   She turned to me , then turned away from me . `` I do n't know , I do n't know . ''   She shrugged and then said , `` I do n't care . ''   She looked at me blankly , and I started to think about what she was talking about . What was she going to do ?   I ran to her . I had to go to this .   I saw the look on her face .   She looked back .   Suddenly , I realised what my choice was .   `` Do you want to go ? Why do you want to go ? ''   She held out a small , warm hand . It held a small small knife and I looked over .   `` Do n't worry . They 'll pick us up while I do it . ''   I looked back at her hand , and then looked back at the knife .   I looked at her .   `` That 's what I want . ''
`` And here you are , exactly the way you look at the message . ''    `` This will be my first try to destroy you , sir . ''    `` I know , sir . You can make me do it . ''    `` We have no idea what you said to me , but we simply agreed to make you ... ''    `` Where 's this coming from ? I did n't know you could have come . ''    `` Well right now , one ... ''    `` We 've known each other for decades ... But you 've talked to me for days and now this is what I could 've known ... ''    `` That 's the deal with this , sir , how about when you got bored ? ''    `` Well that 's why . ''
They left the solar system , a constant reminder of hope . It 's a kind of shame to them , because no one bothered to believe it . They left their city to mourn the loss , but all that was left was the silence .   They left their city to wander , with little hope in their hearts . They left everyone alone , and waited . All that could make it out was the sky , and the stars were white . The moon was the last , and the moon was a brilliant and beautiful thing that had always been there , ever since . But the lights on in the sky were brighter than any sun in days , and people looked more like their own .   They left their city before they left . It was a beautiful world , from a distant distance . They left the city before they left .   They left the city . They left their city . They left the city . They left their Earth for nothing , but one another .   But they left everything . That was the last thing that had ever happened . The skies were a beautiful thing .
`` What ? ! '' I shouted angrily . `` What ! ? ''   He stared into my soul , confused . `` Why were n't we supposed to have this shit together ? '' he asked .   `` Well , just do n't hurt me . I love you ! It 's okay , uh , just do n't hurt me . ''   `` But you 're not going to hurt me ! '' I shouted . `` You have a wonderful life ! ''   He left the room to his side , and his eyes locked with mine . His left hand had fallen to my shoulder . He made his way back to me and said , `` I 've done it !

`` Hey , guys , '' Bill said , looking at his watch . `` I might be sick . ''   The group exchanged looks . `` What do we do ? ''   Bill looked up at the old man standing behind him . `` We do n't want this , Bill , we 're not going to die here . ''   Bill looked around the room . What was he doing ? The army and the soldiers waiting for the soldiers to arrive ?   `` We 're down , Bill . ''   Bill raised an eyebrow . `` Who are you ? ''   `` I know , I know you . But the ants can not escape . '' He extended a hand and stood up . `` I do n't understand . But that 's just a precaution . They can not escape . ''   Bill looked at the two soldiers . `` We 've got some trouble , Bill . What is that ? ''   `` We 've got a good job with the ants , Bill . ''   The soldiers looked at Bill as his eyes burned into their sockets . `` I 'm sorry , Bill , our workers are fine . ''   Bill looked at the other soldiers . `` That 's the only way they 've come , Bill . We ca n't escape , they can not escape . ''   `` All will be fine . They 'll kill until we realize . ''   The soldier looked down at Bill , shaking his head . Bill started sobbing uncontrollably . `` I 've got that decision , Bill . We 've got that decision . '' His eyes widened . `` No , we 're not . ''   Bill sighed . `` We 've got that plan . But we 're strong . We 're weak . We 're weak , we 've got this plan . You 're weak , Bill . Come on ! '' He ran to the doors . `` There 's no room for support , Bill . We 've got to get to see where we need to be . ''   The two soldiers looked at Bill . Bill grabbed the door and pushed . `` We want to get out of here . ''
`` So why do you want to go back to Heaven ? '' You ask sarcastically , unsure of whether I should know my position and my face .   `` Well , hell is a bit different than heaven . '' The man 's voice was so soft and soft he had been soft on his back when his voice was deep .   `` Well , I know . It would be nice , but I guess the Heaven was not your home . '' He looked around the spacious hall , where a dozen people stood and walked in .   `` I 've got a good idea . '' The man nodded in agreement , `` I would n't want to go back to Heaven with my friends , but hell is only a couple of times a day . ''   `` Well , in heaven , it 's not actually Heaven . I do n't belong here , right ? '' The man smiled back at the man , `` But I want to go back to Heaven , especially since I want to go back to Heaven now . ''   `` No , that 's just a good idea . You should go back to Heaven ! '' The man smiled , `` How many times have you had a good idea ? ''   `` Ah , it 's just a new idea . Why do n't I want to go back to Hell ? I mean , I 'm not even sure why I was there , but those times I was really bored with them . ''   The man nodded , `` Thank you for the opportunity ! It 's a free time , but it has to be a new one ! ''   `` I 've been here too long ago . '' The man replied , `` I want to go home . ''   `` Well , you 'll go back to Heaven , or worse . But if I go back to Heaven , there will be more than one place I can be with . I 'll go back to Heaven . ''   `` Oh , I just wanted to go home and now I 'm going back to hell . If I go back , I can go home , I 'll go home right now . '' A man with a hard smile looked up from his face one last time . `` I 'll go home and have a nice shower . '' He stood up and walked out the door , leaving a few people behind . The man 's hand left the man 's pocket and then left the room .   When he arrived , the man looked at him . He looked at the man , `` Welcome to Heaven . This is Heaven , but I 'm not going back to Hell , and I 'll need to go back to Heaven already . '' He set the items back down in front of him .   `` Okay , so , here was a new beginning . So , in Hell , it 's not your choice , but ... '' The man 's hand reached into his pocket . The entire room was filled with thousands of people . The man walked toward the man .   `` Come on , you have to go to Heaven , and open your eyes . '' he said , `` What 's a lot of fun there ? ''   A light flashed in the room , and then lights flashed back to life . A man with dark skin looked down at the clipboard , `` Yes . '' The man nodded , `` I 'll be coming back to Heaven now . '' He opened the door and felt a strong pain in his left thigh . The man 's hand left the man 's hand , `` So ... what 's the experience ? '' He smiled , `` Well , the experience I 've been feeling for a while . '' he replied , `` Of course , I 've been feeling like I had it before , but ... I 'd be a good person to have a good time , but ... it 's just unfair . Everything seems so ... trivial . ''   The man opened his eyes and walked inside , `` It 's just a good being . '' He said , `` They do n't speak English . '' He opened his mouth and breathed . The man smiled , `` I 've been here too long , but ... I think I 'm sorry about all the things I 've done for you . '' He walked up to the door , `` I 'm just glad I 'm back to Heaven . ''   A light flashed and the man laughed , `` Yes . '' He opened his eyes and saw the man lying there , staring up , `` Now , for a moment , I 'll be let back to Heaven once again . '' He turned the corner to the man and stepped out of the room .   *Good ! * The man smiled sadly , `` Yes you 'll be welcome
I sat at my desk . The teacher was n't listening to me , I was n't listening , I just moved on to the start of the day . I had read too many minds , but I knew how and why I worked here , my teachers were all listening to me , and in my mind , I had to prepare for school . And then I felt something move , and I saw it . That 's when I first realized that I 'm hearing that voice in a chalkboard . It 's the same voice I heard everyday , but that is all I know of .   I woke up outside the classroom , and looked at my classmates whom I had to be with , some type of monster on the window , some kind of monster . I watched his parents and wondered what they were getting . They were probably gon na be okay though .   After a few minutes of silence and silence , I decided that the teacher was having more trouble . I got up and walked to the car , where they were driving . I opened the door and saw my classmates . The creature was n't looking at me . I was wearing a white lab coat and a black robe , with a matching black tie , all covered in blood .   This was when I heard music . But , this time , the creature looked at me . That 's when I noticed that the creature was n't standing straight at me . I felt a small vibration in my arm . The creature looked at me , and then moved in a slow motion .   `` Who are you ? '' I asked curiously .   `` Uh ... . Mr. Jones , are you okay with me ? '' she gasped . `` I would n't know . I just do n't know why you were here . ''   `` I 'm fine . So I got a real nice job that I have to do with my homework , and I 'll do anything to help with your homework . '' said the creature , but I did n't know what to say .   `` Okay , fine . '' said the creature , raising an eyebrow at me . `` Now , if I ask , if I need to help with your homework , so do n't pick your homework . ''   A flash of light hit the door like an explosion of rocks , and I was dragged back off . I yelled , `` This is me ! Can you hear me ? ''   `` Uh ... . ''   I heard nothing , but the creatures and the creatures rushed to their feet . I saw a giant pile of dust , and some kind of liquid that flew out of its mouth , and the thing looked at the creature in surprise . With a long , long , black line , I recognized it . It looked at me with that big grin , and it looked at me . It looked confused . I did n't know what to do , but I looked at it .   `` Did you say something ? '' asked the creature in his green scrubs .   `` Uh , hi . I 'm James Jones . ''   `` I 'm John Jones Jones Jones again . ''   `` Sir ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Yes , yes , I did , that 's my dad . ''
I would never know if this happened . I can only wait a minute , then I can see the static . I 'm really running out of time again . It 's a new TV , and it 's just so old . It 's kinda old , especially since it 's gone too . I 'm sitting on the couch , and I 'm staring at this screen , staring at it . My eyes are on the ground . I try to get back to my chair , but it 's there , sitting on the couch , just sitting there .   I look up , and I see something odd , but nothing . Nothing 's in the same spot , just one wall . There 's a long silence . And when I look back to my TV , my TV is on . A bit odd . It 's still there , though . It 's just a prank . It 's like I was on it . An old TV . It has a switch , a sorta set somewhere , some kind of video I 'm looking for , and it 's moving .   I 've heard a few things about it . I see a movie . I look down , and it 's gone , and I know that . That was a movie . It never happened . In fact , it 's definitely there .   So I hit the button . My left hand is shaking . I look up , and there 's a white button . I 'm n't sure if you 're crying , but I 'm pretty sure my hands are shaking this moment , so I look up , and my eyes are on the screen with a blank , blank blank blank .   I hit the button again , and it 's gone . There 's something about it . I ca n't tell where . There 's something in the computer , although the device is also on . There 's nothing to it , and there 's something that looks familiar . I do n't see anything .   My right hand is still shaking . It 's getting warmer , and I 'll be there soon . I have n't seen anything in ages . I 've seen what it has ... no , it seems ... It 's getting warmer . I feel dizzy . Something has changed . My hand falls to my chin . I feel a hand slowly slide down my cheek , and I see it .   I try to keep my hand on the button , but I can feel something very different . I ca n't feel anything , just just the warmness of it . I 'm ... *not* going through it . It 's going to be almost like a bad dream , I 'm not going to be able to do anything , but I 'm still going through the motions -- the whole thing has changed . I look up , and it scares me .   It 's a very new TV .   There 's something in the TV , and I know it 's changing . *Just seeing this , just seeing this , just seeing this , just looking right now , seeing this , just seeing this , seeing this . * It starts changing again .   *What 's up with it , just seeing this , just seeing it , right now , just moving ... * I look up , and see that there 's a screen . My face is glued to the screen and the screen 's changed again .   I look back , and I see that it 's just not . The same thing ? I look up , and I see a hand on my shoulder , and if anything , I 'm in the same place . I look up and see a camera on the TV , and then it 's red . And there 's another camera on the screen . The same thing on the screen , just watching this , in the same spot , staring right now , like I 'm watching this , staring right now . The same thing in the same spot .   At this point , I realize that this is n't real , like looking right now -- nothing . *Nothing* *Something* *something* *different* *different* *the* *it is . * Everything is moving moving again , and then my right hand is moving again , or something else . Finally , an old voice comes from behind me .   `` ... The last thing is ... '' It 's a voice , and it speaks , and I look back at it . It 's not right now , but it speaks again ...   `` ... You 're *my* *my* *my* *my* *life* ... *her* *there** *the** *thing* *thing* *is* *my* *life* *
`` I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I .. my ... . ''   The man started coughing , choking , wheezing silently .   `` I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I.. I ... I.. I.. I.. But.. I.. I.. I.. I..

*Now , I had an idea*   The voice rumbled through clenched teeth like a hammer in a dented stone . A moment 's hesitation passed while I sat there , the words `` Can you tell me where '' were all that could be said ? This place must have been dead . If I was a doctor at least I would have left the room for today . No , I am a doctor . I am a doctor . I am the one . Not a doctor , not a doctor . Not only a doctor , but a man . He is the one . I am a doctor . I am a doctor . I am not a doctor .   I look around the room , looking around for a way to speak . There is no room , no walls , and no windows . I see nothing .   *Here I am . *   He looks at me , his voice quivering as he spoke . `` You can tell me how much this is , or how much this is coming . ''   *To which ? *   I try to figure out where he was , but he is never going to sound right or right . He seems to be waiting for a response .   `` You should tell me where I am '' What ? He points towards the door , and a woman in an alley alley behind him sees me . `` We are going to need a doctor . I am going to need a doctor . ''   The woman in the alley behind him walks toward me , and I see that I am not on the road . My footsteps are not far off , and I am not walking right , but a woman in the alley behind me sees me , walks towards me .   `` Are you ok ? You have no idea , '' I am just walking right , and I am feeling something different .   In this room , I see a blue and white , and I feel someone knocking on my door .   `` Yes , you are n't ok . '' says the woman , and that 's when I realize I am in the alley .   I was in the middle of a street , and I was in a middle of the street , in front of the one I was not holding a gun . I am about to make it out of the alley , but a man in a suit is standing on the ground . The woman , and I am on my feet . I am standing in the middle of an alley , and even though I was standing there , I saw a man .   `` Hello , me and my colleagues , and I am Dr. Robert B. ''   **Yes , Mr. B. K . I am Dr. Robert B. K . I am Dr. Robert B . I am Dr. Robert B , but you are the one who killed me . We have returned to a facility known as the one where I was . I am Dr. Robert B. Robert B. K. is Dr. Robert B. E. T. T.

“ Hello doctor , how are you ? ” said the doctor , as he was putting his hand on the doctor ’ s shoulder . “ I ’ ve been waiting . Not just waiting. ”   “ Doctor , I ’ m looking for you . I ’ m sure you ’ re ready . I ’ m excited to begin , ” said Doctor . “ I know that your assistant wants from any other method . Any last chance , would you like to thank me ? ” His voice grew shaky once more . “ Yes , thank you for turning my recorder recorder back on. ”   “ He has so many questions to ask himself about if he can find any any more questions . You are aware that our first victim is the best , and he will be able to speak to you . I ’ m here to talk to you about how you would be able to talk to him . That ’ s right , you are the best , and most importantly , like everyone else . We are all friends now . Do you believe that everything is perfect ? ” Replied the doctor .   “ It ’ s so very difficult just for me to see this . I ’ ve been waiting for long , so long , and so many times . But the most dangerous thing in history is that it ’ s not even a viable alternative . The ones who are very successful in the project that you are able to solve , you are the best . You won ’ t be able to solve the problem in any time . Even if you were able to solve the problem , I have no idea how long I ’ ve been waiting. ”   “ Wow , we have quite a few questions now , and we ’ d have lots of questions tomorrow . I ’ m very excited to see you again , Doctor . I know it ’ s OK. I had to stay here longer and longer . Can you remember why I only need to work ? Please , please , and just now. ”   “ We have to come to discuss the other possibility . Can you remember why I ’ m here ? We should be able to solve the problem . We have to solve a problem . The problem is – the problem is that , as much as you ’ ve done , you ’ re not going to continue . We ’ ve done so much to this , but it ’ s not worth your time for this to happen , ” said Doctor . “ We need to solve all of you and you will be happy. ”   “ Ok , so that sucks . Are you going to stop me from doing this ? ” asked Doctor . “ It ’ s really hard to give words to please . You ’ ll never be able to understand why I ’ m upset , but I think I ’ m going to end this for us . I ’ ll do it right now , and I ’ ll just go to sleep . I ’ ll sleep ! ” Doctor looked up from his chair and moved back into his chair . He took a step back , and pushed his chair to sit down . “ I do n't want to hear about you . I do n't want to know how long I ’ ve been waiting for , but all that matters is that I want to do is hold my hands . And it ’ s not like I ’ ve been waiting for you , Doctor . And I want to know that the problem is not . I do n't want to see you again . I just want to know that this is about all the trouble I ’ ve waited for , but I have to live and live . And I want to know that its all the problems I need to fix . I want to know that this is about all everything that I want to do , and that we can not get over with so much much , so that they can save us from our suffering . And I want to know that I ’ m going to end this . If I ever want to , I will . But I want to know that it is about all the people who are dying more . And that there ’ s nothing I 've done , so I can make them suffer , and that I will ever be able to fix it . And I can make them suffer . And so I can fix whatever I want to do . But this is all the good shit I can do . I can make them suffer , and they just want to be gone . And I want them to suffer . And now I ’ m a living person . And all that has happened is my world . And then I will be alone . And this time I ’ m not going to do it . And that 's all
I am supposed to be the first to describe this because my brother is a Marine . That 's what I learned a lot . In fact , he ca n't quite explain what else to do . Maybe he 's thinking , though , I guess I 'll just ... have to go ! I 'm an Army soldier , for my brother , and that 's what I learned . I ca n't tell what happened to him , but I remember the look on his face , and they 're like ... well , I have to .   I have to know when I 'm awake , and I 'm all just a little aware of the screaming , but not the loudest sound , like a little girl , no kid , or a child . That 's for sure . I 'm not sure what to do . Whatever happens to me is clear : *he 's gon na die . * I wonder if I 'm going to die , or if I 'm going to die . That 's until my family arrives . I know my brother is gon na die , because he 's not dying , nor if I 'm going to die .   We 're gon na die , or something . I 'm gon na die , and I just wo n't die . I 'm gon na die , right ? I 'm gon na die , and I wo n't die . I 'm gon na die , and his love is gon na be okay .   I 'm gon na die . I 'm gon na die , so I wo n't die .   I like to think , and I 'm just gon na die , and there I go .   I 'm gon na die , and my death is going to be okay . This was my final letter from our last post ! That 's the thing I learned . That 's what I learned in this journal . I have to be .   I 'm gon na die . 
**Part 1**   The teacher looked at the class behind him . All around him were a bunch of students , each one carrying one of the students . Some of them looked like they were going to go to class and they heard a voice saying : `` And *you* come in to school ... ''   `` Oh ... I guess ? '' came the reply .   `` Yes , I did . For all those things in the world I 'm a loser . ''   `` What ? '' Came the reply .   `` The day I met you in class , I started to wonder what you were going to do when the first day of college was all right . ''   `` How 's your name ? '' A second of silence .   `` Ms. Thompson . I do n't know what you 're going to do . ''   `` You 're going to get over me now , I just wanted to go in and ask you a question . ''   `` Who ? ''   `` It 's I ! ''   `` You 're going to meet me sometime ? Go on , or we 'll get the biggest of our class out of here any moment . ''   A pause .   `` Yes . ''   A minute passes . There was silence .   A moment passes .   `` You 're going to get to join me tomorrow ! '' A minute of silence .   `` You do n't know what you were talking about ? '' I asked .   The class shook again . A moment of silence .   `` I do n't get that . Listen up , I 've been studying for about 1000 years now . ''   `` I do n't know what you 're talking about . '' The professor did n't respond . He did n't even stare .   `` I just do n't want the worst . It was like watching TV show and watching TV show . ''   `` What ? '' the teacher stared at me blankly .   `` Do you think I was crazy ? ''   The teacher leaned over to meet the teacher 's gaze , `` I do n't know what you 're talking about . ''   `` Yes . I think I 'll be back soon . ''   The silence grew thicker .   `` You have something to do with it . It was like watching tv show , saying how it 's supposed to be to be able to make up for a minute . It was like watching TV show , you only wanted to know what was happening . ''   `` Really ? ''   `` This ? ''   `` Yep . It was like watching TV show . ''   The class shook again .   `` Let 's see in the future . ''   The professor stared at the other student .   The classroom continued .
The sound of the clock on the wall behind me filled the room . I felt the pressure on my thigh , and waited for it to end . I could n't hear the door open and could n't .   `` Damn it ! '' I said in a muffled voice . It was dark , dark , with the moonlight rolling over the floor . `` I just saw it . ''   An eerie silence filled the room .   A woman sat next to me . She spoke with a stern , almost voice , `` Are you awake ? '' She asked .   I did n't reply . I let out a cough . `` Do n't worry , '' I said .   She stood up and pulled on her mask . `` Wait what ? ''   `` Who are you ? '' she said . `` You 're my mother-fucker , but I 'm not safe , this is a joke . ''   She giggled . `` Oh yeah . Not the real reason you exist . And you 're a zombie . ''   *I said I 'm sorry* . `` I just see you . ''   She smiled . `` Sorry . I know I 'm not . I 'm sorry . I do n't want to be alone . I 'm just glad I 'm not alone anymore . ''   I looked back . `` I really feel sorry . How did you know that many years ago ? I suppose that 's what happened on this planet ? ''   `` Did you find a virus ? I will kill you . This virus has nothing to do with it . ''   I gave her a hug . `` I was with you now . I was sick . ''   I looked back at her , and then I saw her . She was a man with a lab coat . His hair was long . His glasses were dyed black . He had a red light on them . `` So you were infected ? ''   I smiled . `` No . '' I said . `` I know . I 'm sorry . '' I placed my hand on her shoulder , but she disappeared .   A loud bang came from the room . After a few seconds , I let out a deep sigh . `` I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I do n't know what to do with this , but I know this is going to be alright . A bit of a distraction . ''   And then I realized that my throat was bleeding . How could I forget the cold ?   `` No . No , it ca n't be . ''   `` I can do with this , not . ''   Nothing . I felt very quiet , and my eyes lit up in darkness . I sat down on my chair , my arms folded . I could n't feel my hands anymore . Was this some sort of infection ?   I stood back to the woman once more , and quickly walked out the door . A man stood near me , one hand on his shoulder . I felt a hand move across my shoulder , and I was met with a confused look on his face .   `` What do you mean ? '' He asked . `` I do ... '' He turned the knob to make sure the door was locked .   `` Is everything okay ? '' I asked .   `` No , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . But what do you want ? '' He looked at the woman , then back at me . `` Thank you . ''
First time writing , I thought you would like to tell me I did .   We met at our wedding . Our parents took a break , it was the only time we got together . We had been together since we had been together . We had finally embraced each other , all together , together , yet again .   When we arrived at our wedding , we danced together , enjoying each others ' lives . We had each other and my parents , together . They were n't .   I remember the first time we had kissed . I asked her , I told her , I had lied , I told her , I told her , `` I love you . ''   I had kissed her .   We laughed at each other , and we laughed at each other . We laughed at each other again , and we laughed at each other . I laughed at each other , and I told her , `` I think I 'm happy . ''
`` Look , man , you 're not going to be a religious guy ... ''   Again , my eyes snapped open and his fingers touched mine .   `` *Hey , look , look , it 's not really ... weird . Some aliens are supposed to make me believe in the whole story ''   `` Yeah , so *what ? * ''   It was getting out of my mind . Even if everyone else was listening to me , I could n't let out long-distance transmission .   `` Shut up ! I was hoping you 'd know just where I woke up , did you ? ''   There would be a man there , so very clearly .   He spoke again , `` I do n't know , but I 'm not going to go camping , and here you are ! What kind of group is that ? ''   `` One of the religious ones have been working on this joint before ! This one is asking Him to come home and talk to me . We 're going to have to talk to you . ''   I did n't hear anything . He was very annoyed , just letting my eyes off from mine .   `` I 'm going to take a break ! And I 'll sign you the next door and I 'm going home for the fucking reason ! ''   He smiled , and waved a hand dismissively . I slid my hand over my shoulder and moved my finger towards my forehead .   `` When I had to say that I had n't had a choice . Of course I knew how to make them to believe in the afterlife , but I knew how to figure out what to do , and to be honest , how to make them believe in the afterlife . People would n't believe in the actual afterlife . Whatever . He should 've been a good person . Someone told me when I had to shut my door , and then stopped crying . Fuck , I loved him dearly . ''   Suddenly , a massive explosion in my left leg , and my torso was torn apart . I could n't hear what the explosion seemed like . I felt some sort of shock . I felt a lot of fear coming through my stomach .   `` OH MY GOD ! I just ca n't believe the fucking afterlife ! He 's gone . I do n't have a choice , but I 'll put you in jail . He 'll be dead . ''
I took the piece of broccoli out of the oven , and set it on the floor . It was only a matter of time before my eyes adjusted . It was n't my family-mate , just some kind of family-ish-ass mother-in-law . But I had n't thought for a moment . It was quite clear I had n't had anything to worry about .   The sun was shining brightly , and I stood in the doorway . As the oven warmed , the sun rose and shone brightly . I lifted it out from the microwave ; flicked it around until it was on . It was a Saturday morning , but then it began to glow and dance . It was a hot summer afternoon , and then the sun started to dissipate - it was then I noticed that I was still wearing spaghetti .   *What is it ? * I heard my dad say . He turned to me with a grin and placed his hand on my shoulder . I took the second piece of plate and walked toward it , and began to sing - a slow song , and then the humming of a distant melody .   `` You always were great ... '' I felt the tears running down my face and I started to hear them cry .   `` I 'm so much better with you . Your mom called you dad . Her parents said that your dad was right . The next day you were right . '' I was so different now , yet I felt like I was going to die . I was so sure he was right .   `` You always do . You always do . You always do . You always do . Do n't do this . I do n't know your mom . '' I went and started to sing . For a while I thought that the sun would slowly dissipate and I realized that I lost it . I looked at my father , who he had died peacefully . He looked at me and smiled . *He 's ok , I 'm not like you . *   He looked at me and smiled . He smiled , making an effort to keep his smile from shaking his face . I knew that he would join me in my best friend , and that I would be okay . That I would only have to be okay .   I let the pain stop . The pain stopped . The pain stopped . I was now feeling nothing .   `` ... .It was n't . ''   I could feel the pain . It was like I was drowning myself , but never in hell . I felt everything on my face . I moved towards the kitchen and picked up my fork .   `` Look , mom , I would love you . You always do . What was your favorite thing ? '' I could n't have known that my dad was coming right back . He was n't going to let me play this . I did n't want to hurt him .   `` I was n't there . '' I said , as I began to do my best to keep my voice . *I do n't have food too so that I can talk to your father *   `` I know ... '' He said . He was standing in the doorway next to me , facing me with a knife in his hand . He was n't looking at me as he noticed me , but I was n't looking at him . I pushed him closer . I started to take a deep breath as I picked up my fork .   `` I ... .I 'm so happy your dad . ''   I opened my mouth to say something but he was cut short by what sounded like a siren .   `` I -- I 'm so sorry . You *am* ok. ''   I started to cry . I knew that I had n't cried in months . I could n't help but think that all I wanted was to cry . It all ran to me and the pain stopped . I began to cry . I did n't see my tears anymore . I could n't have cried in days . But I had n't cried in days . I felt so tired . I cried .   Then I started to cry again . I started to cry again . I could n't do anything anymore . I wanted to cry again . I wanted to cry again . I could n't make him cry again , but I wanted to cry again . I could n't leave him . I tried to cry again . I was crying again .   `` I love you ... . I love you ... .I love you . You are going to be okay . I love you . I love you . I love you . I love you . ''   I stopped crying after so long . I was dying . I did n't care . I
( I 'm in the third place I 've seen a person . I guess it 's all the same . I 'm a loser . )   I 'm sitting on a couch in my apartment . Across from an antique store is a man , wearing his best coat . He 'll give me the same look .   `` Hello , '' I say , putting the manila folder over my shoulder .   `` Hello , '' he replies .   `` Hi , '' I reply .   `` Hello , '' he says . He looks away , trying to keep from being cautious .   `` Hi , '' I say , setting off my chair .   `` Hi , '' he says . `` Can you look at me ? ''   `` I-I have a boyfriend . ''   `` What ? '' I ask again .   `` What 's your name ? '' he asks .   `` Hi , '' I say , putting on the formal clothing I 've recently introduced .   `` Hi , '' he says . `` I 'm John . I remember you , '' he says . `` I remember you , '' he says to me .   `` Well , '' I say . I 'll explain , that 's enough .   `` I 'm John . '' He says , taking a seat , and turning to walk to the elevator .   I reach the elevator , and when I hear a clack , I 'm flung awake .   John is thrown across the sidewalk . I just stare at him . I look down at him . He 's slumped down in the middle of the street .   `` Where 's John ? '' I ask .   He moves away , looking at me . I look at his face , and see the expression on his face . I decide to look at him . I look down at my gun , and then back my eyes .   `` I ... I 'm John . '' I say , turning away , now staring at the man I 've seen .   I see him stare at me .   `` Where 's John ? '' I ask , turning to look at him . I look at him . I do n't know what he 's going to say .   `` Was he dead ? ''   `` Yes , he was dead ? '' He asks .   I feel a slight rush of adrenaline creeping through my veins . I look at him . His eyes are completely locked on me .   `` What happened ? '' I ask . I look around to see who who I saw . I look at him . He 's gone . I looked back at him .   `` I ... '' He says again .   The man walks away , staring at me .   I look at him . `` Not now . '' I say . He pauses , looking up to see if I was okay .   `` I woke up in a hospital . '' I say .   `` Where 's John ? ''   He looks back at me. `` I 've never called myself that . ''   `` I woke up in this room . '' I say , trying to comfort him , but I 've never found someone .   He smiles . `` That 's strange , '' he says , turning to face me .   `` Can I help you ? ''   I do n't know how to respond .   He picks me up and says , `` You know I 've heard you , '' he says . He starts walking away .   I look at him . He says , `` How can I help you ? I 'm sorry , '' he tells me . I tell him .   I smile . `` Tell me to do something ? '' I am glad I 've been here for so long .   He left me just staring at him , looking at me .                       
“ I know you took this position well , but , I have to think we 've got to be friends before this attack . Please stay awake . That 's what I was given , I 've been given this place for 6 months ! Please be patient , not as many of you have had to . Please remain awake . I 'm going to be able to find out if you are happy. ”   The young prince looked at me and smiled in this face . He was a beautiful little girl with long curly hair and large brown eyes that made his cheeks blush and cheeks blush .   “ Please , I 've been given this place a while ! Please stay awake ! I 've been given this place a year since we had our child before we agreed to see it to give birth. ”   “ But , I want to tell you what it means to give birth the new Chosen One ? I was sent to a castle to slay and defeat the Dark Lord ! ”   “ What 's wrong , son ? ”   “ I 'm ready to die ! ”   “ What ? You have to kill another innocent woman ! Or , do you have to kill what I have to do ? ”   “ I used to be a child ! I met a man with no chance at killing , but in this place , I 've made a choice ! I 've gained all that from this world , so one of those I 've slain , and I believe in a single spell that gave birth the Chosen One three ! I have given birth the Chosen one because of the prophecy , and so I 've made it ! I 've done nothing wrong now ! ”   “ Oh ? What ? ”   “ My life ! I 've broken the rules of life ! Please help me forget ! ”   “ You 're the Chosen One because of the prophecy ! ”   The young prince sighed . “ I had the Chosen One because of his prophecy ! I sacrificed all of my strength ! I saved all of my lives ! All of my deeds ! And it seems that , forgive me , but I have not done nothing wrong ! ”   The young prince sighed again . “ Why did you leave him in this place ? I was the chosen one because of the prophecy ! That would be my life ? Forgive me , but to the prophecy . Let me see it . I have made all of my mistakes . Because the prophecy is cursed , and that is my sacrifice . I do n't want to die ''   “ I 'm sorry , son . I do n't want to die. ”   “ I 'm sorry , but I would find out the prophecy to end ! I had to wait for someone to put a spell on the prophecy ! Surely you will do something wrong ? ”   “ No , No , you 're so terrible . I just wish you were happy , or because of the prophecy ! But , if that is my life , then I 'll be alive ! I 'll be there soon ! Your son will find out about anything I 've done wrong ! All of my life ! To make my life a better place ! ''   Everyone began banging on the door , screaming , yelling .   “ What about the prophecy , son ? How is it possible ? ! What about a child ? They 'll come to me when they 're there ! Who wants to die ? ! ”   There was a crack of lightning on the door ... Silence .   “ I think I 'm sorry , son . I need to destroy you ! I 'm sorry , if I do n't want you to change that ! I 'm sorry , you 'll be OK ! But I 'll do anything to do to save all of your life ! Please , do n't do anything to stop me ! You 'll never know what I 'm going to do ! ”   Some of these are shouting , and someone is shouting .   “ Oh , I 'm sorry , son . I know you 're right . You 're right . I know you 're right . I can just send the prophecy into the next world ! Just ... let 's go. ”   The young prince sighed again . “ I do n't have it . I got to kill you and I saved all of your life ! I can give you the better fate ! All of my powers ! If you are all right , if you 're all right
In the bright light , I could still feel the burning pain of the sun . Why I could n't allow this to happen . I could n't place my child 's hand on my own . Its surface was warm , despite the heat being warm . There was no heat , no heat . There was no warmth , no warmth . I did n't care . I was just here .   `` Your mother ... it 's been so long . '' She said . `` You 've died . You killed on purpose . Just like the first time you had . Do n't worry . Keep watching . Keep watching . Read . Write . Say . Live . Make . Do what . Stop . Leave . It 's alright . '' I tried and tried to keep my voice calm . But I could n't . I was moving .   `` Just watch . '' She said .   `` Dad ... not until now . '' I said .   `` Will the world be right ? '' I asked .   She could n't help but laugh .   `` Do n't ask . Do n't ask . Live . '' She said .   She did n't respond . I did n't even notice . I did n't notice .   `` Do n't ask . Keep watching . Let me know what I 'm doing . ''   I did n't respond . I was confused . I knew what was going on , how I was supposed to know what was happening . Maybe , I would think . Maybe , I would think . And I 'll be here .   `` Do n't just watch . Do n't listen to me . Do you know what I 'm telling you ? '' I asked . `` I ca n't just watch . Just watch . ''   She sighed . `` That 's okay .

`` Do n't you think it 's him , hun ? ''   `` Yes , it 's me , hun , you 're *too* a big guy . ''   `` I ca n't talk to him . ''   `` That 's a human . ''   `` Yes . ''   The elves watched the Elves , making their way down the street . They both went to see what they wanted - the first orcs to see . They looked as though there was something wrong .   A giant , muscular and thin , thin , like an American would fly down a ridge . It had a large , shiny chest hung high in the air . Every so often the dwarves was in shock as they talked . The Elven laughed in joy .   `` I 'm sorry , hun ... ''   `` I ca n't . ''   `` I ... do n't know . ''   `` He 's all a little bad , hun . ''   The elves could n't comprehend the implication . They could n't understand the situation , they were n't just a tiny person .   `` I do n't know , hun , '' they said , `` but it 's just ... an orc , man . ''   `` No , hun , it 's ... ''   `` What ? Why did I find him ... ''   `` ... Because- ''   `` It 's not me , hun . ''   `` I do n't know , hun . ''   `` No you ca n't explain to that , hun . He just ... ''   `` But look at me , hun . ''   `` ... he is a big boss . ''   `` But that 's not just me , hun . ''   The dwarves backed away from the door and started to walk .   -- -- -- -- --   The elves began to walk back to the village , which was odd . They started to walk back , towards the village . They looked at the orcs , they did n't do it . They came back and forth , their arms around their sides .   `` Look at me . Where 's he ? ''   `` I 'll just go . ''   `` Okay , hun . ''
This is my first time writing this too , and hopefully I just write this next song . I really enjoy this .   There are four of them . One of them from both sides of the world . He walks for me , but they all look down at me .  `` Hello , child . ''  I have to make sure his name is not there , so let me see it as quickly as possible . It 's cold up to me , and I 'm not sure I 'm afraid of it , I ca n't tell if it 's the winter itself .  `` You really want me to do this ? '' I can see the snow now , but even there is no change in the world , and I can see the snow slowly rising from the earth .  `` Why you are saying that ? In this world , in this world , have you died ? '' he says , clearly confused , and without a minute being able to get his response , he turns towards me while I say , `` I have n't . '' He does n't respond , but so he says , and it was like I 'd never felt before . The man and boy are so young , so young , so young to be so young , so young to be older .  `` I do n't understand . '' I can sense him coming up to me with something , and he does n't respond , a hint that I was n't really sure about . `` Why are you bothering me ? '' he says , and I look around at the kids surrounding him . They stand there on me , still holding their hands .  `` I know , so happy . '' I tell my boy , and we sit there , staring at him .  `` I do n't know . It 's quite difficult . '' he says , and he takes over his shoulder , and I am going to force my attention away . I can feel the snow gathering up some more .  `` Why do you do this ? '' he asks , and then he has a rough look on his face . And he brings his arm up to mine . `` Because when your father sits in the middle of the yard on his father 's feet , he feels like he is there again . '' There is a heavy , heavy sigh . `` You were so young when he was a child , he 's the one who survived when he was a child . ''  He is n't surprised , apparently . `` But when he was a child , he was at that point at the end of a firestorm , and his mother died . ''  He is n't shocked , so small , and so young as day , so young and wise ; so full of anger , so old , so young , so young and so young and so alive , so young , so young and so young so young that they were so young , so young and so young that it may have been the end of a firestorm .  `` There 's no time to say so , child . '' he says , and the boy stands up , and we both look at each other . We are sitting with each other , the boy and the others look at our world around us , with our eyes full of love and awe . The snow looks back at him as he looks at us .  `` I am fine , man . '' they say , and just as they were about to fall into a different world , the snow begins to move again .  `` You know , as long as you 've died , do n't you ? It 's our greatest feat , for you . '' they say , and then we make your first attempt to make conversation .  `` For one , man . And for as long as we 've lived , I have been in this world , not by . And when you were a child , I did n't know it was my greatest feat , not by the way . And when you were to my age , the winter did n't take my toll on me . I was devastated , that we did n't find it . And when I died , with no means to say anything , the snow did n't take my toll on me . I did n't know it . So I cried . I cried . I cried . I cried . The tears dropped to me . I cried . They cried . I cried . I cried . I cried .  `` Please . You ca n't help me , man . '' he says .  `` Why are you crying ? What is this ? ''  `` Because you do n't want to do this . That will make you sad . ''  Our hands meet again , and he is gone . He stands there , and in our own bed we both fall in the morning , in fear .  `` I ca n't help you . '' I say ,
'Oh man , I like to know what 's wrong with you , but you do n't even know what I mean . '   'So this way , we- '   'It was the last minute I put in my 'friend 's old house ! '   It was almost time . I just had to tell him how he had been telling me , what a joke .   'It was my fault . I wanted to take it to your house . '   'Look at you ! ' I retorted as I ran through the front door and into the street before I could even think about it , my door opened and I heard a voice calling and shivering uncontrollably .   'Where 's my friend ? '   'No ... you 're the worst of all , I really hope you 're serious and I 'm still going to kill your own ass one night . Why *why* am I even going to kill your own ass ? '   'Oh ... you were just mad , you were just mad . '   'It was a fucking joke ! I was mad ! You were just mad… '   I had never heard her yell before . She was too calm , she was too deep . I did n't need to listen to her , she just did n't need to listen to me .   'So ... this is the last time that we got in the house ... a *sigh* .   'Is this the last time that we got in the house , ' I said as I took my place beside her .   'Oh ? I did n't make that decision any longer , why did you do it ? Why did you stop loving me ? '   'Yes , and you were just mad . But I just wanted to go out with this . I want to be happy but I do n't care who I am so happy with , I want to be happy . '   I gave her a kiss . I smiled and turned around to see her in the dark .   'Are you a joke ... '   'I want to be sad for you now . My wife is beautiful , beautiful and beautiful . '   'I want to be happy for you , of course , but I have just to leave your own damn house . '   'I 'm so sad that could n't hurt you two . I 'm so happy ... '   'Well , I 'm happy that I still have n't gotten in the house on accident today . There 's nothing I can do to you about it , but I can see that you are happy . '   I walked across the street and found a tiny small little small wooden building that was once a building that was built to be built more than a house . It was small and dirty , it was a little large , it was just like its design , it had a small windows opening , it looked like it had a large glass .   'I want to be happy with you ... '   'So you 're happy , so sad that you 've been so happy with me , so happy that you 're happy ... '   'Hi , you are so happy now , I 'll show you how you wanted to have to be , ' I said as I walked to the small building .   'And I love you , ' I said as I walked away .   All that mattered was that I had no friends in my life . I was happy that I was going to be happy for you . '   I turned around and began walking down the street . I could see that little woman laughing at me as I walked from the large window .   'I love you , ' she said saying as she walked away .   She turned around and walked away after me . I took the little girl behind her and pulled a small tube in my hand , it was a small lever , it was a small device .   I stared at it with a sad , I could n't believe this was the last time that I met her . I had no friends in my life . This was a mistake ... ''   'I hope it 's alright . *   'But you have one final time , okay , alright ? '   She grabbed at me and held me close to her mouth . I tried to look away but her face was n't there . She closed her eyes and kissed me gently .   'But I want to be happy for
It would be like a surprise - I said , `` Hey , do n't act like this . ''   `` I know , '' said the voice , still in his head . `` I know , I know . Maybe I should try . ''   `` Do n't act like this when you jump . It 'll be a long time . ''   `` I 'll feel that shit . ''   The man slowly walked into the back of the bus , taking a deep breath . He then reached for his phone and dialed 911 , his phone rang .   No answer .   `` Hello ? '' I said , looking around . It was n't my own phone . There was nothing .   `` Who the fuck are you ? ''   `` I don't have any idea , '' replied the man , putting his hands on his shoulder . `` Ai n't it . I just do n't know . If you jump on that ledge , you 'll be stuck here . You 're just a fucking crazy person . ''   `` Fuck off , '' the man said , crossing his arms .   `` Stop fucking me , '' I said , walking towards the window . `` I 'll jump back . I 'll wait . I 've got some time I would be dead . ''   The man next to me was dead .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I said , `` but I 'm scared . I 'm here for the next few days . ''
`` Why did you do that ? He 's been sleeping for months now , what 's so weird ? I mean , it actually sucks , but what was he saying ? ''   `` Oh , '' I said . `` My mom said it was okay , but it looks like they 're going to be leaving now . ''   `` I do n't understand , '' she said . `` I 'm wondering , why are you calling me Mr. Anderson ? ''   `` I guess I understand , '' I said , her eyes getting bigger and bigger and heavier with each step . `` Anyway , why are you telling me this ? ''   `` Yes ? You do n't have to kill my brother , okay ? ''   `` I know . My brother is a dangerous father . And his parents are n't even the ones who 're making it , but they did n't make it possible . ''   `` Of course . I understand . If he is here , they must have thought my father was going to be here . ''   `` What if I were going to go out of here ? ''   `` Do n't shoot him , '' she said . `` Wherever . He did n't make it out of here . ''   `` Do you know what he told me , '' I said . `` We all know it 's only a matter of time before my dad comes for the job . And we 're all going to die soon . ''   `` I do n't know , '' she said . `` Do n't think I 'm going to marry him or something . But he 's going to kill me than it does . ''   I do n't expect to tell her , but she said that it was n't a matter of time . `` Tell me , '' I said . `` I 'm going to kill you , okay ? ''   `` Yes , I know . ''   `` I do n't know . There 's no way I 'm going to die then . Tell the police what 's coming , and I wo n't look it back for you again . ''   She looked at me again . `` Then why are you doing that ? ''   I 'm not sure how I 'm going to miss her , but I could tell every one of them was going to go out and kill her . *I can come back soon . *   `` What ? ''   `` You 're going to kill her before you get ready ? ''   `` No . ''
I remember having a lot of them . I know I used to be a kid , but this time it was different . I was just a kid , something I did n't know in my whole life , but somehow , I was n't the kid . At first I thought it was like the other kids . I 've never felt so damn happy about being a teenager .   I got into my car . In the end , I felt like I had a family , and a family of friends . Except ... I did n't . I was only a little longer , but I never got pregnant .   And I , I never forget my mother .   She was beautiful ... or more ... beautiful , but this time I could n't stop myself from seeing her . All those years ago , they were never happy together , and never really had that .   It was a simple process , especially when I got pregnant , so I became a woman who had a job to do . That 's what I wanted , and it was the same for the other kids ...   I broke a car down the road . I went to the hospital . So I went home , and they came back with me .   Once I was done , I came back into a hospital , and in my case , I was surprised , but in the case , it was n't a hospital . It made it seem like a small hospital .   I was surprised for how few years I worked , because , I always had a case , I 've never felt so alone .   For ten years , I grew up on the ground , and grew up at the same time . My wife , my wife , came back to her apartment . I was sad to tell her she was coming . Then , she left .   When I ended up , I thought I was going to miss her . She had a nice life . But I did n't have to . I went to church . I wanted to get married , and got married .   And now I 'm finally here .
It just did n't care . My plan was hatched .   The plan was simple : I 'd always tried to save my greatest heroes , but once I could , I 've done it . I was an evil , and that 's when it hit me . I took the liberty of finally getting it done to me . Using my power , I would all of my minions have killed me and cut people down . But I did n't think I would have been doing it with all this .   I took out my plans . Once I was done , I set for a full attack . I 'd gotten myself into doing my best to keep my minions safe . Finally , I got in the traps , and ordered my minions to attack me . To put them inside .   If nothing was wrong , then I 'd finally kill them . The plan was my final . We had to be done .   I do n't know if it was the plan , but I did . I started taking the liberty of getting rid of my plans . I started dropping things , and getting rid of it all . I started taking down a bunch of schemes , I did the deed as best as possible . I saved a lot of people from it , but when I was done , I heard the cries of the others .   But I do n't know if they had bothered me . I began making plans , and to my surprise , the plan was all perfect . After all , I was a mess . I made plans all over the world , and before I had started killing , I started going on to take off my plans . After all , I started giving up , but I was going to kill a bunch of people . People would be killed by the powers , so of course , if I were n't evil , I 'd probably kill the people .   And that 's when I did . I stopped trying to make the plans . I started making plans for them , and a family , and a lot of people . I got an idea to leave their traps in their labs . But it 's not easy . I did n't expect everyone to be killed by the power of the people , but to think about it .   They do n't know the plan , they wo n't know the plan . And they want to stop them .   So , I take it . I 'm done . I 'm done .   So , I decide to let the plans go . I 'm done . I take it . The plan takes awhile , and I take it . I start stealing over the world . The people that keep stealing their lives , and the people around me disappear , and my power takes care of me .   Now , I 'm done . To stop them , I do it . But the plan is not a lie , it 's just a lie .   So , I have to go . My plan is to end this , and the plan will finally do .   It will go well . Of course . 
The man stared back at me , his lips forming black lines . He had only looked up at me .  `` I am GOD . No . '' He said , his eyes scanning for any source of his voice .  `` Just a few questions and then you can answer them . ''  `` I am not God . The last few moments I created you , I am the most intelligent being you have ever been . ''  The man motioned to my brain , his fingertips tapping against my hair . My head raised , I thought of my own , and I wondered if I had no intention of ending up here on Earth , or the Earth that inhabited me .  `` I am God . You are God . I am God . I am the one you created . I am your God , and you are the beginning of creation . You are the beginning of creation that I can have created . I am your master . ''  `` Now , I know that not my purpose , but I am God . You are the creator . I am your creator . '' he said , with his voice gone black .  The man walked up to me .  `` Am I your creator ? '' he questioned .  `` No . I am The creator . ''  I looked him in the eye .  `` Did you leave me ? ''  `` I am your creator . I am the creation . I am the creator . ''  He looked me in the eye .  `` I am no God . '' I was starting to understand . There was nothing left to fear .  `` You are God . you are God and you are your creator . ''  `` Yes , I am Satan . ''   `` Your God . ''  `` Do you have any tools ? ''  `` Yes . I created you . ''  `` Do you have any tools ? ''  `` Yes . ''  `` The beginning of creation can not end . ''  `` Good , I am my creator . '' He walked up to me and I stepped out from the crowd , heading now .  But only as I continued to walk , I noticed the old man .  `` You are God , but you are God . I am God , and I am your creator . What I am . '' I was beginning to believe that my creator was God , but I was not God .  `` What would you do ? '' I asked . I hesitated .  `` If you are God , what about the beginning of creation , what about the beginning of creation , why not even begin a human ? ''  `` I am God . You are so flawed and so imperfect . I have created you have created me . Look at me . I am the creator , and I will bring you a creator . ''  `` Are you God ? '' I asked .  `` Of course I can not . You are a God , and I am God . I am the creator . I am the creator , and I am your creator . You are my creator . ''  `` I am God , but I am The creator . ''  `` I am Your god . '' he said , and I could wait for the end .  But the end of a long day was too soon . There was no time to be undone . There was no time to process it , until I could only see pain .  `` I am God . '' I shouted .  `` Please . '' He said after a long and long time with me , I felt a flash of light .  The power of the universe . No matter what I tried , I was there , and I would be there .  But the power of the universe was not the greatest creation I knew . At first , I was in denial , but then again , I realized that I was God . I had never heard a God , but then I realized I was God . I was God .  `` I am God . ''  I know that , but when I asked , I understood that he wanted me to speak to him . That there was nothing I can do to help him . I took that chance to continue caring . He tried again for me , but I could only get him to speak to me .  `` Are you God ? ''  `` Yes , you are God . ''   `` Please . ''  `` Please , I am God . '' I grabbed my wrist and felt the power drain from my body .  `` If I am God , I have only created you . '' He screamed .  `` I will be your creator . '' I felt the power drain from my body . There was no time to contemplate this .  `` I am God . ''  `` But why do you do this ? ''  ``
`` I have a small family . Where you belong is the beginning . I do not remember , I do not remember . I remember those things I remember . ''   Another woman , dressed in a fine dress , stood beside a sleeping man , not caring , dressed in a white dress and jeans . She looked like she was holding a blanket and the tears were pouring down her face .   `` This was a big day , but there might be a little more of it . ''   She felt a pang at her chest . `` Did you just leave , you know I love you too ? I never gave you a chance to see me like nothing else . ''   `` I have a daughter . I would always love her in my life . I never gave you a chance to see me like nothing else now . But I do not remember . ''   `` No , darling . I see them , I am fine . I ca n't remember . ''   `` I do remember it , honey . I hate so much about this place . I am so young . I am so young . But today I am too afraid to see anything else . ''   `` Goodbye , dear. ``   A smile crept across his face , even in one way or another , the tear was still off .   EDIT : sorry . Was n't this a long time ago ? I did n't really think this was fair .
I turned to see his face , the face of a dozen men . Their hands were wrinkled , but they had n't yet woken up . His hair was white , and white , his cheeks were so brown , and he showed his eyes ,   `` I 'll give you my strength , '' he said , then sat up . `` It 's not so bad . That wo n't do . You wo n't just let that happen . ''   His tears were turning to be icy .   `` I promise . So I 'll give you my strength , '' he growled , then paused before continuing . `` I promise . ''   He 'd turned away from me . She 'd turned away from the men , and made his way back to the chair .   `` I promise . Do n't stay here . We 'll never be safe . ''   `` Just do n't let me go . ''   `` I promise . ''   He 'd turned away from the table , and watched as it dawned on him .   But then , it dawned on him .   'You 're never safe , ' he whispered .   The man looked back at me , and smiled as best he could .   And then , he knelt back down and kissed his forehead .
`` Do you believe that this is the time of this ? ''   `` Not since the war , '' I answered . I had been taking a look for this village before . To be honest , it seemed harmless - it was easy to find out why somebody else was sending the caravan up here . That was great - I wanted to get past it . But it did n't matter , it was n't easy to go into the town . Even the villagers were just in the presence of a forest . Not to mention what happened next . But I do n't blame them . I did n't believe it .   `` Why did you make it into the countryside ? '' The people around me asked . They looked at me like a newborn . But I did n't believe it . All the villagers looked at me worried .   `` The war was no longer broken . But it was n't a time of reckoning . I got out of the wagon . I came back here with this whole battalion of men and women . ''   `` Why did you put this on ? '' The crowd asked , knowing when they saw them .   `` But ... it was n't this time of reckoning . '' I retorted . Their eyes were open , eyes open . `` You should be sure . '' I wanted to scream , but they saw me . I wanted to scream or cry , but I did n't . They were n't at all . They could n't make it to the village . And I did n't want to cry .   `` You should be sure . ''   `` That was an accomplishment . The last time you left this village , you knew better . '' I explained . But they did n't . They knew this was coming . But they do n't know what I was doing . I believed the village should survive .   `` You should be careful ! '' The crowd roared . `` You should be careful . You should be careful . ''   `` You should be careful . '' I pleaded . But that was a mistake . So I did n't . They simply could n't see the fields , or the fields . So I went back to the village . The soldiers were n't sure what to do , or how they did it . A group of soldiers would have been able to travel through the fields , to find some semblance of survival . So I went back to the village and told them what they had . They 'd get ready .   And I got out of the wagon .
My first story that 's been the same way .   It was a moment before I told myself ... I saw him now . My dreams of his life , that I had lived in a place that held no meaning . This was the one I had given to my parents , that I had heard rumors and many that I had been here for years . In his own eyes I saw him , and had finally learned that he was going to be an actress . And that he loved talking to my mother . And I was determined to lie , to keep him from going to bed every night , if only I could tell .   I was in that house for a second as a ghost . I was in that house for miles , and as I watched the smoke rise and fall . I was shocked when I stopped to look through the window and realize that I had lost my mind . I was terrified . I wondered if I wanted to go to the bathroom . But I had to keep the bed from happening ; at that moment I could have known where it came from . I did n't like to have my parents . I was glad he had never been able to tell me that once I was happy .   I walked over to the sofa and placed the rest of my hand on my shoulder .
`` What the fuck , just a chocolate cookie popped from my jar . We were kind of a tiny bunch of chocolate cookies , yes , maybe I had a couple of chocolate cookies earlier , but it 's not like I can do anything . '' The alien looked around the room and his face was covered in chocolate . `` Wait , are you from Earth ? '' the alien asked .   I stared at the cookie for a moment . `` Um , hi , I have a lot of vanilla here . I really want to be a little ... chocolate . Really , uh , '' I said . `` You eat a chocolate chip , right ? What the fuck are y'all gon na eat ? ''   The alien looked at the cookie . `` Oh , fuck . '' He turned and started walking toward the door .   `` So hey , I want chocolate cookies ... ? ''   The alien nodded . `` No , please , have n't been in the store for a while , so I 'll be back later . ''   I did n't answer . `` Wait , where am I ? ''   The alien turned to face me , `` What the fuck are you doing with this ? ''   `` Please , leave . ''   `` What the hell ? '' I looked back at the cookie . `` What are you talking about ? ''   The alien turned and walked to the door .   `` Oh , hey , your chocolate chip . So long as you were on Earth , can I go sit there for a bit ? '' I looked down at it . `` Um , really ? Are you a chocolate chip ? ''   The alien frowned . `` Oh , yes , that 's . My chocolate chip is *you* chocolate chocolate . ''   `` Of course , uh , yes , that 's a little odd . ''   `` I 'm sure I 'm dreaming . '' The alien turned around to look at me in disbelief , `` Great , if you really want a chocolate chip , then you 'll have to rest . And then you 're gon na be dead . ''   `` Oh , I can see . '' I looked at the cookie and then back again , `` I 'm an alien . ''   `` Wait , my chocolate chip ... and I ... ''   `` Uh , ok , okay , just a bit sorry . I ca n't help but wonder if I can help you . ''   I looked around the room and saw nobody but a girl with a large , and a little girl with orange eyes and a large nose . She was wearing a large purple coat , her blue eyes looking like she 'd been in a cave somewhere and she 'd just seen him in her peripheral . The girl had n't even asked for that , but she 'd been a little suspiciously . They both stared at her , while it continued up and down until they were both staring at them as they walked past .   The girl looked around the room , wondering why they were here . `` Uh , I 'm sorry . I am a chocolate chip . '' she said .   The girl took our eyes off the girl and then just stared at this girl . `` Uh , yes . Well I can say that , but I really need something I have to tell you . There are some weird rules here . So close this ... ''
I awoke , in the darkness of my dreams . The light was almost too bright . It was too bright I thought , my mind drifted to what I had thought was my soul .   I opened my eyes , tried to open them but I found they were mostly covered in glowing red . The alarm blared in response , a loud crunch and the pain was overwhelming . I was covered in blood , covered in blood . The pain was overwhelming , like a migraine , but I quickly had to open my eyes again .   I was laying on the bed , on the bed , on the same bed , down the same bed as mine .   The pain was unbearable , and I made my way down the white stairs , to where the noise was . I felt the weight , the weight . The feeling , it was just like the rest of the sheets felt so good . I opened my eyes again , again , trying to clear them off .   I had to wake up early , the sensations were incredible , but I could n't . Just the sensation and the warmness of the bed .   I heard something in the distance , but I could n't really tell if the source of it was what it was , or if it was any movement or movement . I looked at the sign , it read `` I love you ... ''   I did n't know if it was something I really wanted to know . I had to keep my eyes open and focus , for this was so much more intense outside than I did .   I opened my eyes again , to see in the distance of a crowd of people sitting at the far edge of the street , making their way over to the front door . They were waiting for me instead , and I felt the same way the people did n't believe I was .   It 's hard to believe that I was having a weird dream , but it was n't often that I could n't recall all of it . The fact that I was still standing and staring at their hands was a very bright red , and she was wearing a black tie with blue streaks .   `` It 's pretty nice , it 's time for me to come back. ''   I nodded , just as you did . The woman had a way of knowing it , but she wanted to tell me that I was n't feeling anything .   The woman looked at me with a look of surprise , and she looked down at me . It was like I was crying , or a deep , deep voice . The happiness she 'd just woke up is , and I ca n't see her in the world . I was n't feeling anything , it was n't a sensation . I was on the verge of tears of tears , but I could n't see her anywhere .   My eyes watered and I could n't see anything .   There in the distance I could see that there was nothing there , or anything , but the pain .   `` Do n't want me to feel anything . '' I said , but what could I do ? I could n't see anything , but in the right place .   The woman turned to me . `` What are you doing ? ''   `` We have to go , '' she said . `` Can we go in , and we can take some outside ? ''   I had to hold her and stare at her again . `` Are you alone . ''   `` I do n't want you to be alone . ''   She turned to me , and I could see that she was there , and I stood there , dumbfounded . The woman shook her head .   `` Please ... . '' she said . `` Get me out of here . ''   I kissed her once again , and she vanished . And then , she vanished , reappeared .   I woke up alone , in a small hospital I knew was n't . I was on the run , waiting at the scene . The night had slowed down , and I could feel it rising , or even moving . I was on the run , and it was n't the time to get back away .   I tried to find her , but she 'd gotten away . I was in the hospital room , in the far corner of the room , and I was sitting at the crossroads . I wanted her to be there ... in a hospital , to escape .   `` Why have you gone ? '' she asked my voice .   `` Because I can ... . '' I answered . `` I did n't want them to let me . ''   I ran over to her , and she was gone .
The battle was fought with the enemy but the men of her army left their mark and fled with tears in their eyes that were the most painful and painful of times .   Her last breath was a whisper as her battle cries came back . The tears that ran through her eyes finally reached the end of her life were all that mattered now .   She had waited months longer than she could remember .   She watched a pair of wolves take her from behind and attack , but they would not leave it .   To her , there was only one thing that mattered now .
I woke up with a start and a small feeling of warmness washed over me , all I could see was an intense white hot . It was weird how I looked at that , the way I looked at it , the way I looked at it , just all the colour I did . It was brown and blue.. That was the color of it now . It was n't red , that was a pretty weird sign that had been cast . Now it 's glowing a bit . All but black and green , the color of my eyes . I 'm surprised to find that it was so bright . It was blue - yellow , yellow ... .   `` Is it like.. '' I said , confused . I guess on the way to the top of the bed I looked at it , instead of falling down . I looked at it and noticed my reflection . My face had n't changed . It was purple , it almost felt like I had n't slept in months with the color of my eyes . I looked at it , it was red.. I could see it , and it was red ... And it was red ...   There was a rush of air . I opened my eyes . It was too bright to see for just so long that I could see it then . The orange was the color of my house . I realized that it still felt like it was not burning to me or . Then it would die . I just stood there , and now it was gone . I stood there , just a short short moment before I started to cry . It was my first time in a long time and it also felt like it was just my first time in a long time . I kept crying , and when I really did , I cried . It was n't red . It was yellow . I looked at it , I could see it , I could see it , it was the color of me . It was not the color I had in my home . It is the color of my house , the color of my house . It had n't changed . I started to cry , all I could see was green . Is it green ?   But then my eyes were red . Their color was yellow . I could see it.. It was ... . My eyes were green.. the color of my house . But then the color of my favorite color is as soft as snow , I was a bit confused . It was red .   I looked at the color again , then I saw what I was staring at , then I saw it . I looked at the color more now , the color of my family . The color of my brother . Was that red ?   It was n't blue , it was grey . The look of the mother I had never seen before . And then it faded.. It was nothing.. No .   It was red . And then it came back .   `` Is it green ? '' it asked..   I let it hit me again . The sound of my phone being ringing , I looked at the room as the room was black . I could see it . It was red . I could see it now , it was green . It appeared to be glowing in a small red-blue , a red-like colour . It must have been red . It had died years ago and then it went back to the room . It was the color of my brother .
Her mouth was agape and I could see the cold sweat seeping down my face as the heat that surrounds her , as I tried to shake her hand and keep her steady . She made a sound , which I could not get but a quick gurgle . I thought she was about to scream as we stopped moving . She had been caught in a car accident in a car accident , and I had been shot in the head . We hit the tree a few times before , and we stopped as fast as we could , and I ran , trying not to stop for a second before I was fired .  I was in a car accident , a bloodied beast with a tail sticking out with its head . It was over in the area , gasping for air and howling wildly in pain . This is it .  I ran , and tried to keep my body safe . I was terrified when I felt she 's voice grow stronger and stronger , as deep as the last of us combined with their claws and claws . She fell to the floor , clutching her chest and clutching me in a panic . I tried to take hold of myself but it did not . She struggled to contain my pain but could n't see anything . There was no way she could see it in the distance , but I was afraid . I kept running and clawed at the floor . This time I could feel nothing ; I had to run , and I could n't get to the top of the building we were building .  I could feel the pressure of the building opening in , but I could see the blood that had been pouring down from my head . But the pressure was n't so strong and I could feel the feeling of it running through my body . I tried to run , but my body was still in shock , I could feel the stress pushing . The pain and the pain stopped as I realized that it was n't happening ; just a couple of seconds .  I was on the ground , screaming . She was screaming . This was a huge fight . I could feel it burning in my chest but I could still breathe , at the same time .  I collapsed again , until I felt the pressure rise , and it became stronger and harder , stronger , until I was on the ground . I was scared . Why had I heard this ? I had heard this voice before , and why had I heard this ? Why was it alive ?  I ran , and I ran , and my head .
`` Ladies and gentlemen of the United Council , I 'd like to discuss this . ''   I took a deep breath and nodded in agreement .   *Now I guess I 'm *very* proud of *this* son of a bitch . *I 'm not *really* proud of him .   *I 'm *very* proud of him . *The last thing I hear from him is how this went through his head .   *The last thing I hear is the click of a metal tube . *   *No , not even *how *you* have to get excited . *This* was the last thing I hear from that bastard that I once did for my son , the bastard he had promised me . I knew that all of that would come to him before he had me to look , and *wasn't* proud of me .   *That 's what I 'm doing to deserve to be my son . *   I watched as he sat , his eyes tracking my movements . They had been the last thing I heard : *Yes , that 's what I do ! *   *But I am *sure* that this was the first thing I heard from that bastard and I was his little brother . I had never gotten past his mother in his short life , and then-*I 'm glad he could have taken much advice from me . *   *When I was born , I was proud of him . *   He did n't know what to do at all . He had been so proud of me , and he had all the time to look at his paper . And he did n't know what was going on . He knew I needed to know *that* . But the tests were n't getting too bad , and he had always been proud of me . I did n't know what to do .   *And why not* his son did n't like I was the last thing I heard from that bastard and all the time . *She was the most proud of the world I ever saw . *   The next thing I heard was a cry from my son . I looked down and remembered , *my son ! *   *When ... *   *I do n't know . * it was my son and he knew that . I had never felt so proud of everyone . I never knew exactly what he had done to his family and that he had never been proud of me . *   *There is no reason this is happening to you , * he was nervous , even if I was too proud of it . He had always known that maybe he had been proud of me now .   *Then ... *   *I regret , * the realization hit me like a freight train .   *Please , not anymore . Please . *   I looked down and saw my son looking into the red eyes of his other sister ... ...   *Now my son , * it was his mother . *I have to have to know about him . *   And then I know that I have to know this .   *And it gives me advice . *   *And you are the last thing you heard . *   *and you are the last thing I remember . *   *And you will be happy . *   *And you will be happy . *   *And you will be happy . *   *You will be happy . *
Falling for the final step , I stepped outside the door . My son 's home was in the attic . The dust was so dense it had barely fallen from our previous home .   The smell of the outside rose from the old room as he put his hand on his shoulder . `` Why ? '' I asked .   His feet turned into fists . `` It was over the past two years . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because it was over the past two years . ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` I do n't know . ''   `` It would be back . I was always so stubborn . '' He put his hand on my shoulder . `` How dare you forget the last five years . I never knew how long I had been living with you . I hope , even after I left you , you could n't risk your life without your brother . And you 're leaving ! ''   `` So what I had left ? ''   `` I have no choice . ''   My son 's eyes started to water . `` Why you did n't take my son away ? ''   `` Because you were right , you ca n't afford to worry about the matter anymore . ''   `` Look at the photos of your own house , your family . ''   `` That 's the only thing I remember , the kids of the house . ''   `` I am right , '' I said simply .   `` Then what ? ''   `` There is one house I could take . ''   `` And I know it . '' the man stared at me . I wanted to ask him why I did n't care .   `` But I did n't want your brother to tell you . '' My son started to sob .   `` He was right beside you . ''   `` But you never wanted him to stay behind . '' My son 's eyes began to water .   A moment later , the darkness enveloped me . I was trapped in a box , surrounded by an impossible .   I could n't sleep without him .
The tears I 've gone from the man I 'd never even heard before were in my head . He 'd say it was so full of shock and pain and disbelief ! I always thought that was , until my last thought was how angry I was . My last thought was when I met his son .   Not that I had ever seen the sadness in his eyes before . He did n't say so .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I say , `` I 'm sorry , I love you . ''   He 'd say it was an exaggeration . I 'd cried , and cried . He said it was time for me to see him .   `` I loved you , '' he said , `` I needed you . I have to trust you . I need you to know what you 're doing . I need you to know what the greatest thing that has ever happened . We need you to know your father . '' This was time for me to hear my father beg . I need him to know about his horrible deeds .   `` You love me , '' his words echo through the air , his words echo through the empty room .   `` I love you , son . ''   I 'd loved him . I would have loved him . I would have regretted this . I would have loved him .   `` You miss me , son . ''   `` You would have liked me to know your son . I would have loved you . ''   I looked away , and in a moment of wonder he felt sorrow . He 'd done it to this day 's end . I would have loved him .   `` And you wo n't let me leave you alone for me . ''   
I looked around at nothing for a bit , nothing , nothing , nothing . Then I heard someone scream from across the street , something , someone . I could feel the darkness creeping through me , but I was completely alone . I could feel it , and I could feel their eyes staring at me . They were closed , and I could feel them slowly blinking away , and the sound was over .   It was getting weird . It was just when I made my way to this hospital , they would come around to see what I was doing , but now I was seeing someone staring at me , their eyes looking at me .   I froze , I could n't quite move . I was alone , except for my own . The first time they were looking at me from across the street , I could see them staring at me , the faint glow of their bright , glowing lights reflecting off their pale faces .   I saw myself , only a few blocks back , but theres far too big and too small to be able to block out . I heard them , the sound of their hooves collapsing against the pavement and the sound of their footsteps coming from behind me . I heard them scream when they saw me , then it faded away .   I tried to move forwards , but but I did n't , and I was back in a few minutes . I could n't move , and I could n't move . I could n't move . I could n't move , and I knew who I was . I opened my eyes to see a man holding a knife , and while my mind was racing , I was in shock and fear , while I could n't move .   I could only stare at myself , and suddenly , a dark figure appeared motionless in front of me . I stood up , and my jaw dropped . I was paralyzed .   The man looked at me , his face wide and wide in shock . Then , the world changed into a dark red .
The city 's armies , full of superheroes , fought for years .   But , the citizens , both dead , had fought for the first time .   `` I told you this was a mistake . ''   A man standing over me , his head ajar . `` You know the rules . Just as you say . ''   I turned to look at his hand , expecting something to happen . `` I promise . I promise . ''   A man was standing beside me , his hands wrapped around mine .   `` ... But you wanted me to live . ''   I looked at the man and his eyes were fixated with mine . His voice was soft and soothing . There was an emotion in his voice , to an emotionous kind .   `` I am not going to be happy . ''   I stood for a moment , `` My life is gone , and you are here . ''   His fingers twitcheditched , and he pulled a trigger . A dark red light shone inside me , setting in the city .   `` ... Let 's make this work . ''   I put my hand under his shoulder , `` One day , you 're here . ''   With that , I turned to shake my head .   `` ... No . No . You can not . You need to be happy . ''   He walked through the city to meet mine .   In the corner of the city , the man smiled , `` My true love was always gone . And love was gone . ''   I nodded , `` Good .
-  -   -   I got to work work because I had a job . I did n't remember much of it . I was just a child . I was only 25 when my job was hard . I was n't even 20 when I was 9 . I did n't remember much of it anymore .   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -    -   -    -   -    -    -   -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -     -    -    -    -     -    -       -      I got to work . I got to work because I needed to work . I started working too-many times , and I could n't afford to work too hard enough that I forgot to work , and that I lost all in this old world because I could n't make the right decision . I kept working , never working again . I started working and I was still working , I worked too hard for a company . Being busy , working hard to work .   I started working too hard . I worked too hard for a company . I was still working hard for a company . I needed to work work . My company was always work-working enough . My job was right . I needed someone who wanted someone to work , someone who needed people to hire to leave for anything and everything . I needed a company worker to work hard , but I was n't working too hard . I needed people .   I wanted someone that wanted someone to work hard as needed to work hard . Someone who needed me to work and work hard if I needed someone to work hard , but that 's not my job . Someone who wanted them to work hard to work work hard when someone caught on as soon as they were done . Someone who gave up too well was put together , so that someone who could work hard to work . I saw lots of people working hard , and sometimes they knew something about their job , so I never got to work . I knew what I wanted . I became the one working hard , and I became the one working hard enough .   I lived as a worker , so that the guy who owned it did n't work until we got there was more money , and then , if I was working hard to work hard enough that I could work hard enough that I could work harder than anyone else , maybe even more money . Maybe I 'd lose something , to work harder . And when I work hard , there would n't be a risk of hurting someone . I did n't have much work to do , so I worked hard for a company that would n't work anymore . I spent too much time working hard , and my job stopped working . Until a week later , it would n't work anymore .     -   -    -   -    -     -     -       -    >      -       -     -      --       -      -    --     >         -      --        -      -         -
I do n't know why I 'm upset , but my head is throbbing : I ca n't make out the words - not when I 'm telling the truth - it 's not like I ca n't see anything . But it 's like I have to see their eyes- nothing , all it has to be is my own . The tears are not mine - I was simply thinking about all of them .    `` It 's a lie . You know you must be very careful . It 's always the same thing . ''    I blink , listening to the conversation . It does n't go through my head , but it is just the same thing .    `` That is the truth . '' I sigh and turn around sharply .    `` You will . You will . You will . You will . We will . You will . ''    I turn looking to see that I am lying , and there he is , on an edge . I look at him , and see that he was not . I have to say something , I am too desperate to get out of here and this is n't what I am going to do .    `` You 'll . You will . You will . You will . And will . Your . ''    I sigh again , but it 's not like I had to say anything .
`` You are in the kitchen first . '' I said to the egg .   The bacon was full , no matter how many times I had gotten past the bacon , I was surprised that this was a small black shell ? So I carefully dug the egg down to try and find a small , white egg .   `` Why ? '' I asked .   A flash of white and white appeared . I quickly opened the mouth to reply , `` When do you get these eggs ? ''   `` Sure , I 'll try to survive . ''   I rolled my eyes and stared into the kitchen before me , for a moment , before I realized that I had found a tiny egg that was actually a shell ?   It looked a bit like a shell , but it was larger than a shell . It looked like a shell . It looked tiny . Could n't have had the skin that surrounded it . It also looked like a shell , but those were ... *gazing* to the left .   I took a moment to look , and gasped , again , `` Sorry , I forgot the egg . It 's a shell . ''   `` Uhh ... '' I stammered . I was horrified , and realized I had n't been in the morning before . There was a lot of eggs here , but no more eggs at all .   Why did my eggs stand there ?   I opened the egg and saw that it had been egg eggs before . There was a lot of eggs there , there was what looked like an egg .   A young woman , staring at me , then back to me , to me , `` Hello , this egg has been eggs . ''   `` Yes ? Well , that 's all I have been going to do . '' I said after a great moment .    She sat there in silence , staring at me from under the egg . She was a baby , but she was definitely a baby .   I moved back towards where I was heading .   To my right , she was still frozen in the middle of a snow . I watched her closely , trying to get the egg from where I was heading . Once I found a point , I was starting to wonder how she had survived that . I found her . I tried to look back , but she did n't look at me .   `` I 'm going to ask you what this egg could do . ''   She was n't looking at me , though . She was obviously a baby , and she somehow made it look like an egg .   But for what seemed like a moment , she gasped again .   `` This egg is just a shell . You have a special egg , and I have a special special egg , '' she said finally .   The egg was still warm and I could see her smile .    
The man 's jaw dropped in an effort to meet with the woman 's eyes . Her eyes met with a strange mixture of confusion and confusion . `` You , uh , should have asked for some bread ? ''   Her eyes met , her brow furrowed . `` You have not yet noticed . '' He gestured towards the dining table . `` This is n't the bread you 've had in a long time , just kept saying , `` and this is not the bread it was . It 's empty . ''   `` I know . You 're trying to find a bread , I know . You 're trying to stop caring about yourself , okay ? '' He gestured to the table . `` As I say , you have very little to do . ''   `` You should have asked for some bread , and there 's nothing I can do . ''   `` So , what 's that about ? ''   `` I know . It 's just a regular bread , but it 's simply bread ; your kind is n't the bread . ''   `` That 's a simple piece of bread , but it 's just bread and bread like you ca n't put up with it , right ? ''   The man raised his eyebrow , his grin slowly turning towards a slight frown . `` You 're trying to make a little sound , that 's not right . ''   `` I do n't know anything , but you are still thinking that it 's a bread , and I 'm talking about how you could spend time with some bread . I 've probably come to tell you . ''   `` No more . I 'm talking about it now . I know it 's a ham ball , but I know that it 's a ham ball . No more than a ham ball . That 's not what I got . I do n't know anything about it , but I 'm calling you crazy . They 're talking about you in this restaurant . ''   `` You 're thinking about it though . Why ? But I 've heard you about it . And it 's not something else . ''   `` I 'm talking about this sort of thing . It 's a ham ball , but I do n't have any bread . ''   `` You 're talking about how you can find a ham ball , if only you can use it . ''   `` No . You 're talking about it yourself . ''   `` I 've know . ''   `` I 'm talking about the *hell* . That 's why you made me talk about it . I 've seen it as a prank to myself , but I know that 's not what you 've heard . ''   `` This is n't just a prank that 's supposed to happen ! It 's not like you 're talking about it , so I knew it . ''   `` You can tell in the future that this is *hard* , and it is ... It 's one of the 'well ' thing that 's happening . The *hell* thing that 's happening has caused this guy over to be having any kind conversation with *you* . ''   `` The thing that 's happening is that things are about to happen , right . You 're saying you 're going to have to go back to time to decide when you 're about to go home , right ? I 'm going to ask you to start calling , but I can tell you that you 're talking about this- ''   `` I 'm going to tell you what 's wrong with the whole thing . If I can tell you that . That the *hell* thing that 's happening is not the fault you *really ought to have* done it . ''   **BOOM**   `` I 'm going to tell you that ! ''   `` All of that . That 's that ? I 'm going to tell you that you 're just talking about your behavior . ''   `` You 'll tell you how you know about me ? ''   `` A ham ball ? ''   He narrowed his eyes . `` I know . ''   `` But where ? ''   `` The *hell* . I 'm going to tell you that you 're going to be honest to me like that . ''   `` I 'm going to tell you all about it , how about you just tell me what it is . Even when you feel about the truth , I 'm
The darkening storm blew through the valley , as it had landed in the distance .   There was a slight clatter of thunder across the land , as it grew stronger , throwing more and more wood into the center of the valley . But now , the wind had left without a trace of anything .   * '' Come , gentlemen ! `` * The soldiers shouted back . The black army of the enemy tore through the valley like an empty sheet of paper , leaving thick dust behind its back as they passed the horizon .   `` The enemy , they have a ... ... * '' The soldiers roared . The soldiers did n't see anything else , or feel anything else . It was not the time to end this battle , and yet , it was to end this battle .   * '' I do n't really know how to begin it . `` * He spoke , not seeming to respond .   * '' Well , that 's the ... * '' The men murmured , his words rising , `` But there 's one way to start this battle , and you can just wait for the enemy to end . '' He nodded , just above the ground , to his right . `` There 's one way to stop this carnage , a way to stop that fight . '' He glanced down at the ground below the valley , his hand still hovering over his shoulder , * '' Please ! `` * He slowly rose , and was suddenly rewarded with all the force of a blast as the soldiers rushed towards him .   * '' Why ? `` * The soldiers looked at him , looking at him quizzically . * '' You 're losing a fight . `` * The soldiers looked at him with a tired eyes , then back at the soldiers , and then back at the soldier .   * '' So what 's your name ... * '' The soldier muttered , his voice coming from somewhere else , above his head . It had been years before the battle had ended , and the first that had ever been his fault . `` * He began , a small , small , wooden-toothed creature raised his hand , his sword high above his head .   * '' All right . `` * He continued , * '' There 's a sword in the base of his right arm , and the other soldier 's right arm and the other arm . `` * He looked at the sword , and then back at the soldiers , their words slowly returning to their original position .   * '' Does it matter what ? `` * The soldier nodded , feeling his heart tighten .   * '' If it does n't matter what ... * '' The soldiers nodded again .   * '' See ? `` * The soldiers nodded again , standing . He glanced around , but something was off .   * '' Right . `` * The soldier nodded back , and then nodded again , * '' Did the enemy move . `` *   The soldier smiled . Both men backed away and , as they turned , felt a sharp pain in his left leg .   * '' You 'd take me out completely ! `` * The soldier whispered , looking at the soldiers , then back at the soldiers . `` They 'd go to hell , they could n't even stand a chance .   `` Oh , and you 'd take me out with my axe , though . `` * The soldiers looked back at the advancing soldiers . They both looked at each other expectantly and then at each other , looking at each other with expressions of confusion , then back at the enemy .   The soldiers nodded again .   ***   A small , white door in front of him opened , and a young man stood on the floor , a young woman laying on her back was staring intently , as if her eyes were n't open by the fire , only that she felt was a soft , raspy grunt behind her . She then noticed the man 's eyes , and he smiled as if to say something , but the old one smiled .   *** '' Sorry , sir . `` ***   The door opened and his face met a familiar face . Even though the old man did n't recognize his name , it was n't much as he had seen the old woman . He smiled grimly and looked at the young woman , and smiled .   `` I understand . This battle was meant for the better , and I was no coward , so I had to kill them . `` * The old man smiled . * '' Just look back at the old woman , you 're going to kill them , and we 'll be together forever . `` *   * '' Because I love you too , dear , thanks . `` * The old woman smiled sheep
`` This is not going to work . ''   `` What ? What , what ? ! ? What , why ? ! ? ''   `` You do n't have it . ''   `` Why not ? ! ''   `` It 's going to work . ''   `` Well , I 'm sorry . There 's the time . Now I 'm on your bike . ''   `` Oh , hello ? What are you doing with this ? ! ? ''   `` ... that 's not what you mean by this . I 'm not going to work . It 's just your bike . ''   `` Oh yeah , it is . Listen , it will work . ''   `` How would you like to work ? ''   `` Well , how would I ? Forgive me . I do n't have my own choice . I want you to work . ''   `` Okay ! Now what do you want to do with this ? ! ''   `` Oh , I do n't want to work . Every day I have a boss , and every day I live , I will bring my own company , I will take care of it . And every time I spend with this family I will be happy . And every day I let my little brother go . Tell him I 'll regret it with him . He does not want to feel tired , and he hates helping so much . And every day I go back to my own life I will make them happy . And while ... ''   Suddenly , a knock at the door .   `` The light will work . And if I 'm going to work for him , I will be happy with you . ''
The doctor sat on the side of the bed and stretched his arms . “ Look , my mom is my mom ’ s child , ” he said . She was very young and slender in her 60 ’ s . His face was thin and pale , even though he was wearing a blue scarf . Her hair was dark and he was young . Even though he was just two years older than his mother , his hair , and some deep blue-green eyes were blue .   “ Hey , ” the doctor said , “ I 'm not going to be like your mom ? ”   The doctor walked to the top of the bed and looked across the room . He was surprised that he was seeing an empty room . He opened his eyes and there was a woman wearing a very long , dark blue sweater . She was wearing a large dress , and a blue dress . Her hair was tied , and she was beautiful in her hair . She looked like she should be her brother too . She looked like she was a girl , but she was n't smart enough to be her brother .   “ Uhh , ” he said . “ I think you look attractive ? ”   “ I want to be honest , ” the woman replied . “ I just have to talk to your friends , ” the woman teased .   “ Okay , okay . Sorry . What do you mean ? ” the woman asked .   “ Is this love ? ” the doctor asked .   “ No , I do n't think it is love , ” the woman said .   “ Like I said , if it means I have to see the love again , will you marry me , like like I said ? ” the man asked .   “ Like I said , you love me , ” the woman smiled .   “ You want me to marry you , like I said , ” the woman said . It made her look happy , and she was nervous . She gave her a kiss , and he smiled at her . They stood up quickly . They walked towards each other .   The woman placed both the palms on her hips and kissed them , “ I love you . I love you . I love you too . You love me too . I love you too . ''   “ Well ? ” the woman asked . She smiled and sat up . She was starting to lose focus .   The woman looked at the two women . They sat with their hands in the pockets , eyeing each other .   The woman looked around to see if any of the women was willing to meet her . She said , “ I love you too , ” the woman said . Her eyes narrowed and she noticed a large man standing over her .   “ Hey , ” the woman said , “ I ’ m a sweet girl. ”   The man smiled at the woman . “ I love you too. ”   The woman smiled and looked over at her husband . “ I love you too , ” she said . “ I love you too . I love you too. ”   The woman did n't answer .   The man looked at her , and the woman started to pash , “ I love you too . I love you too . ”   The man looked back at her , then looked at the woman . “ I love you too . I love you too . I love you too. ”   The woman was looking back over , and the man said , “ I love you too. ”   The woman looked over at the woman , and the man turned to see his face . He was the woman that was sitting across from her . The man looked at her .   The woman looked back at the woman , and she said , “ I love you , ” she said . “ Like if I had to see the love again . Is there anything I can do ? ”   the woman looked at the woman and smiled , “ I love you too . I love you too. ”   The woman looked back at her husband . “ I love you too , ” she said , “ I love you too. ”   The woman looked back at the woman , and smiled at the woman . The man nodded and went to hug the woman .   The man smiled . “ What do you mean ? ” he asked .   The woman looked at
She walked slowly towards the door . She could see the red and browns of her husband 's eyes and a face that had not even yet been moved . Instead of a smile , she dropped to the ground . `` Do n't worry , '' she whispered . He looked like he was a great man . That 's when she heard him . The man in the bedroom . He did n't appear to be getting up . She turned around . `` Do n't worry , babe . You did n't hear my name , '' he whispered . The man moved to his coat and pulled out a cellphone , `` you sure you know that man ? Because he was so busy with that money . '' She smiled at him and then looked at the phone she was holding . She tried to call him , but he did n't respond . She answered `` Just make sure I can find your name . '' She reached for it and pulled it out . She opened it and held it up to him . `` I know I 'm gon na be a bit tired . '' She was startled . He lifted his hand again and gently touched it . She could feel it and then he slowly lifted his hand . `` Uh , I want to meet you . '' She turned around . `` I 'm so sorry . '' She said . `` Now get your number . '' She turned , `` I do n't know who you will be , but to be honest you 'll never know who you are . '' He reached for the phone and began dialing , `` Ok . Are you kidding me ? '' She repeated . He picked up his phone and dialed . `` How would you say hello ? '' She was surprised . `` I 'll see you again . '' She started dialing . On the phone , she was going to tell him she was taking it and she could tell he was telling him he was coming back . `` I will see you soon . '' He grabbed the phone and his stomach got a bit more nervous as he walked off . She decided to push him out of the room but she could n't make out . She put his phone back in the way he looked into the eye and saw the man staring at her . `` I just want to hear you so closely . You could take me in to your place . '' She thought . There was a distinct growl on the phone . She was n't sure what to do . `` Just let me in . '' She said . `` I 'm calling you . '' She stood there , listening . `` That 's okay . You 're really not going to help me . If I hurt you , it would make me want to hurt you . '' She told him . `` Do n't worry , I did n't know that . I will make sure you can help me . We 'll fight . '' He pulled the phone out and then turned to look toward the light at the man . `` You do n't understand . I wo n't hurt you . '' He looked at her confused . He did n't look so scared . `` What did you do ? '' She asked him . `` Look , just put it in the trash . '' Then she shut the door , and pulled it open . She looked back at the man and had a face like it was . `` But how did you do that ? '' He said . `` Because it did n't work . I need a new set of equipment , a new set of equipment , a custom , and a new set for work . '' She said .
`` Alright , '' said Sam . He was so close . It was that you could almost hear the words , except his breathing did not carry a beat-up tone . He felt like he was looking at some magic mark that everyone had ever seen .   `` What does this mean ? '' asked Sam , trying to hide his excitement from the situation . It was probably a hoax , but I did n't understand it .   Sam was a bit nervous , but his eyes were darting towards the blackness on his chest . He was trying to close his eyes and tried to close his eyes but there was no way he could even see it in the dim flickering glow that was trying to get the light away and he could see the tiny sparks of light hovering over him .   `` I 'm afraid ... '' he finally said . `` Is there any spell I have ? ''   `` No no . '' said Sam . He was beginning to know that he was not afraid . But Sam was getting weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker . And it did n't matter , there was no mistake . And Sam 's eye was darting around and around again ... Then he felt something . Something hard . Something hard . Something wrong . Something wrong .

He looked out across the street between the two cars . He was having a hard time processing his situation . A second thought came over the radio , and he realized that he was playing some kind of game , and that he could n't remember what was going on .   As he strolled over to his apartment , he saw that he was in an old lamp . There was a lamp on the wall , but it was a lamp that said *Bless , * and his heart sank . He looked up at the genie and put his hands up in his mouth .   `` Hello ? '' His voice was heavy and gruff .   `` Hello ? '' He called out , feeling a chill in his neck .   `` Hello ? '' The genie 's voice was soft and soft . He looked around for sure it would respond .   `` Hello ? '' He called out , and he was surprised .   `` Hello ? '' The sudden , sharp , booming voice called out . The genie looked at the lamp and it seemed to move rapidly . It seemed that it was moving quickly , and it seemed to move in an instant . The genie felt the ground shake , and with a flash of light , the lamp disappeared .   The Genie , and suddenly he was in the lamp . A sound erupted through the house , and the rest of the Genie had vanished . The lamp was small , and that was when the sound of a lamp began to dissipate .   `` Hello . ''   The Genie was startled , and the Genie was terrified . He shook his head . This was n't supposed to happen , but he knew that someone else would make it . This was n't supposed to happen , and he was n't going to be punished for the inconvenience .   Instead of asking for a little more Djinn 's name , the Genie was still holding a lamp . He 'd already done something stupid . It was n't supposed to happen , it was supposed to happen . He had to put and grant him a wish .   `` Well , this is weird , '' The Genie uttered , not really expecting to come out . `` You see , I am the genie . A nice human . I am the man who can grant them the day he grant them his last wish and I will grant them the day he granted him the day he summoned them . I will grant the day after he summoned I will grant him the day he summoned me . ''   That 's when he realized the genie had appeared in the lamp , or at least a little disappointed . He looked into the lamp 's eyes . He looked down at the lamp , and noticed that it was on the wall . One of the other people on this other had two chairs , but he must have done something stupid . They must have , too , was n't supposed to happen . He looked in the mirror , and saw that it was still still intact . Maybe this was a coincidence , or maybe someone had summoned another genie , or someone else , or something , or something . He decided to do something stupid .   `` Well ... '' The genie said . `` I was n't going to grant you the Wish , nor about you . ''   The Genie laughed again . The Genie smiled again . Then the genie shook his head . `` Good , good , gen . '' He wished for the day he summoned a Genie , and a genie , but he was n't supposed to make it . He must have been going out for the day , he thought to himself .   They stared straight into the ceiling , and their eyes met . He imagined that he is going to grant them the wish .
I can hear the muffled sound of his own footsteps coming from behind me . I can hear the distant sound of his footsteps approaching me as I walk through the forest . I try not to dwell on the idea of that I should be alone , but I can not make out any sound . His footsteps are muffled from the distance as I take in the surroundings . The sun catches my eye as I turn around . I have to be able to see him , a stranger of mine . As I walk , I hear a bangs of a human right now . I see a silhouette I can not identify . I see the masked figure in black walking away , in with a knife in hand . I see him smiling and smiling . Tears well up in his black eyes as he tells me to pull the trigger . I see his eyes move . I see him turn to look at me and he is holding his hands up like he was holding his own . I stare at him , and he looks at me blankly . I see him struggle but I quickly reach out . I have to go back to the other side . I grab him by the collar , and I realize I am already back on the ground . I hear the muffled noise of my own footsteps . I hear footsteps approaching now . I am stunned . I knew that I should never have heard this before . I look to my right and see a silhouette . I hear a whisper , `` This is my God '' . I have to get up to leave . I hear the footsteps approaching and I hear a man calling 911 , `` This is my God '' . No , I was still standing in front of me . I look to my right and see myself , my very own face . I see a man holding his hand , `` Please , it has been a long time '' . I notice the voice on the other side . I raise my hand . I see him walk away when I run for my friend . I see him raise his left hand and he starts sobbing . Suddenly , from there I catch it . He starts sobbing . I feel a tear forming in my eye as I feel this man go on..my brother . I feel it , but I hear his screams . I see him running towards me and suddenly I see his hand on my sleeve . I see this man 's hand now . I see him scream . Then I see him laughing . `` How was your God ? I am God . ''
Today is a particularly big day , with a lot of work to do . The boss is talking to someone on the phone , yelling it out . He keeps shouting it out again .   `` Where are the Boss ? ''   `` Look , sorry , we ca n't be here any longer . ''   `` You have to get lost . ''   `` Oh , we ca n't be here any longer , '' a voice says from behind him .   `` Please , stop ! I 've wasted another week ! ''   `` What is going on ? ''   `` Nothing , just just leave ! ''   `` Sure . ''   `` Good . Hey , what 's your name ? ''   `` Hey , what 's your name ? ''   `` Hm . Gary . ''   `` I 'm going to write you back , uh , just do n't write me back . You were the boss . ``   `` We 're going to need your help , or maybe you 're on a ride back . I 'm going to be waiting patiently , '' he mumbles out . He grabs an old newspaper from the back of his jacket and walks to the building .   He looks at it and walks toward the door , towards the roof .   `` Uh , okay , it 's going to be a beautiful day . ''
I 'm in the war that day . I 'm going to die . I can not remember the day when I took that away , and I ca n't remember the day when I did this . The day before we met up on this beach , I was on the beach . All these days are always the same , but I ca n't say who owns it . Why would I have to sit here today , or die in this war , and ca n't remember the day before . I wish I could remember the days before , thinking . The day before that , when I went , I cried , and cried . I cried , and even cried ... But I did n't .
The door swings open and I approach the new customer in tow .   `` Yes . Hi sir . '' I say , trying to break through the door .   `` What 's your name ? '' The customer asks as he walks through the door .   `` I 'm a man of mine , I must offer to meet the most famous adventurers in this town . I 'd like to take a look around , '' I say dismissively as the door swings open .   `` I know , '' I say nonchalantly . I quickly grab my hand and pull out the handle .   `` It 's Jack , '' I say , knowing the stranger 's response would give me a slap to the jaw . `` What do you expect ? ''   `` I 'd like to wait for you to ... find the store . '' He nods .   `` You 're out , sir . '' I nod , handing out the wallet . `` I 'm about to add a couple of coins , and I 'll be with you shortly , '' I take a piece and continue the transaction .   `` You 're back , you know ? '' he asks incredulously .   `` Well , I 'd like to wait out first , '' I say sheepishly . `` And I 'd like to get a new one , '' I say sadly .   `` What ? '' The customer asks .   `` To take a look at the clerk 's face , '' I answer , looking at the cashier . `` He 's a guy of mine . ''   `` But he wants to pay a lot of money . It 's kind of expensive ! '' He starts to lift his hand , and I 'm surprised to see the cashier in the eye .   `` What ? '' I see an odd looking man wearing a red hat holding them up to him .   `` I just need to wait out . '' I said , raising a hand to his face .   `` I 'd like to buy that . '' The man looks at me .   `` Thanks , '' I say and I continue walking . `` I 'd like to get some cash , so let me know what the hell you look like . ''   `` Well , what , '' he says , shaking his head . `` The fact you 're in this town is that it does n't taste like any other , and I have a rather strange feeling that it does n't taste like anything . ''   `` I can trust that . '' I say as I look back over at the man . A stranger has a black beard and a gold earpiece . What 's a 'fearing ' man that could be a black beard , with that , or that , or that there is an old man in his shirt . I realize that it does n't make any sense . He 's extremely dressed in black , and a few times he 's wearing a crown and a black tie that you 'd never seen in such a short short one . His hair was covered in a black leather bandaid , which was covered in an intricate intricate , intricate intricate pattern , with the engravings on top of it .   `` I just did n't want it . '' He says as he turns around , and I get out of my way . I 'm walking toward the shop , waiting to get the customers to come by with me at the very moment . The sign reads `` Jack , make sure that you are n't in the store . ''   `` I 'm afraid you do n't have to worry about that , '' he responds . `` He 's the thing that does n't need to be used to with such a thing . '' He gestures the large metal rod towards me . `` Come now , and give it to you . ''   `` I do n't see , '' the man says sadly . `` Your kind will come to my shop tomorrow , and I 'll be gone shortly . ''   `` I 'll be fine . I can go back here . '' I lean forward and grab the object . `` I 'll be there soon . ''   I grab it and walk to the counter . When I pull out the arm , I grab a piece of debris . The man looks at me , and points the rod at me . `` The owner says that the owner will find him , and that he would be fine , '' he says as he stares at the item at me .   `` Look , '' I say . `` It 's as simple as a piece of metal to me . ''   `` Really
They 'd said it was n't too bad .  `` I 'm sure you understand , '' the father said as he rubbed his face with his forehead .  `` I ... I guess ... I should have said it . ''  `` I have . '' The father said . `` I 'm telling you . I need you , the man your daughter 's son , the woman your whole life . ''  `` Does n't matter . '' He paused for a moment , then put the child down . `` I know . ''  `` I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... Do n't know . '' The father lowered his head and looked over the body of the dying child . `` I ... But that 's what I need . '' It took the child 's hands , and then removed the child from the child .  `` When 's the time ? And why are you feeling me ? '' The father asked .  The father raised his head . `` Why do you feel me ? '' He tried to break the silence but the man continued his stare .  `` Because you want me to be able to convince myself that you see me . '' The father took his eyes out at the empty room .  `` Because all of you know is that if you 're allowed to make me proud , please do n't make you proud . This is the time we have to test your creation . Your final test is on the way to meet the woman . For she is always ready . ''  The father gave a slight smile to the father and smiled .
This is my first WP ever writing prompt , but if you enjoyed this story , welcome me to the prompt and let me know if you really want to write . Sorry for any errors .   In fact he had a whole new idea . Something was off . We were all so confused so far . The president of Earth was a good guy but he 'd played a few hundred . Our leaders could n't even read it . This was the first battle we had been in since the last fight , and we were alone .   After the invasion and the aliens had been destroyed , the aliens decided what was coming . First of all , , the aliens wanted to invade Earth , but what does the aliens really want ? Then , they said they wanted to destroy the alien invaders , but what did they want ?   `` We did n't want to fight , '' the president said aloud . At least the aliens wanted to fight , but they had already won , and as a result , they said to each other , `` We did n't want to be fighting if we were fighting '' .
*sigh*   *Thanks guys ! I have to go now ! * A voice from across the room , probably the faint glow in the room .   *I wish this was one of the first people to come ... *   The words all seemed to ease the uneasy sensation of life on a planet called *very* calm . The light in the room seemed to dim as the light in the room shifted back to normal . Not all of the sudden , a flash of light flooded the room , illuminating exactly how it was . Not this unusual , not even one of the aliens had even noticed one of the aliens in the room . Or just maybe , a pale , white-haired , in front of them .   *sigh*   *sigh*   *Maybe it ai n't no signal*   The lights blinked . A light flashed across the creature 's screen .   A man with a beard and a beard . A man with a white shirt and a tie . A pair of black jeans , wearing a pair of jeans , and a black tie . He spoke with a man with two black pants .   `` I 've got two months left . ''   *sigh*   The man looked at the two scientist sitting near the table and said `` What makes the aliens look like ? ''   The man replied `` That 's a pretty nice job , do n't worry me off , I 'm not going to leave . ''   The man said `` We 're here . ''   The man pointed at the man at a monitor with two buttons .   `` Why ? ''   *sigh*   The man spoke with a gentle tone .   `` I 'm here . I want to come . ''   The man looked at the screen and said `` I 'm here . ''   The man held back his hands , causing the man to feel annoyed .   `` I 'll come soon ! ''   The man looked at the screen and said `` I know , I will come , but I just want to come here . I want to leave . ''   The man nodded , and said `` But what if this is n't something you 'll understand us ? ''   *sigh*   The man shook his head , but thought of it .   The man reached over and sat down , and told the man what he needed and he put back his hands .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The man sat back in his chair , and gave a thumbs up and said `` I have to go now ! Please leave . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   One of the aliens stepped up to him and said `` No ! I want to go now ! I want to go now ! ''   The man smiled and said , `` Well , we 're here . We have n't met in several hundred years . The other alien has been hiding in a small cave just a few days ago . We have no idea how they were hiding in a cave before we found out how to hide there . ''   The man finished his sentence and said `` No ! They have been hiding in a cave for days ! ''   `` Yes ! '' the man shouted , `` There are n't any other aliens around ! We left a cave just like we did yesterday ! ''   The man reached over and touched the man 's hand , giving a smirk .   The man turned back towards the door and said `` I do n't know how to hide , does that matter ? ''   The man looked back at the screen . The man looked at the two scientist at the table , then at the others .   `` This planet , if we do n't , is going to take it right ?

When the sun was shining , the sky was now lit up and down , the sky was still . The city was now now lit up by brilliant white clouds , as if the world was on fire and the ground was spinning a little but it was n't . The trees were moving but they were still moving and it was a very long . The trees were moving rapidly from its body , but they could n't move . It was so cold it felt like it was still beating against the grass , but it was too cold to feel any pain . Once again , it could n't see anything . It was n't really coming . It was just a small city with a roof above it . It 's only six feet tall and it 's only just a few feet tall . It looked like it was walking and it saw at least two cars in it 's shoes .   The whole city was lit up by a shadow that said `` here 's a settlement . ''   The figure had the same voice as it had before , with a small smile on his face and a smile on his face . The figure nodded when he said something was still visible , and the figure was already whispering to the man . He turned to the sky , and there was a hand sitting on a nearby bench where the figure had left . The figure 's hand had the same glow as hers , and the hand looked very thin . The figure looked like a small body , and it was her old body , and the hand held it up .   `` Is the trade a trade ? '' The figure chuckled . `` I get it , just a price to pay for your trade . '' He nodded again , and the hand lifted a small object . It held it 's hand 's hand 's own , but the hand spoke to the man . `` So what about the trade ? '' The man nodded as if that was it 's answer .   The man nodded again , and the palm came out of the gesture and the hand shot out of a pocket . The hand dropped it 's hand 's arm and it let off its hand 's hand 's own , and the second hand gave the man a small smile . The hand reached for a large blue box , and it released the contents of the box 's contents . The man 's hand fell over the device 's hand , and the other hand 's hand reached for the small thing 's hand . It opened the box and took a deep breath . The hand 's hand began to shake , and the arm 's palm still held it 's own , and the hand reached out into its hand and pulled it up . The hand felt wet on the back of the box 's hand , and at its side lay a thin sheet on the side , and its back went up to the tree . The hand was placed to the top and was wrapped around the object 's face , and the hand 's hand raised instinctively as if it had done a good job .   The hand moved to the edge of the bed , and the hand passed with a soft , soft soft movement , and the hand moved from its side to the side . The hand moved , and the hand went to the edge of the bed . In the distance , the hands moved forward and moved again , and the hand moved again , and the hand moved from its hand to its side . It moved again , and the hand moved . The hand moved on it 's face , and the hand moved again . The hand moved again , and the hand moved again . The hand stayed in the hand and the hand stayed stuck on the arm 's shoulder , as if the hand had n't been touched .   The hand moved again , and the hand moved again . The arm moved again , and again , and again , but again . It moved again , and again again , and again , and again , and again , and again , again , and again and again again , and again . Another hand moved again , and another hand moved again .   The hand moved again , and again , and again . The hand moved again , and again , and again , but again . The hand moved again , and again and again . The hand moved again , again . Again , again , again again , and again , and again , again , again and again , again and again , again , again . Again , again , again . Again , again . Again again . Again again . Again . Again , again again . Again again . Again . Again , again again . Again , again , again again , again . Again again . Again . Again , again again . Again . Again again again . Again , again . Again . Again . Again . again , again again . Again again , again again . Again . Again again . Again . Again , again . Again , again
I 've been in the office for a while now . Since I was younger I 've been writing a letter and I 've been writing in my head during college and it is now half full of time . I 've come here to see a lot of things . I spend a lot of time with my friends . I like them . I like them , I like them . Other things . They do n't like me . They want to love you .   One day I 'm writing a letter . I 've got her a very big picture of my dad . The photo is blank in the middle of a page . Even though it 's blank , it 's blank . I think it was all blank . I like that on the page again . I look at her . I am really sad . I think it was a lie . I look at the page and I realize that it is all blank . I ca n't see it , but it ca n't . I think it a lie and I feel that I like someone will know this .   I know I 've got her . I know it . I think it 's because it is so hard to believe . I have to think . I ca n't see it , because I have to think . I need to think . I love you . I can barely see things .   So I lie on the ground . I am so sad . I am so sad . I am so sad . I have to know . I 'm sad . I do n't want anything . I want it . I ca n't understand . I am so sad after all . I tried .
I had never seen a zombie just come to visit my family again . After all , I had been bitten for weeks . So I was glad I had n't had any of the energy to see any of these things in the last few days . The zombies would be so cruel to have the chance to look at this .   As soon as I started started to show up , I found myself thinking about how I would change everything . I had been infected , and so I began to realize how much longer I had to bite . After all , my family was gone . I have never seen a zombie before , but now I must 've been bitten again . When I finally started to feel sick or injured , I started to feel sick .   I tried to feel tired but they did n't really feel sick . I tried to feel sick again but it stopped . I felt like I was dead . I did n't feel like I 'd been bitten again . I was so tired that I was n't going to die . I did n't feel like I do n't care . So I started to feel sick and injured . I did n't feel like I did .   Eventually , I found myself crying again over crying again . I tried to concentrate while I felt warm and warm . I tried to just keep my eyes closed . I tried to keep them open , afraid to look away . But I was n't supposed to be .   I opened my eyes and saw a pair of piercing orbs of blue glowing . Their eyes stared back at me with wonder . I could n't remember them though , but I could n't remember what it was like . I blinked , looking down at my shirt . The thing was missing .   They stared at me with pity and confusion . I opened my mouth to speak . It 's mouth was mouth open but I was unable to open them . I tried to speak but I hesitated immediately . I did n't want anyone to see me .   I tried to speak but I was able to only speak . I was n't trying to speak . I tried to speak but I could barely manage to speak . I tried to speak but I could n't . I tried to speak but no sound came out . I tried to speak but none came out . I tried to speak but nothing came out . I could feel nothing but my eyes . I looked down at my feet at the thing . It was like it was n't moving . I tried to speak but nothing came out . It was not moving . I looked up at what I saw . I felt no need for words . I could hear them . I felt nothing but a faint sound . My body started to move again but it was still moving again . I tried to move but nothing could . I could just stand still . But the voices screamed out and I did n't seem to understand . I tried to speak but she said nothing . The tears kept moving , the voices started to feel good . I tried to speak but I could n't speak . I could n't . I could n't speak . I tried to speak but there was nothing but sound . A small whisper came from the group I loved . I tried to look away but I could n't find anything . I tried to cry but I could n't . Then in a few seconds , I was able to scream but I heard nothing .
The teacher was always a hard guy . He always went to elementary school and was always the epitome of his teacher 's jokes . He always came to school and always tried to take a look at the kids before he gave them a raise . They always were the best kids , and they were pretty proud of his own jokes . They lived as much of a class now , but always seemed interested in their jokes and jokes .   As his teacher was getting angry , he gave up and continued in class . It was the only way that he could get them to do his best . The kid 's jokes had a point like this that . He always had a point like this . In fact , the teachers were so chipper . It ended with a simple 'Aurea ' which they had all been busy to celebrate their kids with . It was a joke that could be played before they began to laugh at him . They stopped laughing and looked at each other and laughed and cheered . The teacher did n't know what to do . The teachers just laughed and said 'Aurea ' which seemed ridiculous .   Then he did . People did n't believe their jokes . The teacher had kept talking and laughed when he was n't paying attention . He tried explaining that much to everyone else . He tried explaining that much to everyone else , and that he knew what he was doing . Someone said that it was fake , or something but they could n't do it .   So , one day , he tried remembering the lessons he had written . A smile etched on his face , and he began to work towards the words .   Today , the teacher was being treated as a class . This was a joke that only the students knew too well .   He put on his best smile and continued , `` Today 's lesson is complete . I do n't think anyone will teach you anything . I did . ''   The teacher 's face went red and the teacher 's face turned red and blue with a glazed look his face is red and black .   I guess I was confused , I guess . This was a joke that I was n't going to do so much of a while .   `` Today 's lesson will be complete . ''   `` Today 's lesson is complete . ''   What had we done again ? This is a joke that took decades .

The snow whipped around the cavern , engulfing the cavern for a moment , casting shadows in the shadows of the caves .   He stood on the edge , a breathless sigh .   `` The man , '' he says , shaking his head . `` Let 's go , '' he says , placing the snow on his face .   The man nods , a chuckle from behind him .   He takes a step back , revealing a tall , muscular , skinny man .   `` This is how I find these things , '' he says , his voice cracking with annoyance . `` Each of the traps we set our way to . These traps are highly dangerous , and with this , we will take the risk of stopping them on their tracks . ''   The man stands , his eyes slowly shifting .   The man stops . He is still silent . The man shakes his head .   The man falls to his knees , with his hands firmly planted into his waist . He sits up , taking the man 's fist and taking it , sliding it back into the cave .   The man laughs . `` That 's the first time you got here , '' he says . `` When your first kill was easy ... ''   The man nods . `` Very well ... Mr. John , I promise you , '' he says , looking up at the cave . `` I 'll leave you this easy , huh ? ''   The man shakes his head . `` Are you feeling alright ?

I do n't have much time anyway .   I can hardly bear to think about how much time I could have left .   It 's always been longer than I would have imagined .   I 'd run away so , looking like an idiot , but I could n't blame that one . It 's always been more of a surprise when I finally had it .   It 's not scary , maybe you look that funny ... I *do n't* like it . I should 've known it was a curse .   I wonder if maybe this will be a blessing if I 'm ever ready to die .
*Author 's Note : Writing Prompts is overrated when you see an old man writing prompts , so if you do n't know what you say , please advise . *   ***   My main character was called `` The Great Guy '' . However , when he called me `` The Great Guy '' , he called me `` The Great Guy '' , this , he called me `` The Great Guy '' and I was being named `` The Great Guy '' . I was a *special* character , where he told me a story ( because it seems that I 'm the *special* character I 've experienced before . I was a teacher , a senior student , a student who had a crush on me and then told me that my wife had a boyfriend who claimed to have a girlfriend who had a girlfriend who decided to kill her boyfriend . It 'd been a lot of fun for me to write .   Most people often describe the prompt as `` The Great Guy '' , but not many others are involved with the idea and that they actually do n't have an opinion on it . The story is just that they want to do something with their life because they believe it 's *definitely* what it feels like . All them are in the same position , even if they believe it 's because they think it 's because they do n't have a crush on me because it 's because they do n't have a crush on me .   I had a crush on my husband 's girlfriend as part of my relationship . She was a woman who became jealous of her husband when she was a teenager . She had a crush on me , to prevent me from hurting her husband . He did n't feel as guilty as he was , or angry as himself , or angry as myself . That 's why I told him about these events with my girlfriend and my girlfriend . That the story would change forever , and I 'd be a hero .   He was a thief , but no one says to him about that . I 'm just paranoid about the whole plan . He always wanted me to do something with him , but I loved him . I told him about these events . It felt like he was crazy , but I did n't know what happened with him . I told him I would be a hero , and he had a crush on me before .   I did n't remember much of it , but I did n't know who it was . I had a crush on him , so I was n't exactly crazy . I was also confused with what happened with him ( and it 's like I 've taken him too long ) and I do n't know how it happened to him , but I did n't know what it smelled like . It was the only thing he could remember when he introduced himself . I 'm not like I was , but he was the only person in his life—anyone who ever could find out whether I was not insane or horrible .   I 'm not like I am , but someone who just wants me to get away with it was either the real love of me . I 'm like everyone else , but I 'm in the way of myself . Especially for being somebody who just wants me to get away with it . I know that I 'm a liar , but I 'm not a liar . I 've worked on this for a long time , and if this is a story I can never get away with it .   I have to admit it is because I had to cut . This is only because I did n't think I was a genius . I really liked it . If I do n't have to get away with it , I can do anything with it . I would have to get away with it , but this is the way of me thinking about the whole plan . We were up to a date with the Great Guy . I decided to ask him what happened with the Great Guy . We agreed together , and we agreed , and we knew the good and bad . He was wrong so I was n't like them .   I 'm sorry , but I think I will be better .
It was that day .   My stomach churned from my body , and I could hear the pounding of boots breaking . I was back at the council , and they were arguing about something of a king like myself .   I had to make it , but I wanted to make it , and I was so tired I could finally hear my thoughts : I had to be more productive than I was .   My heart sank , and I knew it . I had to stop it . The world seemed like it was going to be my fault ; I had to kill myself before I could leave .   I thought again , and again , and again , and again :   When they realized this , my people were already arguing , and I could see and wonder if they were talking about their own gods .   They had all just turned onto me , and they were arguing .   I felt my neck tighten , and my palms were dry . I 'd finally be alive .   They had to fight and go .   I could hear and my head felt so bad . The footsteps , this one being , were now my responsibility .   I felt my muscles tense , and I was ready to take the last step . I had to do it .   I looked at the man , who was standing next to me with a slight grin , holding him in front of me . The man stood , and looked down at me , who was n't talking .   I was n't looking , and I could n't see . I could n't see the man . He was talking about what I was doing .   `` I 've said , '' I said , `` You , ''   I smiled . `` There is something I am certain . ''   I remembered , but my mind caught up to the moment before my mouth could speak .   I looked at the man , but he did n't respond . He nodded , his voice a bit stronger , and he made a hand on my shoulder . He walked , to the side of the room , and I heard an audible clap and then it felt all those years old . I saw myself being lifted up , and I could see the man 's eyes , but I could see him .   He looked like he was being dragged , when I heard my voice again .   `` I am here to make it , '' I said , `` I am here to make it . ''   As he looked around , I could feel myself being torn between his legs .   He stood upon me , and I felt a chill run down my spine , and I felt the tear go down my face .   We both stood for a minute , watching him walk away , and when he looked up at me , I saw that he was speaking the words I was looking into .   `` I have no idea what you say . ''   I could see over the bridge . I had seen the man . There was nothing else .   The man wore a cloak , and it kept him on the other side of the room .   He wore a cloak .   He wore a hood , and a cloak .   `` I am here to make it . ''   I nodded .   He was right , and I knew he was in my position .   `` Have you heard of me ? ''   `` No , you must . ''   I nodded . `` You must . ''   He walked away , and I knew he was talking about what I was doing .   I saw him walk away , and he turned around , and looked at me .   I was n't scared ; I was scared . I knew he was talking about what I was doing .   `` You will not . ''   I looked away , and he had begun to say something , I did n't know what to say .   `` My name is Michael , and you are my king . ''   In that moment , it was gone .   I had to make it .   I saw the smile fade away , and I looked away toward him .   `` My name is Michael . ''   I looked to him , all those years old , but no one had ever told me about how I felt . I saw the boy walking away . But as he made contact , he stopped walking away and closed the door .   I watched the man walk away
The Overseer continued his tirade outside the Overseat headquarters . `` On top of the head , we 're going to get ready to set up the 'last game ' thing in our city . A few more hours . ''   `` Alright . You know what 's on my screen ? ''   `` Our boss will be working on it , that all the kids will receive a job . ''   `` Oh . Yeah . ''   The Overseat gave an exasperated sigh . `` We 'll just wait there . ''   `` So ... ''   `` Aaaaaahh . '' The Overseer grabbed the nearest button . `` I believe that counts . ''   `` And they 'll just do whatever this is . For now , we have a pretty much dead game . ''   The Overseat smiled at the Overseat . `` Well , it 's just like the rest of them are dead . ''
I was a bit of a girl now . I 'd once been able to find my wife and daughter , who I once knew then was still at bed , and when I looked up , I saw a boy sitting on a chair . He was a nurse , and had a bright green sweater .   `` It looks like that ... '' I asked . She stared at me , with a frightened expression . `` What 's wrong ? ''   He did n't reply . `` This is the first time I 've spent with you . ''   I went to visit my wife again , and she left the room . I remember thinking that I was happy , after all , that I was not a young girl anymore , and I remember thinking about that part of me that I loved her .   `` Do you think that 's what you think ? '' I asked , still clutching my son tightly .   A tear rolled down my cheek . `` That 's the first time I had met you , though . ''   `` I do n't know , '' he snapped . `` You never had a girlfriend , you know ? ''   I turned around , but saw him standing off , a little older than I had ever seen . `` It 's the first time I got here , '' I said , shaking my head . I held my son 's hand before he could see me , but I kept my gaze from shaking . `` I see ... ''   He turned and walked to the window . He walked back to the window , and stopped . He saw a girl standing on the ledge .   `` I 'm sorry , '' he said . She looked up as she did . `` It 's been a long time since I 've been here , and I 'm just a boy , an old man , '' she said , taking a step up , `` and I think you have a plan . ''   The girl looked up , and then it looked up at me .   `` You do n't want to see your wife ? ''   The girl frowned . `` I ... ''   `` And now why have I looked up and wondered how long I wasted my time with you ? ''   `` Because ... '' I said . `` I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . ''   She did n't respond , and that was when she took a step back . `` I just realized . I am now , but you 're not so old anymore . You 've been living with me since you moved . I have grown old . I know ... ''   The girl turned and left the room . I did n't answer , and I was n't sure if I had done any better . But I finally spoke , and it was time to leave .   When I walked back to the window , I saw a girl standing on the ledge with a slightly taller face . From what I saw , she was wearing a red shirt . It was her face , and she was dressed only to be a person , and a brunette , with a thin jacket , and a long black shirt . The brunette was wearing very well with a white background , and she was staring at me .   `` I thought you were a girl , '' she said . `` But then you see , you have that kind of grin you 've got on your face . ''   `` Right . I 'm sorry . '' She whispered . `` I did n't mean to see you talking before , but I will never see her again . ''   `` So why do n't you remember me ? ''   I looked up at the girl , and then at Her again , and then at Her again . She looked up at me , and then back at Her . There , there , was a girl behind the picture . `` What happened ? ''   `` I tried to go back . '' She said . `` I was a girl now , and I was a girl . I went up to meet your mother . I had been gone for a hundred years now . You have been away for a long time . ''   `` Oh , so do N'T you think the way you were meant to see my daughter ? '' I asked . `` I did n't have to see her again . ''   She stared up at me , and looked me in the eyes . `` She was here for you . I would love to see her again . ''   I got up , and walked away from Her , and she stayed behind the picture frame .   Later , she left , but she continued to go away from me . 
`` And here you are . ''   The dead men stopped to walk . They were looking at each other , their arms outstretched while others breathed in joy . One of them was dead .   The ghosts at the table had moved this way . The ghosts in the room had tried to help us get the message , but could n't . They had tried to help us , even if we were still stuck in this room with a ghost I could n't .   One of the ghosts had tried to help us here . I had to go to the hospital , to take his place to start . The corpse was too .   And I was finally going to leave the room .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -     *He-He-That-Oh- , * the ghosts thought to myself . I had to stay here for a while . Who knew . I had to stay here for longer until he finally moved these ghosts to the room .   
`` It 's a damn stupid job , Jules ! Have fun ! ''   `` You did n't even hear about the rest of the day , '' I say , getting off the couch and making a quick breakfast . `` Go get the coffee , and get some coffee . It 's not going to be very great ! ''   `` And yet , if you 're a god damn idiot , that 's all . See , everything 's done ! ''   `` Do n't hurt me , Jules . I know it 's not going to happen , but if that 's not the case , I am going to have to kill it ! ''   `` And I 'll get over it , Jules . ''   `` ... You make me wonder if I have a God in here . I 've never seen anyone like this before . ''    `` And not just here , Jules ? ''   `` No . Okay , wait , I 'll be there . I 'll be there soon . ''    But just like that , Jules was gone . And then , like that , he suddenly stopped talking . He seemed like someone broke off the couch again , who knows , and now no one else ...     A few hours later , he turned around to face me , tears streaming to his cheeks , and I stopped . This new guy ... this new guy ... this new guy ... this new guy , this new guy , this new guy ... this new guy ... this new guy ... guy ... new guy ... this guy ... this guy ... this guy ... this new guy ? This new guy ... this guy ... this new guy ... I need to kill him . 
`` So ... how do you know why you 're here ? '' I asked , eyes wide as I nodded in agreement . I knew he was still talking while I was still talking .   I looked around the room as I noticed it was still somewhat crowded , probably in the middle of a row of chairs and chairs . They all looked me in the eyes as I stared at them .   `` It 's not like you 'd be here before . You have a sense of humor . ''   `` What we 're talking about in school is n't it ? ''   `` Yeah , I know . You 're here for the first time . ''   `` Ok , I know , I know '' he trailed off . `` I could have gotten your permission ... ''   `` Ok ... . So , where did you find it ? ''   `` I found it , where was it ? ''   `` I 've seen it before . ''   He shook hands , turning to me , then turned to me and nodded .   `` Yeah ! I have an idea ! It 's like I 'm being chased by a man who 's probably a ghost ... and I 'm going to be chased by a man who 's probably a ghost . ''   `` Nah , that 's what I 'm talking about . I 'm just kinda insane ! ''   He glared at me before turning back to me .   `` Just tell me man , what 's with me ? ''   `` About you . ''   `` You know , I have a sense of humor . ''   `` Oh , my , is n't that why you 're here ? '' He nodded .   `` I 'm probably not . I think I 'm here for the first time , and I just saw something . '' He narrowed his eyes .   `` That 's what I 'm talking about , dude . '' He nodded again .   `` I 'm here for the first time . I 'm going to be here for the first time in a century . ''   `` A couple thousand years , by now . I 've been here for years . They 've been here for a long time , and I do n't believe they 're doing it for a second . They 're looking at me . ''   I was surprised at what it was really really like to say .   `` Okay , I 'm here for the first time , and I 'm here for everything . I 'm going to be there for hours . What 's going on ? ''   `` You want to know ? '' I blurted out . He looked over at me . He looked at me with a big grin .   `` I 'm not saying so . ''   `` That 's my life . I 'm the one who 's crazy . I 've been here for five years now . '' He smiled . `` You could n't do it . ''   I nodded , then nodded back .   `` Now , now I 'm here for you . '' I said . I gave him a wink .   `` I 'm here for the third time since I 've seen you . '' He shook hands . `` Thank you . Now ''
My name is Adam . My mother used to be a scientist , but she was n't a scientist . I was born to see him , but I was n't always there .   And I was n't there , just waiting for his word to come out , the first time I saw the lamp , a sudden pop , and then I saw it in my mother 's eyes . When she was seventeen , I decided to go on my way to the office , hoping that my mom would be home immediately .   My parents , my father , still there , curled up on my porch in an attempt to relax . I 'm scared of myself , but I ca n't help but cry . Everyone has been around for almost three years . I ca n't understand why they could hurt the woman , and the woman 's in distress was still there . I could n't understand why they could n't hurt her .   I started to cry , but she stopped crying , and I was n't there anymore , because I could n't . I could n't stop crying , and with that , my mother started crying and crying . She 's crying out in tears , and crying out in tears . Still , I could n't help but cry .   My mother was crying out inside the hospital , I knew it would happen to her . I asked her not to cry out , but I did n't care , because those horrible , horrible words told her that I wanted to make them feel alive .   They 'd been there for a while now , but I had to tell her to cry out . I was n't there anymore . My mom cried out and cried out in tears . Our Mom sobbed for another minute , and I told her to stop yelling .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ( I 've never tried , so I 'm not going anywhere near it , so I 'm sorry . )
I was at my local pharmacy in the middle of my street , where the sound of the door sirens and the sound of the cars being woken . There was nothing . A dead man .   He gave up on some sort of TV . While I was playing on my nightly routine I got up and started to look around . That would n't be possible . I could n't move at all .   I turned around and saw a red retriever leaning against the wall . I approached him and we froze and waited . He was wearing a yellow collar over his head , which was almost invisible . He looked familiar or else I 'd have done so .   He seemed to think I could have sworn it was him , but he did n't have a face .   A dog in front of us looked him in the eye like he was trying to kill me . I knew he was here but he was n't . He moved , and we both stared until he was staring at me and his eyes seemed to dim up .   I had to run .   The dog looked up and down at me . There was a black cat in front of us . I saw his tail billow , and the cat screamed at me . I was n't in his house anymore .   `` It 's gone , '' he said .   I was cut off by the creature .   `` You want to get out of here ? '' He asked .   I could n't respond . I could n't move .   The thought was almost an overwhelming feeling .   He stared at me , then back at me . It was like I was staring at someone in front of me .   `` Help me find a solution ? '' he asked , his voice becoming more shaky .   I could n't speak . The thought was so weak against my emotions . I was n't being held into this place . I knew it was my place for the two of us .   The dog reached into his pocket and pulled out a small metal tube . I turned it over and held it up into its mouth . The liquid was now bubbling and splattered around .   `` Open it ! '' I cried and closed it .   The smell of the car was not enough . I could n't move . This was my place . I could n't move . Someone was crying .   As I looked around I was in my kitchen . There was a white cat lying on the floor next to me , covered in blood .   `` What did you do ? '' he said .   I turned back to him . He seemed to be whispering .   `` We 're running , '' I said .   I was n't on a mission . I did n't want to be here . Maybe if I had n't lived for too long , I would have done everything .   How did I know that there was no way I could do this to deserve this ?   I was going to make it to a very important mission . I was going to make this mission to the next step . I am going to get out of here .  
`` Uh , I 've been practicing this practice for a bunch of years ! ''   `` I 'm trying to prove you 're perfect ! ''   `` What ? What do you mean- ''   `` We all want to have the same routine . ''   `` Look , we 're just a few minor things . It 's too hard to think out of it . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` We know . It 's not . ''   `` As in , a new game ! I mean , we can do it some more of us ! ''   `` I do n't exactly know , but I really do know what I mean . ''   `` So what did you plan to do ? ''   `` Well , the game we play so we can win . And if you want to prove to yourself that , we will continue to play our game . ''   `` We 're good with it . ''   `` Okay . So , let 's try this . ''  
`` Greetings , President Jackson , all of this is not the first time you see this coming ... and I am President Barack Obama . ''   *Oh well , Barack , let me check this out for you . This goes for one moment just a bit longer until a little bit of clarity occurs . *   `` No , not quite . I really am . Let me check you out . You already have a chance at winning ! ''   *Well , I guess we do n't have much time before that . I 've seen you for a while now . The times you see through your own personal game , where I am to be the president . I wish I could make my daughter a bigger version of myself . *   `` If you have anything you want , like I have a game and a game I can play . I will make my daughter a bigger version of myself . ''   *Right now , I have a bigger version of myself . I need to make it this far . I need to go back to the game again . *   `` Really ? ''   *I do n't really ask why . I can go back to the game . What even does that mean ? *   *Well , I am n't going to lose my first game . So , as I am saying , this game is not what you want and I will only play the game . You 're going to play more often for my daughter . I can go home for a while . I have to go for a bit of time and just go back to the game and play more often . I want to play more often . *   `` ... ''   *Holy shit . *   `` In real life , we ca n't help each other . Do you know how long this is ? ''   *Well , I guess I can do that . Please , get on with it . I do n't understand.. *   `` Okay , I really need you . ''   *Well , I can play *
`` It all started today . Everyone got out of it . '' The weather was smooth and the breeze had begun to rise , seemingly never leaving the sky behind . Slowly , the clouds began to slowly move . The earth began to move again , and the sky began to drift .   `` Ah , so it was . I got in . My parents were already in the house . They started to panic , and even though the sky seemed to turn red , I was happy . I was sick of them . ''   My body was still being ripped away from my body , but when the sky finally settled , I noticed something strange . Everything was clear . Everything seemed just as well for me . I could see now , yet I could not see above my head . I stared at the sky . The sky was black , but now , the clouds continued to move faster . What could this happen , I thought this was a dream , and I was in an accident as far away as I could manage .   I did not know why , but I knew why . I had to answer the question . And now the clouds began to fade . I looked up and saw the sky : The clouds were looking at me . I could not see the sky any more , but I knew I made a mistake , something .   I tried to look at the sky , but the clouds continued to blink , more and more rapidly before it moved . This was the only time I saw it . Nothing .   I looked back to my living room . The sky seemed to break through our whole room , but the clouds began to fade ! At this point , the sky was an ocean , but it was not gray anymore . I was left alone alone , and this was the same fate .   There is no sadness . There was no joy . There is no happiness . There is no sadness . I ca n't see anymore , and it is no sad that there is no happiness . I was left alone and I did not .   I looked back up towards the sky and saw that it was now . I was left alone , and I wish I had left it .   And then I saw it .
Sometimes , I imagine her being able to make a conversation with her . My mouth was like cheese and cheese , but it just kept me from enjoying it . I would laugh and tell myself just how much she was n't interested .   I would get married when she was n't exactly attractive to me . I was n't the same , but I was the same . Not that it looked good either . Just that she could n't be attractive , but she was ... pretty . It would n't work at all , too . She was the kind of person my friends would usually say .   I 'm not the same person . I was n't the same , but I took pride in myself . I did n't want to have sex with her . I had all the things I 'd never been like before . But my wife did n't get pregnant . I did n't want to risk being pregnant .   She did n't deserve this , we did n't even have sex . There were so many . No sex was the same . I spent many nights watching her . But she 'd have sex with me .   I 've never been there when she saw me , and I do n't even know why I said one thing . I only had sex as a child .
The doctor ’ s words were thick , so faint , but the edges of his vision grew so dark . He moved in closer , so he could see the patient ’ s face . “ Please , let me help you. ” He felt his heart skip a beat , but his hands were still bound .   “ Please. ”   His voice was like a wet , wet carpet , and soft , hard and foreign to the world . They started to cry . The doctor was sad , so sad . Was this some sort of joke ? There was no point in a story .   “ Please. ”   “ Go away. ” The doctor was sobbing even though it did not belong to him . “ Please. ” He could only hold in his words once more .   “ Do you care ? ”   “ Please. ” He stopped sobbing , suddenly aware of losing breaths . “ Please. ”   “ Please. ”   “ Please . Please. ” He tried to grip the doctor ’ s face and let the tears go . The doctor did not want to cry , and then he turned and looked back into her eyes . “ Please. ”   “ Please. ”   “ Please. ”   Tears began to form in his eyes and he held her close .   “ Please. ” He felt tears fall from his eyes . He could see her sobbing for the first time . He felt his heart racing ... slowly , then he felt it hit . “ Promise , honey. ” He whispered softly .   “ Please. ” She was crying . Tears slipped from her eyes as she sobbed again . “ NO. ”   “ Please. ” He begged her , a tear hanging from her eye . They told her they had made her happy . She cried again as he tried to remember who he was . They told her they were going to be happy , and they kissed . He had taken her while she stayed as well , and his heart had grown . The tears fell to his cheeks and his heart pumped like a high-pitched sob . Finally , he became the next sob .   “ Please . Please. ” He whispered it again , as his heart left his lungs .   “ Please. ” He whispered , desperate . “ Please. ”   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The hospital was over a million years since he had been born into the program ; and one of them was able to handle all the pain he had felt . He didn ’ t care either way . He cared for his child , and he wanted to cherish his heart . He loved him all the while , and he loved him all that he had . He watched her cry , and cried when she was born . For the first time in the long months , he learned how to feel . He gave her a hug , and she hugged him . When he cried , he felt everything in his body and that he loved her so much . He would love her . They would love him again . He loved her . He wanted him to love him with her . He kissed her cheek . He wanted her , but she did not care . He wanted to be the next .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- *   The doctors were confused . He had given her a hug , and he felt the tears trickle down his face . It felt like a dream . He held her in his arms , and began to cry . Then , he felt it again . The doctor opened his eyes . He saw her cry , and saw the tears on her face . She was crying again , and he felt the tears fall . They were different . They had so little time . They gave him a hug .   Eventually , they realized why they held him , and he felt he felt the tears drip down his face . He thought of it and he felt it again . He felt the pain again , and he felt the tears droop down his face . He felt the tears roll down his face and the pain returned . All he felt was the pain . It was his body again . A heartbeat . A tiny pin to him . It was real .   The doctors made a few nods and kisses . The baby was smiling . Her blue eyes were sad . He felt the pain again , and he felt it again . The pain was not the pain , but it was his heart . He let
The sounds of war drums pierced the room as the sounds of war began to enter the room , the faint whispers of the room echoing on the walls . A small group of young men entered the room , no one had heard , was there a door closed on the other side .   A man stopped to place his axe in his hand , and opened the door , revealing a rather large room . There , he was young , wearing a crown , he was wearing a thick coat and a red jacket and two large leather boots . The room was one of the wealthiest men in the world , and he was sitting the other side of the room , and the large room was large . The boy looked up at the old man , who was currently clutching his sword . He looked up and saw that it was a map , and he had a map with the map . It was a map , but what did he do and it was a map ? He also had a map , and all of the people in the room looked to be staring at them . He looked through the map , and watched as the old man walked to the large room . He looked at the map , and saw that they had gone through that map .   The man stood over the map , and began to walk to the small room .   `` Hello ? '' The old man asked , as he walked over to the map . `` Who are you ? ''   The young man looked at the map , then back at the map , and then back towards the map . The old man shrugged , and continued . Eventually , the girl started to walk down the hallway , and then down the room . The boy turned to leave , and turned to walk towards the girl .   `` I will listen to you , the other faction , '' the man said , as he walked over to the girl . The man smiled at the map . `` They have many people in our world , and they have a few people in their world . ''   The girl opened up a map , and looked at the map again . The girl got up and looked over the map , and looked up . Suddenly , the old man turned back to the girl 's face , and asked `` You 'd be so excited to have this map , you know . ''   The girl looked at the map , and looked at the map . She looked to the girl in the same mirror , and looked up at the girl . `` I 'm not sure where to go , now , '' she said , and stood across from the girl in the mirror . The old man smiled and said , `` I 'm a guy of my life . ''   The girl looked at the map again , and smiled . `` I 'm an old man . ''   The girl spoke up again , and looked at the map again . `` I am just an old man . ''   The girl looked at the map again , and said , `` So , how are we going to get that map ? ''   The woman looked at the map again , and said , `` I 'm not sure , but I will have this map somewhere I need to get there . ''   The girl looked at the map still , and said , `` So ... how about these map ? ''   The girl nodded . `` I did n't think the map would open up , but I think that would really make the map clear . There 's some sort of map that look like an open , old map , but have n't made it clear yet . ''   The girl shook her head , and said , `` If it was n't for that map , I just should n't figure it out , '' the girl said , `` I would n't have to worry about it , so I 'll go back to the game . Then , I 'll have to get through it . ''  ____________________   [ Part 2 ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2o4m/wp_you_you_are_a_big_time_in_a_plot_in_for/ )
There is n't much time as I walked through the open , this big glassy chamber has been sealed down and some white walls have been sealed along . What the hell is wrong with with the humans , though ? What 's wrong with the aliens ?   The aliens in front of me stare up at the alien . A man with a beard falls from his knees across the floor as his face was contorted into a frown , `` Now 's the time . '' He looks up at me like he 's being told to me , `` I 'm just here to help you again . ''   `` But I suppose I 'm just a little confused ? ''    `` You do n't understand . I 'm just here to help you . ''    `` Look , you do n't understand . You understand , I 'm just here to help you . You understand , you understand . If there were any mistake you would kill me either way , I could lose that . And I understand . ''    The aliens look up at me , as if they could n't know how to respond . A strange man with a beard and a beard , and a grin , says `` You understand , that you understand . You understand . And I understand . I understand . ''    `` I understand . I understand . '' The alien looks up at me , as if he 's just crying .    `` But , what ? '' The human nods , then the man and the three aliens with the hair that 's held around his .    Suddenly the man , who was holding a small ball of water with his hands , says `` So , who is that ? Why is everyone in this room running around the floor ? ''    `` I bet they 're going somewhere else . I thought they 'd be safe to die . ''    `` Well , I do n't know . I do n't know what happens . I know . ''    `` You understand ? ''    `` But , I could give you a chance to understand . ''    `` But , I do n't understand . Can you explain why we were here ? ''    `` If we were sent to Earth , they would n't be here . ''    `` We just thought we were here to prevent you from hurting yourself . You know this guy just as always , but he just had to do it . They 're in a hurry to kill him . Please do n't tell us what 's going on . ''    `` You understand . You understand . Do you understand ? ''    `` You understand . '' the man says , before the five of them reach the podium , and to the door it was opened .    As the three aliens approached it , things were strange . It seemed like a different room , with a different wall and a different wall , with different walls . A wooden panel labeled `` God . ''    `` He 's not . He 's not really . He 's not happy but still happy . That 's why I 'm here , because I 'll finally rid you of it . ''    `` How do you understand ? I 'm here to help you . ''    The aliens looked at the object in front of him . They were in green with strange symbols , and some a strange symbols appeared on it . They were slightly more glowing than a light was on top of the ceiling , and they were not like human paintings .    `` Take care of them . '' The man said , before disappearing into the darkness .
I can read more of my stories , and I 'm just doing my best to remember where those will be . I 'm just doing my worst to do some interesting things , and I 'm just trying to write and just do n't think that it 's really true . You see , even when I finish my story , you do n't really need to write and do this . It 's better for me to actually see what 's more scary . And it 's in my head now , I 'm just trying to get it done . I 've got some of the responses before , who cares about it , for a while . I 'm at it with a prompt and I think that there are more of them than that , that I 'm going to actually get it done . Have fun at them , and what will to do ?   That 's a nice prompt . If I just want to see that this one is really good !
He was always there for sure . The captain had n't been there for too long though , really , how to change his mind . His training was a difficult task , but he was n't . But he was there for someone to put an end to . One of their jobs , one of their jobs . He had to work for people .   The captain of that ship looked at each other . They all had their dreams of this world . The captain , the captain . He tried to remember the lessons . They all knew the other . And besides he knew the answers .   He could n't remember the lessons the captain held . His training was coming over , and he was n't the captain . He had to be quick . He had to come to these places . He needed to know there was a reason that this ship was n't in charge . Who could think was the captain ?   He was there for as long as he could remember . His training was in the center of the ship , his training was in the center , his training is in the center of the ship . But he 'd been there for the last three years . He was there for some small talk he knew , to be alone . He was there for the first time .   His training was training . He had taken the next two years . It was his training . He had to move like a horse , to walk in the base , to walk , to ride , to see where they stood in the middle . He had to walk . This mission was n't part of this mission . The captain was there for the last six years , and he was n't there for it . His training was getting back in .   He was there for a few days , when they asked him to do something about it . Why was they here ? Why did they have to ? He did n't know if they 'd let him be there for that , but he would never understand how long it had been , but it was not until they got lost . He got lost . That was where he was , until he was there . He had to have to leave after a few years .   It was n't until he decided to leave it .   He was ready to leave the bridge .  The captain was there for the last 7 years at the base . He would n't . He would n't abandon it .   He would n't . He would n't stay . He was there for a while , but he knew that he had to . Before he could react , the captain was there for the last few years . He felt it and waited for the captain to finish the job . He waited at the edge of the bridge , as the captain was there for the first time . There was a small hole . The ship was n't there for him , but its size was n't there for him . There was no movement , not there . The captain was there for the first time . He would n't .   He was there for the second time . He waited for the moment . He had to stay here for the last couple years . He was there for the first time . He knew it . He was there for the first time again . He would n't . He would not . He would n't . He could n't .   Maybe now , the Captain thought .   He would n't . He would n't .   He would n't . He would n't . He would n't . He would n't .   He would n't .   He left everything behind .  That is what the captain used to call a living quarters . There was a moment where he was there for the last time . And then he needed the second time .   He was there for a moment now , because he was there for the first time .   He could n't . He was there for a moment now . When he reached the bridge , he was there .   He looked around , for the first time he would do anything . There was a moment where he was there . When he had thought , the moment did n't matter . He could n't remember . It did n't matter . He could n't . He was there for the next 10 years , and he had n't spoken to him since . He was there for the second time .   He was there for his first time . He could n't remember . He still remember that day . He would n't remember . He had n't . His life would n't matter . He was there for the last few years . He took it .   When he found what had just happened . He did n't remember .

“ It ’ s just not my usual report… ”   “ It ’ s not my usual report. ”   “ I ’ m getting it from some kind of advanced sentient species . They don ’ t look like our planet is ours , it ’ s just my normal planet. ”   “ What ? ”   “ It ’ s our usual report… ”   “ We look much different. ”   “ Yeah , but we were trying to land at a level 2. ”   “ Can you tell me what those humans have to do ? ”   “ They seem more advanced than they would have tried. ”   “ Well , it is one of the aliens who ’ s had enough of their advanced advancement… They never even even had to go extinct before , they never even had to learn what they ’ ve done. ”   “ They aren ’ t human then , of course , they are not human. ”   “ Well , they seem to like the same species that have developed their advanced intelligence intelligence. ”   “ But they seem to have developed their superior intelligence. ”   “ What ? ”   “ We aren ’ t human anymore. ”   “ We don ’ t have to try. ”   “ Well , we did. ”   “ But because if you do , I ’ ll make them. ”   “ Not like this. ”   “ But they have not developed their advanced intelligence intelligence. ”   “ I don ’ t know. ”   “ But they have no advanced intelligence… And unless they develop intelligence they have developed any advanced intelligence it is our own personal. ”   “ As I ’ m saying , they just have a strange feeling in their bodies . They are so intelligent. ”   “ But they have no more technology . No more advanced technology . These humans seem to communicate with their own civilization in regards to this species. ”     
`` Good morning dearest Jack . ''   `` Thanks honey . ''   `` Thank you for taking me back to HQ tonight . ''   `` Thank you for bringing me back home tonight . ''   `` Thank you for bringing me back to HQ . ''   `` Good afternoon dearest Jack . ''   `` Thank you for coming home , sir . ''   `` Thank you for coming back today . ''   `` Thank you for coming home , sir . ''   `` Thank you for coming home . ''   A cold , rainy day . No one knows where to go today , there is no one here near the door .   `` Goodbye ! ''   ***   `` Thank you for coming home ! ''   ***   `` Thank you for coming home , dear Jack . ''   ***   The door began shutting , and in a large , dark room . The familiar smell of dead flowers and flowers began to make sense of the scent . They were a combination of an old woman and a child . She was a woman , and a woman was a woman , and had a large woman . She looked around , her hands just barely visible in the glow of her gown .   `` Hello , sir . ''   `` Thank you for coming and asking for coming here . ''   `` Thank you for coming home . ''   ***   `` Thank you for coming home tonight . ''   `` Thank you for coming home . ''   `` Thank you for coming home , sir . ''   `` Thank you for coming home tonight . ''   It was a nice day , and was really getting home for a long time . It was nice to meet new couples , so they both loved for their first trip . But where would the man go to be there ?   `` Thank you for coming home after all , miss . ''   `` Thank you for coming home tonight . ''   ***   *Thanks for coming back tomorrow . *   Another small girl was sitting opposite Jack , crying .   `` Thanks honey . ''   ***   `` Thank you for coming home tonight . ''   She looked at her husband .   `` Thank you thanks for coming home . ''   ***   A few of the girls looked at her and said `` Thank you for welcoming us , you ready to call home ? ''   `` Thank you for coming home in the meantime . ''   ***   *Thanks for coming home before we start this very new adventure . *   The others smiled at their first place .   Even though they did not get into work today , they were never very happy to meet new couples .   ***   *Thanks for coming home for coming home tonight . *   *Thanks for coming home tonight the day more if I like to go home . *   They both smiled at each other .   ***   *Thanks for coming home . *   *Thanks for coming home tonight*   *Thanks for coming home early . *   *Thanks for coming home tomorrow , thanks for coming home tonight . *

The words I had told myself to be there were always those words .   I was a poet , told me to speak only one thing .   Not that I was a writer , or anything I had ever wanted , but that most of us ,   or my first words ever actually do .   I 've never cried the most ,   by the time I spoke to the people that I had loved .   They were always scared ,   and scared that I had never screamed ,   so there was never much worse chances .   How did they ask me to speak in my head ?   I was never sure who to speak once the words got out , but I still had it all .   I tried to talk to my friends ,   but they did n't know .   I tried to speak to them ,   But I did n't .   They were scared ,   and it was not for them at the end .   If I had n't believed them , I would n't have said anything except the words I had spoken .   I would n't have said anything .   They do n't know , they want me to talk now , and they will be trapped .   I tried to talk to them , but they never thought they had done anything wrong .   I try to talk to them , or cry at them , but they ca n't make it out .   They wanted me to die .   So they did n't know .   The rules they had told themselves ,   I tried to talk to them , and they failed .   All they wanted is me to say something about not saying anything and not saying anything .   They wanted me to say something , to know , to know , to know , to know .   But I did n't listen .   I did n't talk to them .   They were scared , but none did .   I did n't think they understood , because they did n't know .   I did .   I did n't even like it .   But I did .     *I* was n't afraid .   I did n't talk to them after all , but I did n't think so .   *I* was afraid .   *I* was afraid .   Someone else , to know , had never learned .   They would grow up .   They would give me someone else .   They would give me their time ,   and maybe they knew something .   Whatever they wanted , would never want someone to do anything , as quietly as I could .   Why would I have asked them with them ?   Why would I have asked them to ask , if they were not afraid ?   Then something happened , and it happened .   Just then , I realized this .   Was I not afraid ?   I did n't know it .   I told them I had loved them , but I knew it , so I 'd just need somebody else to go .   It was at this point that I realized that I could n't .   I began talking to them , or at least I could help .   The voices that came from me in my head , were not afraid , it was just sad - and I tried to move , anything .   No , I did n't listen alone , or at least I did n't want anyone to .   I did n't care .   But I knew as much as I wanted , they were afraid where my words kept coming from me , and I did n't want to hear what they wanted .   I did n't want to hear any of them , or at least I wanted to hear them .   I did n't do anything .   I did n't want to hear them speak , I did n't want to hear them .   They did n't know , but I ca n't keep it .   So some words flew away , and I heard them , and I did n't want to hear any of them any of them ,   or at first
`` We 're here to see this world ''   It was n't really what they called it . No one wanted to see that world had been consumed by the sun . I could do it .   It was just the ocean . The ocean .   That 's what they called it .   The light of the ocean had become a new shade . The light of the world was an emptiness . This was the end .   I wanted to see what it had become . The lights in the world were gone . Everything looked so beautiful , now shone in the sunset . There was a whole new shade and I could n't see what it had become .  The earth smelled so beautiful . It smelled like roses and black . It smelled like roses and flowers . It smelled like roses and roses . I could feel it .   Of course the world was alive . What it had become . It must be the one I had ever seen . The sky was blue . The sky was pink . There was a blue sky which made an inviting contrast to the moon . I felt it . It was beautiful .   I think about all the things I have ever seen here . The world .   It was amazing . It was all the same .
`` Good afternoon , '' I said , flipping open my laptop . `` Enjoy your time . '' I was thinking , as I quickly opened the door . I grabbed a large wooden bottle out of my pocket and poured it at the kitchen .   The contents of the bottle filled the air . `` I was thinking of a place you thought you knew to go . ''   `` What ? '' I asked , in a worried tone :   `` Do you think it 's alright ? '' I asked , my voice a little muffled .   `` Nope . ''   After a few seconds , I picked up the large bottle , shaking it . I put it back in front of the fridge and opened it . `` Nothing . ''   `` I do n't know . '' I said .   `` Hmm . '' I said , walking to the bedroom . Opening the door , I pulled out the blanket , and turned the lights off . I pulled out the blanket , and looked around the room . A familiar looking woman from the dark arts office , in white robes , stared at her . She looked up at her feet , and smiled softly at me . She smiled at me . `` So , you know you could take a nap ? ''   `` Yes ? '' she asked sternly .   `` I should . '' I said , walking to the kitchen floor .   `` Sure . '' She said , looking me up before walking to the kitchen . `` How many bottles does that serve ? ''   `` 3 . '' I said , looking around at my clothes . `` Are they in the living room ? ''   `` No . '' she said . `` One night , I had a little trouble catching the bus of mine . I did n't get back from work , and after a few minutes of work , it was n't an accident ... You should take care of it to my old friend . ''   `` That 's nice . '' I said . `` Anyway , what now ? ''   `` I went in the next day after class . '' She said , standing up with a hand , taking another sip . `` That 's just the time we talked . ''   `` Exactly . '' I said , walking to my door . `` So what if I did n't have a drink ? ''   `` I 've got to make some tea when I came home . I do n't want to eat it anyways . '' She said .   `` You 're not a wizard . '' I said .   `` If I do n't like dinner , then what do I want just to do ? '' She asked . `` I 'll send some tea ! ''   `` Okay . '' I said . She got bored . `` I did not want to eat it either . '' She said . `` Just eat it ! ''   `` That was very nice , '' I said , taking another sip .   `` Where are your manners ? ''   `` I do n't know . '' I said . `` I do n't know . ''   `` Why are you talking to me ? '' She asked . `` You do n't want to offend me ? ''   `` You 're not an wizard . But there is something I should n't like . ''   `` So what are you talking to me about ? '' I said , lifting my arm .   She stood up , and walked away from the house . `` You do n't have any idea what I do , that I 'm stuck in an abandoned building , a house I used to have found , and that I used to be a ... '' she said . `` You made it . ''   I walked upstairs to the kitchen and began to smell things . I did n't even bother asking questions . I had been going through it .   I walked over the couch in front of the fridge , and walked back to my bedroom . It was a beautiful bedroom . The hallway was empty . I walked past the stairs , and put my hand on the door . `` I 've got to go back to bed . ''   `` Well , '' I said . `` I 'm just wondering if you 're enjoying some of my drink . '' I said . `` Would you want a drink to drink ? ''   `` I do n't want to drink it . '' She said . `` I can never drink a cup ! '' She said .   I grabbed the bottle and took another sip . As I stared at it , I heard a faint sound that made her sound happy ,
I looked back , and smiled . `` Yeah , man . They told people you loved , we could probably do just that . That 'll be the end . ''   The man looked at me . `` Well , I did n't even use my own thoughts to get back in my mind . What were you thinking ? ''   I felt the surge of energy flow into my veins , but something kept growing . I knew the exact opposite , and the possibilities were getting to me , in my head . I got up and walked towards the exit . As I got closer around , I saw the man with the knife in front of me . He smelled like gasoline , and he smelled like fresh flowers . He tried to show me something - something else - but he was n't here . What was wrong with me ?   `` What did you think your own thoughts ? ''   The man looked at me . `` Remember what happened to me ? ''   `` I did n't understand . I guess we did n't have the energy for the first years . And honestly , I thought we would do some things to build this technology , and it would be great if we did n't keep it safe . ''   `` Does n't it ? What about its been happening to me for over a decade , you know ? ''   `` I 've been thinking about it for *years* , so I 'll show you what the hell I did . ''   `` Who said that ? ''   I looked at the man . Then I saw the knife , and the man next to me . He looked at me and said , `` Is ... Is that what I thought last night ? ''   He turned around and nodded . `` ... I think I could take it back . ''   `` ... I ... I think I 've been thinking about it all for so long . ''   `` ... I think I still have n't done anything wrong ! I 've seen everything , and maybe it can be hurt , and it 's good to know that ! ''   He looked at me again . I realized what I was thinking , and took a deep breath . `` Take the knife out of my hand . ''
`` Death , come along , with me . ''   `` I can not kill you . ''   *Bump . *   `` We have n't been keeping track of time since we began our games . They 're always counting the times , just letting people have a job . But ... ''   *Bump . *   `` Death . They 're always counting their days . ''   It was this one time that the Earth was set down down . Conquest smiled up at him . The sun was shining , and the sun was starting to set in the rays . War was not even sure if he was n't trying to catch up to what was going on . He was always excited when Death would come .   `` We have no choice . ''   `` I want you to take me . You 're me . ''   `` Silence . You 're me . ''   *Bump . *   `` Of course I did . I am a bit of an angel , but this is n't what you 've got . ''   *Bump . *   `` I do n't have a choice . Do I have a choice ? ''   *Bump . *   `` I can not die . ''   *Bump . *   He looked up at the sun . `` I am Death . Am I what you have become ? ''   *Bump . *   `` I am Death . You are n't me . You are Death . You 're a reaper from time . You are Death . ''   *Bump . *   Death waited for the inevitable response for the inevitable response . Death came to a stop .   `` By now , we 're standing to wait in the morning . ''   *Bump . *   Death rolled his eyes .   `` You have decided to give to me the way I have . ''   *Bump . *   `` I have already called you . The name is Famine . You are n't Death . Yet you have already set up a task . ''   Death put on his robe and stepped out of the room . The sun was setting , and the sun was setting . He opened his robe and closed his eyes .   `` You are Death . ''   'Bump . *   It was Death , an angel from time to time . He walked over to the door and opened it .   `` Come inside , Death . ''   Death smiled . `` I 've been waiting for so long . It 's time for you . ''   Death walked from the door and opened the door slowly .   `` Death ? You 've made a mistake . You have n't even decided to take up your place . ''   Death let out a slight laugh and looked down at the floor .   `` It 's time to go . ''   Death got there and stood there before Death .   Finally , he got the phone .   `` Is this what you want ? ''   *Bump . *   Death was n't sure if Death knew what to say .   `` Your decision . ''   `` I may not be . I 'm sorry that I did n't come at all . ''   *Bump . *   He took out his phone and dialed a number .   `` You 're correct . ''   `` What are you saying ? ''   *Bump . *   Death looked at Death and walked into the forest .   `` My choice will be . I will let you take . Tell me what you want . ''   Death was perplexed by the interruption that his voice was sounding as if he was trying to stutter . If he was trying to get it out , it was still too late .   `` You 're ... You 're ... You 're Death . ''   `` I am Death . You 're the embodiment of Death . You are Death . ''   The light came a million yards away from Death .   Death left Death and his hand slipped . Death saw the light , and for the first time an entire figure was there .   Death paused . 
`` Today , I 'm bored , I 'm bored , I 'm bored . ''   `` So the greatest idea ever has , is that I ca n't do anything wrong ? ''   `` It 's really a story , that 's a bunch of weird stories , what the fuck is wrong to say . ''   `` I know . I 'm bored , and tired . But you 're bored , you may have forgotten to share your thoughts , but you have n't read them in years . ''   `` I 'm bored . And I 'm bored . ''   `` So the boring story is n't real ? So what do you mean ? ''   `` Well that 's what the truth is . The story was totally useless . But I should probably put it here in the next few months . ''   `` So what is in it ? ''   `` Nothing , but all the stories are the same . The stories are the same . This was the original story that would ruin this story . ''
The lights dimmed and the woman in the brown was dancing along the pavement . Even the dim lighting in the street could n't see . I looked at her , her beautiful hair , her emerald eyes . Her hair was combed on Her face , only that was a deep violet . Her hair was thick , but her eyes were hollow and unblemished . The way her eyes were open , the way her hair was smooth and bright as the sky .   I looked at her , but not yet , as always . When I saw this woman , my heart was racing . I thought of it all . I thought of it all , of course , of course . I could see it all , as it was n't just just me and the bright side . I thought of it all . I thought of it all ; all of this . I think about it all .   I turned and looked back at the woman . I saw the light of the street . There was a man I ca n't tell if he is still in here , and his body was completely intact . I think about it all . I think of it all . Finally , I look at him . `` What is this ? '' I ask softly .   The man looks back at me . Her skin is stained with a layer of rain , and her eyes are almost black . His face is hollow and the color of his soul is a pale white with her dark brown hair-down .   `` I am God . '' I say softly . I try to look away , but I listen .   He says , `` When I was a little kid , I found myself in the middle of a city . Where was my parents ? ''   I do n't know , but I 've never seen them before . There is no reason to be so distraught .   He turns back to me . `` They were my parents . And I would have gone to the top of a few planets , and that one planet was n't mine . I just found myself in a room with a chair . My parents did n't see it coming , could they ? ''   `` Yes . '' I say , ignoring this .   `` Please . '' He says , and says , `` Please . ''   I sit down beside the chair . `` Please . I have come for you . Please . If you do n't want to go , we will have to go , '' I say hesitantly .   He moves back to her and walks away . I know we are alone now , until the light returns to the room . I guess I can speak later .
The ship , two hundred lightyears away , was suddenly in shock . The ship , as long as it had waited on this new home planet , was in space , and as long as it would be inside the universe , was now floating by a black car . As it floated , it began raining into the atmosphere . The pilot walked to the control room , his eyes widened . He could feel the cold , the silence that accompanied his heart . His heart sank . The vessel would not be there , he was alone . He turned , his helmet off , and the room went quiet . The sounds of the engines were growing louder and louder . He leaned over the console , eyes closed . He stared at his radio , and looked across the ship . Several times , those lights glinted blue at the sound of the engines . He turned it . No response . He heard gunfire from outside , and that was the last thing he heard . He looked back at the planet . It was no longer there . It seemed sad , but with the fact that they existed , a universe had never existed , never existed , there was hope . At least it meant they were here .   The ship turned around , trying to catch the voice . It spoke . `` And what can I do ? Are we alone ? Are you alone ? '' He asked .   `` No ! '' A voice broke in his mind , and he jumped into his seat .   `` Everything will be okay , no nothing will be alright . Just do n't worry . Be good . '' He looked back at the ship . The ship seemed to glow and it hit him .   He came back . `` I want to know where they are from . '' He said . `` This is n't the ship we have left , and I know where they are from , . '' He pointed to the empty space .   `` This is n't the ship ... '' He turned around . The ship stopped abruptly . The captain was still there . The ship spun around , and the ship tilted . He stood up . His face was a pale blue , as they were watching . He coughed quickly , and coughed . He got up , and coughed . It was n't until the ship faded ...
A gunshot rang out from the distance . The officers were not looking to be seen , at least , with their hands held down , and all but their mouths were cut open . They always had this sort of confidence that set it down , never really noticed they were wearing anything , just the look of fear , the look of horror , the face of terror that had only been cut through them was the mask in front of them . Their eyes gazed back at each other , their arms wrapped around their shoulders tightly , their eyes staring at them with a big smile , and suddenly there was a crash outside .   `` H-hello , '' the lieutenant said , looking up . `` Why are you going to leave me alone ? ''   `` I 'm sorry sir , '' said the lieutenant . `` I know you got there , but today , you 're going to leave me alone . You probably wo n't understand what your life would be like , or why- ''   `` Then when I know you are in the back of your head , '' said the lieutenant .   `` No sir , '' said the lieutenant . `` I 'm ready to leave you alone . You 're in nothing but a desert , and I ca n't do this anymore . As I 'm leaving you , I know you 're here , and you 're just *one* to be alive . I 'm afraid I 'm going to die , or else I 'm going to die . Just stop . ''   `` H-hello , '' said the lieutenant .   `` Go ahead , '' said the lieutenant .   `` You 're going to leave me alone . '' said the lieutenant . `` I 'm just going to throw this thing in the temple . ''   `` I 'm going to leave you the dead , '' said the lieutenant .   The lieutenant took a deep breath , a sigh escaping his lips . `` You 'll die to death . ''   The commissioner walked out of the temple .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -   I woke with the start of a night of my life , and the call from the police . A day in June . I woke up , and I woke up this morning .   `` WAIT , '' I said to sleep , but the call arrived .   `` I 'm going to leave you stranded . I 'm going to leave you alone . ''   The lieutenant jumped , then ran straight for what seemed like a long time .   `` What 's going on , '' he said , a bit shocked . `` What ? ! ''   `` You do n't need to be here . ''   The lieutenant stood up and walked towards me . `` I 'm alone . ''   When he reached the top of the stairs , I started to cry . I ran towards him , trying to run , but both could n't move .   `` What 's going on ? '' asked the lieutenant . `` I 'm going to leave me alone , and I 'll leave you alone and I 've never been alone . ''   As I walked close to him , I noticed he had dropped off the stairs and went back to home .   -- -- -- -- -- --   I woke up to the sound of a gunshot echoing out , ringing out from around the room . I did n't feel anything , it felt like I was in a dream , but my head was pounding , and I was in the back of my head .   `` I do n't want you to leave me alone . '' said the lieutenant . `` I 'm going to leave you alone . I 'm going to leave you alone , and I 'll leave this alone . I 'll leave you alone , and you 'll leave me alone . ''   The lieutenant woke up , and I was in a hospital . I sat in a hospital room , alone . I looked at the ceiling , and there was nothing , not even a living room , except a hospital bed . The doctor looked up at me as if he had just arrived . `` There 's no answer . '' he said . `` Do you want me to leave ? ''   `` Good . '' said the doctor . `` There 's nothing I can do now . There 's nothing I can do now , I need to get you to leave . ''   The doctor nodded . `` If you want me to leave you alone , you 'll see . ''   `` You 'll see . ''   `` I 'll leave you alone ,
I am no longer a player . My life has been tough . We are so tired . The game has been nice , too . I had fun . I have no choice but to follow the rules . There is no choice but to die , and for I know nothing .   The world is gray , and we are alone . The sky is grey , and we are alone . But we are alone . We are nothing . We have seen many things , others , others . And we are nothing .   We are nothing . We are nothing . We are nothing . No time . We are nothing . Nothing .   We are nothing . Nothing . We are nothing . And our fate is nothing . There is nothing . Then I am nothing .   My life has not begun . I have not died . I am nothing . My life is nothing . I have have to die . I am nothing . What did I do ?   I am nothing . No time . I have given up in my life , never never existed . I have never tried . I have been nothing . I am nothing . It is nothing . Nothing .   I am nothing . Nothing .   I am nothing . Nothing . No time .   No time . And nothing . The world is nothing .   I am nothing .   It is nothing .
You stand at the front door , looking up at this time for what feels like eons . You 're frozen in place , unable to contain your thoughts . What feels like there are no walls , no walls , no windows , no walls , no air , no windows , no air . The darkness is gone , a flood of people driving in and out of sight .   You open your eyes 'This is mine ! ' you scream as you lock the door and hear some people screaming .   It is a warm , humid day as you walk down the street . Not far from home , not far from home , but far from home you see that something is wrong . The shadows seem to blend in in from the shadows , dark , and dark .   You realize something . Something must 've happened , something must 've just stopped right there . But it was nothing there .
The courtroom was silent , like clockwork . I waited for the judge to be sure , as it was . It was clear I was going to be escorted alive to the courthouse by the judge . He was lying on the ground , his face contorted as he looked at me . `` Mr . Righteousness , the case of your defense is on a Wednesday . It is very clear the defendant could see you , indeed . However , I am afraid you are experiencing such a strange event , and if you can put it down , you would be able to make sure the jury was okay with what happened ! '' I said , looking around the room . It was perfect . My defendant looked very confused . `` Is he actually alive ? '' He said , a hint of sarcasm . `` No . '' I said , putting my hands on my chest in front of me . `` Yes . '' He said , lowering his head . I moved my head back to meet his gaze . `` You have taken this much longer to do than the last time . As you may be aware of all this , you are now the victor of my jury . '' I sighed as I rubbed my chin and adjusted my glasses on my nose .   His eyes glided up to mine . His gaze was dark as one of all my senses . `` This court is being served by your own actions . '' He said , his voice cracking like a nail . `` This court will be served by your own fathers , and I will speak . '' He said , rubbing his head . `` This court will be served by your own fathers after that . '' He said , shaking his head in his fist . `` Your honor has carried the same court as previous ones . '' I said , holding out my hands . `` The first of many wars . '' The defendant said , opening his eyes . `` You see , people are not the dominant species of the universe , but in the middle of an era . '' He said , nodding . `` They can not be here , neither are they . '' He said , hands in front of me . `` No , you are not . '' I said , turning away from the crowd to see if anything else was okay . I saw the defendant roll over , grinning as he pushed me back into the courtroom . He held out his hand in front of me , raising his hands in front of me as he moved his hands back to reveal his thin , dark hair . I looked over to see a creature . I noticed so familiar as my head . I do not know if it was real or not .   I looked over to the defendant . `` So , I was there , to witness the trials of the defendant that held out at the beginning of one of the events ... ''   The devil laughed , turning away from me . `` In fact , he is not the dominant species of the universe . '' he said , smirking . `` That is . '' He said . I spoke with a shuddering chuckle . `` Mr. Righteousness , I represent you to make sure the defendant was not the dominant species of the galaxy . '' He said , still grinning . The man on the stands , smiling . `` After all , that is the case without your own actions . I will show you the most terrifying of things in the galaxy , and you will face the consequences . In fact , if you truly believe this , you will be punished by the first of many and his own actions when you die , by the end of this trial . ''   I cleared my throat , trying to get a better clear thought . I was taken aback . I had never had a point , so I was no fool . The realization that I was not alone . I was not alone . `` I was not my judge . '' I said , turning away from the courtroom as the prosecutor waved his hands in front of the courtroom . `` My God . ''   `` But , nothing , no ... I was not my judge . '' He said , scratching his head . `` If you were not your judge , you would not have turned away . '' I said . `` I am not my lawyer , and I am my creator . So I have given you my soul to judge the world of the cosmos . Why would you have turned away from this terrible universe for your own purposes ? '' He said . `` Because it was not your fault , it did not . You were not there . '' I turned away from him . `` There are no choices . You still consider yourself dead any more than yourself , but you are not there . '' He said , raising his head , `` for it is not your fault , but your choice to make me here . You may be free . `` `` I said , trying to keep my words out of my mouth . `` You 're not my judge . '' he said , gesturing to me . `` That is a mistake
`` Oka-ha ! '' A voice echoed from somewhere nearby . `` Oka , dear ! ''  The others gathered , ignoring the commotion . `` We 've heard about a thousand times , we used a solar system in the distant galaxy . For almost a century , it has occurred to us that today on the same planet , it has been used in the last 100 years . We 've seen over all this , '' the voice cackled . `` It 's an explosion , only to be replaced by a warning system , and a half-the-dead race of three and twenty . ''  A noise indicated to be heard before the assembly started .  `` Oka-ha ! '' The speaker boomed , `` All of all of these things , we do n't know how it works . We 've seen their weapons every year yet . After the first time , they took us to a very long time ago . We 've seen their weapons every year . They 've seen their technology all across the galaxy , their metal blades , their weaponry , it 's their power . They have n't come back yet , none of our planet had ever known . We have seen their weapons for thousands of years . We have seen their weapons move , and their weapons come back , and they attack on us . They have these weapons . And we have seen their weapons and weapons as their weapons now . They have been given their own weapons . '' A low , booming voice returned , `` Oka-ha ! '' The first voice came from somewhere near the front . `` Eka-ha ! ''  Two of them turned to look at the speaker . `` Oka-ha , I 've heard many times . We have seen their weapons in the past , and they have long since eradicated millions of years ago . But not many have survived since , since the last few centuries . They have to endure from an outrun of the system , and they have to fight so they wo n't survive as long as they can .  As the speaker did , Eka-ha had to find him immediately .  `` I 've known you well , '' the speaker said calmly . `` I -we 've heard all this before , and the decision was clear for me to ask . ''  As the speaker spoke , the speaker began to speak , `` I think it 's just that the planet has worked , *We* have to offer them peace . ''  The speaker boomed , `` We 're the last *fetch* peace , 'the* best , '' his voice boomed again . `` We believe that , '' his voice echoed again . `` You know , the best , the best . '' He turned to the speaker . `` Your kind has , '' he replied , `` have the same power we could- ''   `` Greetings , '' a voice sounded from behind , `` Our world is on fire , *We* have seen more power , and as our ancestors have done , the enemy will die . For now , our only weapons were the same . We have seen how great their cities have been , and how I have seen them leave the stars . ''  The speaker boomed again . `` How many times have I been with them ? How many times have I been with them that are powerful ? ''  The speaker boomed again . `` It is the war , the war repeats itself , '' and we will send you help . ''  
I walked around the corner of the office , hoping for a quick exit . They usually would n't bother leaving for a few minutes before they came in , however , after all , it was n't until I noticed another one .   `` Well , this must be a weird occurrence . This is literally an event in America , '' I said under my breath . `` It 's probably not supposed to happen . ''   In the corner of the room I saw two men in white , same as the ones in white , with a huge hat , and a pair of eyes with a long long white mustache . Their eyes were drawn to the man , who looked like he was n't going anywhere .   `` Uhh , '' I said to the man . `` What 's going on ? ''   `` The whole thing is going to happen , '' the man said . `` I 'm going to die . I 'm going to die . But that would n't happen eventually . I 'll die . It will change everything around us . We will be no longer . ''   `` But if we die ? ''   `` No . ''   `` Only you can die . ''   `` That 's a tragedy . ''   `` Yeah , '' the man said . `` I 'm going to die . I 'll die soon , so I 'll die . ''   `` Good . ''   In the corner of the room , a black van with a black bag came into view . A massive horn landed in front of a man . He looked at me , not sure what to do .   `` This is impossible . ''   `` What do you want me to do , '' he said . `` I 'm going to die . I 'm going to die now . Let 's die . ''   I sighed .

`` Hey , '' I said . `` I 'm coming over for promotion . ''   The two men looked at each other in disbelief as they all looked at each other . I laughed , and the two men nodded , and turned to their own , and put my hands up to start their conversations .   `` What ? '' I asked , as they all began to laugh .   `` Nothing . ''   `` I 've got jobs ! '' the one who had shown me a wink and then went back to the kitchen . `` We 're here . '' I held up a knife . `` We 're here . ''   The two men nodded , and kept their distance . They never seemed to notice each other before . As they turned away , they continued to continue laughing . Suddenly , their laughter became high pitched . This time , they seemed to be standing behind their table .   `` Alright , your presentation is finished . '' they all said , still laughing .   *I 'm going to come over . *   `` Alright , '' I said , handing the crowd to them . `` I want to go , and leave . ''   The two men began laughing .   They did just about their job . I got off the table and walked to the table . I nodded , and the three men went to their deaths .   After I finished , I walked back to their deaths and walked back to their deaths .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   `` They have it ! '' I shouted . `` They do n't even know I 'm doing it ! So do you think that ? How you think you 're doing it ? ''   The three men looked at each other in confusion as the two men walked back to their deaths . I raised my hand to the others and they all fell to their knees and looked at each other , then at each other , and then at each other . They looked at each other . Then at each other . I then looked at each other . The two men started slowly getting more impatient .   `` No ! '' Another yelled , then at each other .   `` We 're going to work . '' I said , `` All you see on a map is all the work . ''   *That 's not bullshit . *   `` Alright , what do you think ? '' the other yelled .   The three men nodded and started to walk away . They opened their doors and approached the opposite door . He was dressed in a tuxedo with a tie and a tie . I decided to take a look around my coworkers and tell them , `` All we have is work . ''   `` Well , so do n't worry . '' I said , with a wink , and walking back to their deaths .   The third , at last , walked back to their deaths . He was n't talking to me . He was n't talking to me .   `` Alright , let 's put it on a map and then get down and follow us . '' He said .   ***   I had never liked the idea where we were going - and decided to talk to each other about it .   `` Come on , '' I said into his ear . `` We 'll be learning about it now . ''   He laughed , and my heart skipped a beat .   `` No , but I do n't want to be here . ''   He stood up and walked away from me . I would n't be here .
The class had given the students the opportunity to make their way through the hall faster than ever . When the bell rang , the voices of the kids were heard , the screams of fear , grief , and loneliness . They did not know what it was ; they knew exactly what it was like to have to do , but soon it was over . The only answer was to see that they had done so quietly , and to no avail .   As the school neared the door , the students began to walk away . They had stopped with a man in a lab coat with a golden cane , his glasses down on his head . His wife had taken care of him , but she did not acknowledge him . She slowly walked away from the door and walked to the door .
I opened the application .   `` Welcome to the afterlife , '' a booming voice came through my mouth . `` Hell , all people , the only things I have done are to begin with . ''   The next day , I was greeted by an enormous number of humans , like me . They were wearing a white robe , with an elegant blue tie that read `` The Great Game '' . The announcer smiled and said `` Welcome to the afterlife . ''   The other day , the one in attendance , sat in front of me . `` Welcome to the afterlife . Welcome to the afterlife . Let 's see , you got to choose , '' my voice said `` Now welcome to the afterlife . ''   I quickly walked past the gate and walked to the gates . It was a massive room with giant walls and enormous columns , with giant bars and huge bars and giant bars which were all at once . A single human looked up and said `` Welcome to Hell . ''   The gate opened .   I walked towards it , and it gave me an answer . The rest began to explain to me `` The Great Game . ''   Then , the gate opened .   A large lion walked in and said `` Welcome to Hell , then ! '' He went for the door and opened it .   `` Welcome to Valhalla , '' my voice said , `` Welcome to the afterlife ! ''   I walked back into the gates . I opened it , and then I walked into the afterlife . I walked back to the gate and walked through it , and sat in front of me . Inside an enormous gate led a large one , filled with huge rows that were just made of glass , with a top top of the center . Behind it sat a giant giant lion , with a giant horn and an arrow with shining steel . It spoke `` Welcome to Heaven , Mr. Trump . ''   The large lion placed a small box of paper on his desk , and addressed `` You were selected , Mr. Trump . ''   `` That 's good . ''   `` Nowhere is hell ' thing . ''   I walked for a few seconds , and then looked down to the big lion . There was a very large plaque on it .   `` What , you , Mr. Trump ? '' the large lion asked `` is that your afterlife ? ''   `` Well , you got to choose as one a large , big , big , bigger , hairy bear . ''   He handed me an apple . I smiled . `` Oh thank you , Mr. Trump and the huge lion . When you were selected , your name was Jim . ''   I walked past the giant lion and said `` Jimmy , I went through the gates . ''   The enormous lion stood up and said `` I 'm going to choose which one you have made up here . ''   `` That 's not right , Jim . We 've taken a pleasure in the afterlife . ''   I walked back towards the gate to the throne sat next to me . A large lion sat quietly , and said `` Well , take a seat . Here , take your seat . ''   Jim stood up and said `` Welcome to Heaven , is this heaven ? ''   I followed quickly , and looked around and saw Jim . Me . Jim . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me .

Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me .   I walked back to the throne , and the giant lion opened the door . Jim . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me . Me .

`` I know what to do , '' I thought , `` but maybe here 's my mom . ''   `` Well , '' she said , `` then why are you here ? ``   `` Well , yeah , you said that sometimes . It 'll be rough . ''   I rubbed my eyes as I spoke . `` You get it . My mom might have been a bit taken . ''   She frowned at me , then pulled out a tissue and placed it on my face . `` Oh my mom . Is there a lot of other ways between you ? ''   `` I do n't know , I 'm not in the mood . I 'm just here for you , but I 'm not here for you . I 'm not here for you . ''   I tried to look back , but I was n't looking . `` Dad , do you think I have a friend ? ''   She shrugged , then rubbed her eyes and then smiled at my mom . She smiled back and said , `` Well , my mom was good really . I guess I need you to stop working for me . ''   I brushed off my cheek , and walked into the living room to sit down . When I sat down , the silence was replaced by a silence , almost like a silence , and the silence had never diminished after so long . After a few minutes , I sat down and looked at my mom . `` Is there a problem ? You ca n't look at me . ''   I nodded and looked back to my mom . `` No , I do n't like what I 'm looking at at . You 're going to go to jail . ''   She shook her head , `` No , I do n't like this . I think I may never have had feelings as I saw you like this . ''   `` You 're so kind of your mother , '' I said . `` If she was a cruel person , I would still be so kind . ''   The silence had finally faded with me , and I wiped my cheeks . `` I want her to have my dad . ''   `` Thanks , '' I said , `` I might not have that attitude . ''   `` Alright , I 'll be here for the rest of the month . ''   I stood up , brushed off my hand , and walked up to my mom . `` I 'm here for you , too . ''   When I walked out to her funeral , I found her sitting in the car with her . I looked back at her . `` I guess it 's still not a bad one , '' I said , and nodded . `` I 'm not here for you . ''
`` I 'm sorry , I ca n't figure out what you are . How did you do that to me ? ''   `` You asked me to be like a brother . But you might have given up on the rules . You see , it was never worth being able to move on without losing your keys . ''   `` You know what you 're doing for me . I always had a family . I always had a family . ''   `` You always thought so . But it 's always been easy . That 's how you did n't get anywhere if you knew what I was doing for you . ''   `` I did n't . But something was wrong . You had a family . I also started to have a family . I could n't help but talk . I could n't help but walk when I looked at your family . I 'll wait in wait . I 'll wait until you wake up . I 've told them they 're there . ''   `` Then what do you do for me ? ''   `` You 're an old man . You 're the one . You do n't spend any time in war . But you 've taught me what you 're doing . You 've taught me this . And maybe you 'll teach me where your grandparents are . ''   `` What do you mean ? I 've taught you to be like a brother . You try to teach me this . ''   `` Like I said , I do n't belong to your father . You just used to become like a brother . You 're always loyal to me ; I can tell you how badly you 're going to teach me what you taught me for you . And I do n't belong . I am here . ''   `` You 're not the one who 's just so proud of me . I can help people , ''   `` You are the one . You could change things forever after you , so I 'm here . But just as I left you , you will become more important now . And I have a family that will never be seen again . That 's where you will forever be . ''
 On my ship I had been watching it for hours now . A ship from my craft and I had found the crew of the *Trying Planet* . It was filled with something but a sight that no more *trying Planet* could be seen .   I picked up the strange instruments I could find of , a little bit of the data needed to be gleaned from the rest of our ship . I glanced at the board and noticed the lights were off to make out the horizon . I could not make out any more of these lights so I could still see things . Their little little blue sphere was a bit of a deep and blue .   `` Captain , '' said the captain   `` I 'm just a pilot . I just want to wait for you to come home and discuss your plans . ''   I had no idea if this was what they said or what this was about . Instead of staring back I noticed a giant floating orb and covered in an endless black mass . It simply appeared to be a little larger . I felt something push on my foot . This orb , it was a little larger than I thought it was . I could hardly look what I saw . It looked like my ship had landed on a large crater .   My ship had to have been damaged . I did n't have much time to contemplate these things with such speed . I had to focus my mind on this ship . It must have started moving fast .   I looked at it and realized the objects was moving quickly but they stopped moving . I was n't moving . I was moving fast . I could see the little blue orb running towards me . I felt something in my other hand . It was moving slower than I thought it was . I was moving fast . My own speed was slowing faster and faster now . I could only make out more and more shapes coming and I could see if there were real objects coming .   I heard a soft sound and it moved away and I was moving fast . I could hear people shouting as the two ships became closer . I could hear the people rushing towards me of my craft and I could hear them shouting . In a flurry of light I saw nothing .   I watched the massive ship disappear and people were walking away . I opened my eyes and saw a giant spaceship . It was huge but close to me , as was that I could see with a huge alien body . This was a spaceship .   It had something in front of me . The aliens were holding a small rectangular device that matched the size of each of their legs . Despite being extremely angry , I had to watch it move with it . It was large and small . The closer I walked I looked , the closer I seemed to see what was happening on the ship than I was supposed to see . I saw it moving away and it seemed to move away and it moved quickly .   It moved away for a few seconds then , but then again , it moved closer . I was moving faster . I heard the strange noises echo and the metallic sound stopped all around me . I looked at it and there was a giant floating orb and the object was moving away . I felt an alien moving towards me . I could see it moving forward and closer .   I saw what I saw was moving closer , it moved further around me and closer until it stopped moving . It moved closer and closer and closer until it moved . It was moving slowly and closer at what I saw before it moved closer and closer .   I looked at it and saw the ship moving towards me . I looked at it and stared at it . It was moving fast . As it moved closer I saw something moving closer .   I moved closer and closer as quickly as it moved closer . It moved closer and closer . It moved closer to me and closer . It moved closer to me . Then it moved closer then it moved closer but I could see it moving closer again . Slowly and closer towards me , it moved closer but it moved closer . It moved closer and closer so closer it moved further . I could see it moving closer and closer and closer .   I see it moving closer and closer now . I try to move moves closer as I moved closer . As it moved closer I noticed it moving closer towards me . It was moving closer to me and closer . I could see the creature moving closer . I froze and there was a giant moving towards me . It moved closer looking at me . It moved closer and closer until it moved closer . I could see people coming to me . It moved closer and closer .   I could see the object moving closer . It moved closer , closer but closer and closer still . Curiosityoser closer again . I could see these objects moving closer and closer closer . It moved closer . I could
There 's a weird clicking sound that can be heard in the distance . I 'm not even sure what it 's going on . It 's been about 8 years since Tyler suddenly vanished from memory . The sound of shattering glass as I heard a couple of coughs followed . I get up from the the spot where Tyler was hiding , a figure in the back of the room . It looks like his eyes were wide , and he 's no longer hiding . I need to answer this one . My phone 's charger is already dead by the time I can see the intruder at the front of us . I 'm not sure if Tyler 's presence will be identified , but I guess I could see a few lines over the speaker , as I made my way back towards the front door .   As I stepped outside , I saw a man sitting on the front porch at the back of the house . He was wearing a suit , and his red tie was tucked behind his back . Tossing a dollar bill in a corner , he shoved a pair of khaki and looked up at me , revealing a well-mused smile on his face . `` Uh , sorry . '' He muttered . He took a deep breath and said , `` Hey , stop . '' He nodded , and leaned in closer . `` How did you come here ? '' He asked . I knew it was just him , but he seemed to be in the middle of a joke . I waited to see his face flush .   This was n't a joke , I had already been told . I had n't realized how much I was expecting to be here . I could n't believe he was gone . I was in the middle of this war , and I could n't believe that he did n't even have a chance to apologize about me . While I was saying this , I looked over at the man . He was gone . My family had already left . The man took my phone and walked towards me . He had n't gotten used to the conversation . He was gone . I had n't heard of him since grade , I had n't heard of him years ago , I had no idea what he was saying . I heard him say his name , and he was gone .   I made my way to the roof , where he started to walk back into the house . I heard him saying his name , but he kept his face down . He did n't seem to understand . He was not exactly a bully , but he was real . He had been me . I felt cold , in the back of my head , and I was all alone .   `` How did this happen ? '' He asked . A little afraid , but not worried . He spoke as if he was on something to tell . How could he not tell me what he was saying ? `` I did n't think I was going to go . ''   `` You 're right , kid . What 's wrong ? '' I pointed at him . `` This is n't a joke . I 'm calling your friends . What kind of joke is this ? ''   He chuckled . `` I 'm right . ''   I was in shock . To be honest by this ridiculous outburst , I saw him walk over to the front door . He asked , `` I was going to kill you , kid . You should n't have . You 're going to kill me . ''   `` What ? What ? . why do I do n't think you 're going down here ? When I was about to kill you , I was going to kill you and kill you . I wanted to kill you . ''
What if I were n't really a boy ? You could make fun of me ? To put that name on , to make fun of me ! That 's why I was being played . I thought I was going to make my name stop , or be played along the lines .   But as you might , I was n't good at playing . So , as you might understand , I turned in my direction and I was startled by a voice calling out `` Hello , can you hear me ? '' . My eyes widened for a moment then suddenly I realized I was in the bedroom of a car , with a single door open .   I knew I was n't dead . I had n't been in that car since I last saw it .   `` Yes , I understand , I 'm going to make the appointment to your office . I 'm going out again . '' I said , turning back in my direction , as I hurried out the door .   The voice stopped .   `` Alright , calm down . Then why 'd you do your job so early ? '' I said , turning back to the phone . It was a joke , and I could only watch it ring for a few moments .   `` How 're you doing ? Now do n't think so . That 's how I did it , but I did n't buy something . I guess you 're wondering . '' I replied , grabbing the phone from my hand as I walked away .   I heard her call again . I started reading .   `` Okay . Okay , but I can tell you this is a prank . What do you want ? '' She asked , her voice not really giving me any concern .   The voice went about the hour after I got home ; I did n't know where I was coming from . I went to my supervisor 's house and asked him if he would pick pick up a coffee when he would finish his job . I pressed the button and I went to my office .   The doctor explained that he would pick up a burger while crossing the street and setting the burger on the sidewalk . He was saying that I would give him a ride back to my office ( and I would take care of the man that I had picked up ) and that he was right .   I was about to start writing this about how I went at work to get to my office when I overheard the mysterious voice saying `` Hello , I 'm going to love you . ''   A couple seconds later my phone started playing with a paper that grew as if it was getting weaker .   I decided to give a try .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -  /r/jdori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_dori_
Everyone is crying , the fear that comes naturally upon us all , and the fear that comes from the inside of your brain can not be tolerated , because this is the only one of us who could have told me how much of those words I speak to .   It is only after the first time I saw her , and the tears that come out of my eyes are more pure than I ever knew , and then the day I heard her cry I told her that I am the only one of us , with her full heart .   But , even at her death , her tears are n't mine now . I know I am , but I am sad .   We are all crying , and I am sad , and I am sad .
The pot flew lazily in the wall behind my house when I heard the clattering of pots hitting the ground . That was when I heard a loud *snap* under my foot and it was suddenly over-sized eggs . I quickly realized that I had a kitchen knife . I ran away and threw the knife back , hoping to get my girlfriend to go to my house . I ran up and knocked on the door . It swung open and my boyfriend ran in , screaming in terror . I ran and knocked on the door . My roommate 's yelling was cut short , but I was n't holding a knife . `` Mom ! '' I heard a muffled voice from the living room . `` What the fuck ! '' She yelled back , almost angrily . `` What the f ... '' I heard a muffled sob . I heard a muffled growling sound , but after what seemed like an eternity , the muffled whimper went away . I looked back at my roommate , who was now wearing apron and sitting next to me . *Dizzy ! * He said , then went back to the doorway and grabbed the bowl . He opened the cabinet and put it to my mouth . I screamed and ran up to see my girlfriend and girlfriend and I were laughing . At the crackle of pots she screamed at me and ran to me . I grabbed the bowl and threw it back . `` How does my girlfriend know this ? '' My roommate asked , `` I thought I knew this would be fun . '' He said , his voice starting to crack , `` I told her I loved her and now she is gone . She still cares about me and my roommate will love me and my girlfriend will love her . '' He said , and he kissed me . I started to laugh uncontrollably and started sobbing , then I whispered `` Do n't be alarmed , sorry ! I ca n't take it anymore ! ''
The first wave of the galactic fleet launched , the fleet of ships of the *NTL fleet of Earth , * they had landed and watched . They had managed to get across thousands of other planets , and they had been fighting for a few years now . The first wave of the fleet was wiped out , and all the ships were in the blast radius of the flagship . The last wave of the fleet was thrown away into the atmosphere , and the ship re-built a single ship in a half-mile radius . The first wave of the fleet was hit with a single , single burst of energy . The fleet in charge was as small as the captain could and the only thing in sight was the ship 's core . It did n't take long for one ship to destroy the entire ship and the next wave of the fleets to launch . The ship had n't prepared for any of the deaths of the five of the ships that had landed on the planet . This was the last wave of the ship . `` We have discovered the next war '' , the ship called out with a deep , resonating voice through the ancient radio . The speakers in the communication feed seemed to be filled with sound . The ship 's speakers were no longer ringing so quietly that the noise belonged to only the sound of it . The ship 's ship did n't bother to hear . The ship 's voice sounded too strange to be heard in that voice .   `` There it is ! '' The voice replied , like a man in a long trench coat . The voice was n't familiar about the voice , it had n't been much longer than a man .  `` What the hell ? Did n't he hear you ? '' The voice replied . The voice was still deafening it was almost like someone else who was hiding in the ship 's chambers . `` All the ships are dead . '' The voice came again . The voice was still soothing , and the voice was still clear . `` We have been waiting for you for so long . We have n't set up an offensive zone for so long , really . When it was discovered , the people who had come into the ships ships had come into power to speak with you after the last wave of the galaxy entered Earth . When we was informed , this was the last ship that had been lost . We have lost contact with the *NTL fleet* for so long , but we have seen no conflict . This is what we have done . I will explain this here to you . Every last wave of the fleet will be gone . '' The voice continued again , and the translator returned again . `` They are so far gone now . '' The voice continued again . `` We have been waiting for this long for so long . Humanity has never considered the possibility of winning , and I have had to stand now . '' The voice continued again , and the voice continued . `` Do n't make mistakes , or you may not speak to a hundredth . And you may tell me , now that you have read the message . I have been waiting for him . You must be here now , and I must say I have to say that . Then I will do it . '' The voice continued again , and the voice continued again . `` The last time we destroyed their ship , you destroyed the ship , and I will never forget you . We will not forget you . '' The voice continued again , and again , and again , until it became more frantic . `` You must forgive me . '' The voice continued again , and again , and again , but again , louder . The voice sounded again , a different voice . `` I understand , I have been waiting for so long . '' The voice responded again .   The voice began again , but this time , the voice continued again , and again until it was silent . `` All your mistakes are all I have done . This is not what I came with , but that is what we have achieved . I was just one of the last few years young . You have always wanted me to repeat this , but in one moment , I was strong . You were strong , strong , and strong ; strong . But I have always taught you to forgive me , and that you must forgive me . '' The voice spoke again , and again , not that it sounded like a small thing . The voice did n't say anything . `` I understand . You are my only hope . My choice is yours . It is yours . With this final wave of the galaxy , you will guide me back . Your decision is yours . To come . You will not forget you . '' The voice continued again , and at these times the voice continued again , but it still sounded like a whisper , and again I still could n't remember what had happened .  The voice grew louder . `` Do n't bother , you will not forget me . To come . '' The voice was weak , but it was still
“ You have to be kidding me . I ’ m not going to be able to speak in an inch. ”   “ What ? ”   “ You ’ re not a great artist . That ’ s why you ’ re not going to stop my plans. ”   “ I suppose you ’ re a good artist . You aren ’ t going to be an actor. ”   “ Well , how about that ? ”   “ Your plans will be destroyed. ”   “ I guess that ’ s what I need to say . If you need to do it now , you will be here then. ”   “ But you don ’ t feel like getting the wrong way , you know ? You feel like someone… . ”   “ I should have known… I ’ m just trying to stop it. ”   “ You are just trying to help me. ”   “ Stop it . And you ’ re just trying to help me. ”   “ Stop it . Do you remember how I can take this opportunity ? ”   “ In spite of not being able to stop you from happening. ”   “ I don ’ t know what you ’ re trying to do with all these people. ”   “ Excuse me , I was just trying to stop someone. ”   “ You hurt them. ”   “ Like how ? ”   “ The most important component is that you aren ’ t going to stop them. ”   “ You aren ’ t going to stop us ! ”   “ What would you do if you took a nap ? ”   “ Your plans will be destroyed ! ”   “ I will not liege. ”   “ I ’ m just trying to kill you ! ”   “ No ! NO ! ”   “ Stop it . I will not liege. ” 
* '' This is where it goes ! `` *   * '' The last thing I remember was the stars . `` *   * '' We all seem to be heading towards the next galaxy , sir . `` *   * '' But we do n't know why .

  We have , you see , every one we have killed , is a lie and a lie . But you see , we have , where we are .    It is our end , we have , the moment you are afraid , that we are n't lying . In fact , it is our inevitable hope . Perhaps , we are just monsters trying to gain more information than these things .    We have found , this moment , and our undoing . No , no , I ca n't explain it , you know , it does n't matter . It is our end , we have to stop .    You do n't have to move on . Your decision is yours , but we have to stop . You have to stop now , this moment .    We have to stop .    We have already confirmed our fate , that we will never stop . We will never stop .    You have to stop .    You will stop .    We have to stop you .
The room around it all started to melt away . Everybody around me was still looking for any sign of the events of their relationship , but there 's a big surprise on people faces . The news was about them taking pictures and finding the results . I was a little more curious . The time when I went to a nearby window , I saw a little girl staring at me . She had hair to them .   `` Hey Honey ! '' I heard her through my headphones . I reached out and grabbed her hand . I gave her a wave , and picked her up .   `` Hey honey , can we have a new dinner ? ''   Her voice was cold , and the rest of my friends were staring at me with amazement . They looked as if they were staring at me . Then I saw something in my eyes .   `` Honey , that 's another mistake . We 're going to have to leave , so I 'll leave . ''   With that , the woman started to cry . As the raindrops formed , she threw her hair aside and ran outside to fetch me .    The girl was running outside as she ran away .   The girl , she looked again and looked again .   `` Do n't worry honey , it 's late . You 're getting the usual spot , and just need to make sure you can be okay . If I had n't been so careful , I would have been okay with you by now . ''   I do n't remember much of the time I got to her , but I remember the time I got home that I saw her .   `` The first time I 've got a new job , I 've been so busy , but that 's not how I 'd get to work . ''   I looked around , smiling . I could see that there were things in the room . Things that should n't have been moving , to see things people , in the room .   I saw something in her eyes .   `` I used to think you were okay , then . ''   The girl was staring at me , her eyes wide .   `` That 's just the start of the day . ''   I felt a chill start to run down my spine , but I did n't feel it .   She was screaming . I turned around and saw beautiful flowers , with my pink hair , flowing . In the center of her shirt , I noticed the red stains and yellow marks . She smiled as she walked past me .   `` I 'm sorry honey , it 's late . ''
She was a tall and tall piece of shit and I knew her name .   She is n't a real big man . I 'd known it in years but I know she can not leave the money to me to protect that man . They said on the phone why would they send her this job , why would they send her this job ? They were all on the news , like two fucking people , a man who knows his name . They were all on the news now , and I was about to catch her by turning the fuck up to find her .   `` Um , hello ? How are you ? '' I asked . She 's heard me off the edge of the phone . `` How are you feeling ? ''   `` Sorry . Sorry for being late . ''   `` I 'm calling , '' I said . I saw a black man behind a black hood and a dark figure in a dark suit behind him looked at me with a confused expression on his face . He gave me a look and a look of disbelief and a smile that surprised me .   `` Is this a joke ? What is your real name ? '' He asked .   `` That 's not a joke , '' I replied .   I shook myself , `` Who are you ? '' I asked .   `` Who are you ? What are you talking about ? '' He asked .   `` I am a serial killer , '' I said .   `` I told you , '' the figure answered . I nodded and went towards the door .   She stepped inside and held the gun tightly . A tear streamed down her cheek and I saw a knife sticking out of my hand . I opened my mouth and mouth I breathed in . I did n't know who it was . As I spoke , she stood with the gun aimed a finger at me .   `` I got to see how you got me , '' I said . She stepped out of the black hood and ran off .
`` That 's what they do . The real reason why . '' Dr. Alarm said , stroking his forehead with a small grin .   `` As I stand here , we have n't lost anyone . To put the whole thing out of my mind . ''   Dr. Alarm looked back at the room . There was a huge room , but there was also a box on the wall . A door , or maybe a box ? A door ? A door ? A staircase ? An elevator ? A light ? A room ?

**There ’ s no end . **   “ What do you mean in the woods ? ”   *The leaves and leaves all just want to be . *   “ I mean there ’ s no end , ” said the trees , leaning against the tree .   *The tree is far below us . *   “ Listen at what I mean . I ’ m a tree , ” said the trees , still leaning against the tree . They looked at me , and then back at me .   *The leaves are gone now . *   “ No , I don ’ t want to hurt you . You just want to be there. ”   “ It ’ s not like we ’ ve been here before. ”   “ I didn ’ t care , '' said the trees with a smile . They looked at me as if confused . They were in shock .   *The leaves were gone , and they were gone now . The leaves were gone . *   “ It ’ s not like we ’ ve been there before , ” said the trees , and looked at me .   *The trees ’ s gone now . *   “ Nothing. ” I looked at the ground . The leaves were gone .   *The leaves grew . *
“ What do you think you ’ re looking at ? ”   “ There ’ s no explanation for him , you know. ”   “ What are you talking about ? ” They asked .   “ Are you listening to me more often , then ? ”   “ Yes. ”   “ What do you mean ? ”   “ If you ’ re listening and you can hear me . I ’ m watching you talk about that. ”   “ You can ’ t hear me. ”   “ I ’ m listening. ”   “ You can hear me. ”   “ You can hear me. ”   “ Okay . I don ’ t know , but you can hear me. ”   “ I am watching you talking about that , but I know that you ’ re reading your mind. ”   “ It ’ s not like I ’ ve had a good time. ”   “ I ’ m listening. ”   The two of them sat , watching the table . They sat for a few seconds .   “ So I did that. ”   “ Do you remember anything about that man ? I don ’ t remember anything about that man . He was one of those first few months . I remember feeling that he was a part of me being , too . I remember when he first arrived in the house. ”   The two stared at each other .   “ And what his other friend is looking at ? ”   “ I ’ m still feeling that some people do n't understand. ”   “ But… I remember. ”   “ I was watching him . He never was . He was looking for someone that could hear the thoughts he made . They were all very bright . It wasn ’ t like I did not want to have a face . I did n't want to go back to my room any more , but I did n't want to see him. ”   “ So I don ’ t remember anything about that man. ”   “ I don ’ t remember any details , because I remember something. ”   “ It just was in his room. ”   “ You remember that man . He was looking for someone to notice. ”   “ That man . He was looking for something else . I should have known. ”   “ Maybe you don ’ t know. ”   “ I knew his name. ”   The two closed them in unison . The two opened their mouths and sat staring at each other .   “ I remember I remembered when he first arrived at our house. ”   “ He was looking for a mirror. ”   “ Are you telling me that he could read my thoughts ? ”   “ Yeah. ”   “ He was looking for something else . Are you telling me his thoughts ? ”   “ I remember . I remember vividly. ”   “ Oh , I remember that voice. ”   “ I remember that man. ”   “ It was , because he was looking for something like a mirror . You were looking for someone else. ”   “ What are you saying ? ”   “ He was watching me explain. ”   “ I remember that tone. ”   “ He saw me talking to him. ”   “ I remember the very first time I saw him . He was watching me talk . I remember thinking he was watching me talk. ”   “ Why ? Why did his thoughts get interesting ? Why did he look for someone else… he looked like a mirror ? Did he look like a mirror ? He looked like a mirror ? Why did he look like a face ? ”   “ I did so… I remember the one . He ran over to me. ”   “ He looked like a mirror. ”   The two smiled . They sat at each other .
The man stood in front of him , staring at his watch . It looked as though he had been lost in one swift motion . `` We 've been in contact . Our mission is to remain safe . We make a choice . ''   The man looked at the watch . `` It 's been three minutes now , '' he said , as if he had just been through this . `` What do you mean ? ''   `` You remember that time when my brother died ? We could n't have been that bad . Of course he looked it up , '' the man interrupted . `` He looked it up , and he was grinning . So I do n't know why I was here . ''   `` Right , right . '' He was ready to start looking at the watch . `` It 's just ... it 's just ... it 's just ... gone , right ? ''   You could tell the man had n't asked for a moment .   `` You know , it 's just ... what kind of person makes up these pieces of metal , '' he said , and he nodded .   The man shook his head . `` You know ... it 's just ... it 's just ... moving *inside* it ... out of the equation . Or you know , I mean , it 's moving *inside* it . I mean , it 's kinda *the* thing that makes up these pieces of metal . It 's just ... moving it 's moving *inside* it . It 's moving . It 's moving it 's moving at all , moving in front of it . '' He looked towards the watch . `` It 's moving on . It 's moving too . Over . ''   `` Okay , '' you said . `` I 'll take it back to my brothers like the rest of us . ''   `` So ... we 'll find another person , '' the man said , handing you a handful of coins of coins . `` I can still remember the rest of us . We can move around here without them knowing we 're so close about them . ''   `` Right ... and this is *my* *me . I got to see it . '' He told you . `` *When* you 're here ? ''   `` Right . I have to see what 's going on . '' He walked up to the watch , hand in hand , and put it to his mouth . `` I 'm going to be careful . ''   `` Right . '' He began , as if to say something . `` We can go back to the village and do some research . They 're both ... moving . ''   You could tell the man was breathing . `` Yes , '' he said , with an almost calm voice . `` Okay . They 'll get away before I get home . ''   He looked at his watch . 1 o'clock .   You could n't do that . This was his last time .
Dear Susan ,   It 's been a long time since this happened . I have seen her every day , her eyes , her cheeks , her face and her nose . Sometimes I 'm scared of her , but in truth it 's like a good thing I 've seen her every night . This world has been taking over . The day she 's gone .    Everyone talks about her , of course . But now , though , I have to go to sleep .   I 've never done anything . I do n't know what anyone wants for me . I 've never thought about what I 've ever done , how I 've never played anything with her . I know what I 've done to be here , but but I have n't seen it . Everyone hates her . I know what I hate about my world , but I know the truth .    So when I 've been sick , I 've seen her every day . She 's gone . I know what I 've done to deserve it . I know that she does that . She 's always different . Not like she really hates her world , but like a world she ca n't control . Today the monsters monsters will start over me and I know what I 'm doing to her . I know this . I know how long they 've been waiting , and why my world is so lonely . I know how long they 've got to live , and why I 've been here .    I know I 've never seen her , but I know what she is doing to me . I know I 've been watching , and they do n't want it right . They want it right .    I know I should get her to go . She 's gone . I did n't want it . I know I should have done something .    I know how long I 've been waiting for someone to talk to . I know something , but I know . I know I 'm scared of every person I know , but I know I 've seen it before . There 's nothing wrong with her . I know it 's her , but I know I 'm scared , and I know that . I know what she 's doing to me . I know she was scared , and I know that her eyes are watering now . She 's just missing . I know what it meant to me .    They 'll see . They 'll see . I know what she 's doing . I know she 's making this right now . She 'll see . I know what she 's doing to me . I know what I 'll take to her . I know what I 'm doing to her . I know what I 'm doing to her . I know she 's gone .    I see her . I know she 's gone . I know I know what I 've been doing to her . I know where I 'm going , and how I 'm going to end up here . I know what do to her , but I know it 's not bad enough to know . She 's gone . I know I should have done something , just maybe I should have done something , but it 's something I 'm too angry to say . She 's gone . She 's gone . I know I 'll do anything . I know what I 've done to her .    I know I 'll give her this . I know I 'll let her go again . I know I 'll show her the truth . But I know that when I 'm gone , she 'll see . I know what awaits her . She 'll take the blame , but that 's all I needed . The truth is , I know I 'll do something . I know she wo n't . She 'll find it .    So when I 'm done , we 'll see ...
`` The big man comes home to a family and is n't gon na make it until his daughter comes home and tells him he 'll be at home and he 'll make himself a better life . ''   Adam put his hand on his shoulder . `` It 's the big man , is n't it ? You 're from the middle of nowhere ! Look at it ! ''   Adam got up and walked down the hall . `` Adam , I know you 've got a hole to it , but I 've got to start with this . I 'm already on the edge it will be fine , but I 've got to climb . I 'll let you know that the big man is n't supposed to be able to hide this place ! ''   Adam walked around the hall and took a deep breathe and walked to the gate . This would still be his last adventure , but he knew he had to be a decent guy . He ran to the gates and was greeted with a warm air . He checked his suit . He saw that he was wearing some sort of suit he had never seen before .   `` It 's so cool you do n't know what the big man is doing , '' Adam said as he pushed the door into the living room . `` I 'll take an easy walk and you know that you 're going to be the big man . ''   The dark man followed Adam to the big man and took off his suit .   `` Adam , stay your hand in the big man . I 'll let you know . ''   The old man grabbed the door and stepped into the living room . He looked around until he noticed a man was holding a cigar . `` I 'm sorry ? '' Gary asked .   `` I 'm sorry sir , I know that 's not how I feel. ''   `` Well , it 's just that big man . You 're going to take a lot of money for the big man . You 're going to be right off the side of the house . ''   The old man took a deep breath and then continued to get a little more comfortable . He picked up a little piece of paper and tossed it to the ground .   `` You 'll have to leave , '' Adam said as he tucked it away . `` Remember me ? ''   The old man started to scroll on the paper . `` It 's probably the big man , we 'll get to it this time . ''   The old man went back to the little man and smiled .   The old man took another long pause . `` Good afternoon ... *You 're just another big man , '' he said as he handed the papers to the old man . `` I 'll just have to start a new career , do n't you ? ''   The old man set the paper out and slowly walked up to a table . He walked out and found a paper . `` It 's important , '' he said as he stared at a stack of paper . The fat man scratched at it and said , `` This one does n't make it difficult and does n't make it hard . ''   The old man took the paper from the table and held it in one hand . `` I hope you stay with me today . So , let 's see what we 'll have to do . ''   `` Okay , okay ... *Why wo n't you leave ? How do you go to the big man ? We 'll be the big man . ''   Adam walked over to the man and walked to the tiny man . He looked looked at him and said , `` I ... I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm not going to be a big man , I do n't want to be a big man . ''   The old man reached for the note and read it , `` Go on . ''   The old man walked away . `` I 'll see that later in the next week ! ''   The old man nodded and stood up . `` Thank you , I 'm so sorry . ''   Adam walked back into the living room and quickly walked into the living room . The woman did n't come home to the big man , she just walked up to the small man .   `` Do you understand what happened then ? '' The old man asked as he ran out the door .   The old man sat in the living room until he made it into a small room where he and the old man stared at him for several minutes before finally letting go of something inside . He walked through some small room and opened the door . There was
I was startled and looked into the face of an impossibly handsome man in a navy white jumpsuit with the yellow light on the horizon . I heard no voice , just a voice on the other side of the cliff .   `` Wh-what are you talking about , now ? I-I do n't know . That 's a funny thing , I 'm talking to you . ''   “ Well , I 'm talking to you , ” said the tall girl sitting on a bench . Her face was dark and dark in his eyes . I nodded nervously , her face turning to the tall girl at the second .   “ Not today , ” I said , trying to catch her attention .   “ Look at you , ” said the tall girl , “ If you 've ever told me you could n't tell me how to tell you this one , that 's the kind of thing that you 're talking. ”   I nodded politely , holding back my two bays . The hoor in the sunlight reflected the sun , the pale green of a thousand suns streaming down on the horizon as the soft breeze blew through the trees . The tall man sat next to me , crinkling in his hands as if he 'd just lifted a hand .   “ What 's on , boy ? ” I asked , holding back my two bays . The tall girl looked at the tall girl with a small frown . “ But it 's not the kind of thing you have to tell you. ”   “ I 'm talking to you , now , ” said the tall girl . “ Did you just tell someone else that the guy is a killer ? I want to tell you that this guy is a serial killer. ”   “ That he is a killer. ”   “ Well , actually that 's not quite a story , ” said the tall girl . “ But I guess that 's what he gets for me. ”   I paused , wondering if she saw me , then looked at the tall girl with a deep frown .   “ You 're talking to me , ” said the tall girl . “ And when he leaves , you have me. ”   “ I 'm talking to you , ” said the tall man .   “ Actually , I 'm talking to you , ” said the tall man .   I frowned , not sure if this was some sort of joke . The tall girl was pretty and shy .   “ Did you tell someone you killed and he made some of the rocks ? Did you tell them I was in the middle of an ambush ? ”   “ Was that what I said ? That 's all something about him and he 's not going to ask you of me , ” said the tall man .   I shrugged . “ That 's a story . I 'm talking to you , and he 's talking to me. ”   “ Do n't tell him that I 'd kill himself , ” said the tall girl . “ I thought he 'd kill himself ? But he 's a loser. ”   “ But I got a job , and I was going to kill myself so I ran away. ”   “ So you just said , ” said the tall man , “ and then why are you here ? ”   “ Because I 'm here , ” he said , eyeing the tall girl with a sly smile . “ I 'm talking to you , so I 'm talking to him. ”   “ You 're not talking to me , ” said the tall man , “ And I do n't even know if I 'm talking to that guy . Just tell him that it 's just a trick of him , I know he 's like you did n't think we 'd do anything about it . And when he leaves , he wants to die , but he does n't think he 's going to think I 'm crazy , and even if I 'm talking to him I would think I 'm crazy . But he 's also going to kill himself and he 's going to kill himself . Maybe that 's why I 'm calling him , because he 's just going to kill me . I mean , he 's going to kill me if I ask him and he can do crazy things there , because he 's going to kill me . And
`` Look , '' I said , looking around the room . I was looking for my friend . It was obvious he was n't in there . I looked at the window and saw the sign . `` It says `` It says `` The sun has not touched anything '' . I saw his eyes twinkling back and forth in confusion and confusion . I remembered all those years ago , he was scared . I had to warn him . He was , I was scared ... but I could n't . I decided to warn him .  I got up and went to the bathroom . `` Come on , '' I said , turning around . The door shattered and the walls disintegrated . I saw the man slumped over and down at the door . He was crying .  I decided to push through . He wanted to stop crying . I only wanted to stop crying .  I tried to push him out . He was crying . I did n't know what is happening , and I could n't help but laugh . He was yelling . He was yelling . He jumped from exhaustion and I tried to get out of bed . He was crying . I started to cry .  I started to cry because even after I felt alive I was going to shake . He did n't . I loved everyone , and he wanted to stop dying and live and die and die . He never said anything . I did n't want to , so I thought .  I looked around the room and saw everyone , smiling . I saw the man 's face and he tried trying to make me cry . I cried because I should n't . I did n't want to die . I tried to talk and he just kept crying . I opened my eyes and saw the man go on .  He started crying . I saw his eyes twinkling back and forth . I screamed . He was crying . He cried because I got back out of bed , and I cried because I knew what I was doing and what I was doing . In fact he was crying , because I ca n't kill .  He stopped crying .  I ran , and ran . I ran , and ran . I ran . He ran , but I was n't there anymore . I ran through the window . I screamed because I did n't . I ran and ran and ran . I ran and ran . I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran . I ran and ran . I ran too . I ran . It hurt me . I ran .  
I was going to try a new tactic on Facebook to Google . There was something that was going perfectly out of my eyes , something that was n't the best time to learn .   All my data would be on Facebook for years , maybe even months . By the time I bought a new app my eyes had been upgraded with less specific emotions than I should ever have . As I thought I had developed my brain was all too familiar with my body and mind . My eye opened slowly to the side of my eye and a small small lump of saliva appeared on my mouth .   There was no way to tell . I had no idea what I looked exactly like . As I saw the scar on my throat , that something was missing .   My arms and legs were as big as the others . I had no idea how they had been up there for the last time . They were mostly from a small group of friends , but she just kind of had to have a smile .   The others that were up there were all too familiar with each other until the end . I wondered what I looked like . There was just one thing I did n't think about . 
My name is Steven B.E . I did n't think it would happen to me . So I went through this routine once an hour , just barely making the progress to get on the front page . What should I do ? Nobody else is watching . I do n't care . No one else does . There 's no one else to watch me . Everyone is watching me . I do n't know what they 're watching . I do n't know what they 've just watches and do n't think it 's funny because of the sudden surge , but they just watch and watch . Finally I realise I can feel a deep feeling in me .   I 'm sitting on the lawn , watching someone else die their eyes and then I look away . She 's sitting there and I do n't know how to explain it but I do know why she wants to go on , and that makes my mind churn .   It begins with a satisfying *thud* . I know it 's too late for me . I 'm just taking the time to realise now that I can do this alone . I can see that her body is still there . It 's the same body I used to be . I could do it if I had n't . The others are watching , even if I wanted to . Maybe I was . I can do this right ?   But that 's when I saw her . I am a woman . I can do this right . She 's been watching me for a while , and with a smile on her face . I know she might care . And I 'm sitting there staring at her , staring at her . She looks at me , and I see her . They do n't acknowledge my presence .   `` You could n't ignore me . I wanted to go on ... it was n't funny . I did n't know what I would n't , but he was just watching me with him . I wanted to jump . I wanted to go on . ''   She 'll continue   **CLICK : ** There 's something I can do . I can do this right . I can do this right now . I ca n't do this right now . I can do this right anyway . I 've won to go on . And now my entire life is over . Now the world is over . I 'm finally sitting on the lawn , waiting for my turn . I 'm staring at the window . And I am finally at peace .   ***CLICK : ** The man looks at me , the exact same expression on his face .   `` What are you doing ? ''   I blink .   He 's staring at me . He looks away , but he 's already looking at me . His eyes are still fixed on mine , and he pulls back his tongue in mine , and he squeezes it back . I can hear him gasp .   `` I ... I did n't even know ... '' he repeats .   I let out a deep sigh .
`` The End ! '' The bell chimed loudly , and the old man swung open the door .   'Mr . President , ” his aide pleaded .   The old man sighed and shook his head nervously .   “ Did you actually say , sir ? I was n't expecting you . I know this is a rhetorical question , but I will ask you a question . I do n't know , I know I am just a figment of reality , but we must really ask our questions . I am just a figment of reality . If you ever do , you must do something . When we all agree you shall not . You , Mr. President , will not let us in .

The first time I had seen him was the first time I had seen him . I was n't sure how long I 'd been with him at all . I suppose I had been stuck in a cave with long , dirty , wet trails and mud . He 'd spent a few minutes with his friends and I 'd see him like I was about to die . Maybe I would have to drink it . Or after all .   The first thing I noticed was a red smudge of color , and I could n't help but notice the spots on his face . He could tell . I tried to read it . I think he was trying to figure out how to be true . I tried to read it again , but I tried to take a look . It tried to hide .   The next time I was looking forward to it , I saw a group of them . Their faces were filled with blood , and they began to move . They were covered in blood while the group dropped to the ground , almost inaudible . They were almost as white as the others , so I could n't escape through death . I felt a hand upon my cheek .   I opened my book and found a spot next to the pool of blood . I opened it and saw a face , which was covered in stains on it . I looked down at the blood . I had seen a girl , not a single mother , a few years older than that , with a small knife with silverware in it . She was holding a knife in her hand . He held it back and looked at me and said , `` Just give her away from me . ''   He looked at me . `` What ? ''   `` I 'm sorry . '' He said .   `` It does n't concern you . ''   I held the knife up and the girl looked back at me . `` But I 'm a murderer . '' I said .   `` It does n't change anything . '' He said . `` But you must understand . I 'm a murderer . '' He started to walk away from me , but I started to feel the hunger increase in my hunger . I could n't even see the face .   It was my daughter . The boy was my daughter . She was a man that I 'd never seen before .   I heard a deep rumble on the floor and I looked at the face . `` This is n't possible . '' She pointed at my hand . I looked at her . `` Now I 'm afraid I will get away from you . '' She let out a scream and the girl ran away . He turned and looked at me .   My daughter turned . `` The world is ending . '' She said . `` I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . ''   I looked at her , and saw her .   `` So ... '' She said and said , `` I 'm sorry . ''   She looked at my hand and smiled , then opened her mouth . She let out another scream and said without continuing .   `` Oh , I can still stop . '' I said as I closed her mouth and made my way out the door . I stayed up .
Dear life , I have n't had an idea at all . I 'm here for a long time , working in a place of opportunity , always planning on getting my experience . Sure , this world is a long and long way out of it . If you 'd like to enjoy a bit more time , you probably should buy a bit of time away . When did you get your experience ? That 's how it started .   You know I told you the dream to be good and bad ; I am sick and tired of leaving it useless . But hey , you know , I am dying of sleep but my legs are too weak and I feel the pain is killing me . In my head , I do the only thing I can do .   The only thing I can do is watch my dreams drift through the darkness . Sometimes , when I wake up , the only thing I can do is sit there . I was tired of drinking . I was lonely now , I never thought I was ever so happy because of a dream . It 's a dream , that 's what it takes for you to get into my own own life .   Do n't dream again . I have been dreaming since I had a single good dream . Do n't dream again and again . Sometimes , it 's getting more complex . Sometimes , I wonder if I 'm having a real life anymore . After all , if I 'm dreaming then I can still dream again . You 'll never be able to get rid of the pain again and again and again but there 's nothing I can do . You probably deserve what it takes for me to get rid of .   Do n't forget .   I have no idea that this is where you 're going .   I already know that I know . I know that somehow , once I feel at peace , I will make peace at first but now I 'm on my way out . I 'm not that good anymore .   Goodbye .   My whole life is ending . It 's pretty simple . I never knew how I felt like it .   So much ... it was so surreal . Life is n't much different . Or , it was just like it would have been . A lot of years ago , you were all about to be remembered .   I only knew the thought that I was an imaginary friend . I do n't know where my dreams come from . I would just be remembered . But I 'm not that good . So much more . So much more . I could n't deal with anything . I 'd never knew how many things I 'd had before . I only knew how many things I could have without , and I did n't have to know what they were doing .   But , *was* that what I feel ? That 's when the idea started . I 'm glad that the world did n't change exactly .   I 'm sad . I 'm hungry then .   I did n't know what to do . Why do n't you just get rid of the pain ?   You leave me alone .   I did n't care . I knew I could need it and I 'm not that bad . I 'm just that ... right .   I just know I 'm here for a long time and then I know the real world . I 'm here to see how it started .   I 'm here for a long time and then I want what I 've been doing .   I 'm here for a long time . And I 'm here for a long time .   I ca n't stay here forever . I just promise that I wo n't wake up until I die .
“ I guess it 's not good . But I have no idea what they found , at least we 've just been on our way through some kind of bureaucratic process of punishment , and if I count the people I know , I 'll guess I ’ ll tell you the more about the future . We 'll try to kill each other , but that 's not fair . We 'll try to help but not just because I 'm not as quick as you can , and at least you get to know where to go . I know I can help you to the afterlife , so many people who could be on your way . It 's for sure . You try to act like a big hitman , but I just want you to know better . So , that 's why the people here put down the wrong crime ? Well , you 're not really interested in violence , not without a bit of a problem and a good relationship . I am not sure which one you see in the past . I 'll give you a chance , but I really kind of accept it . I know some people are here , you know exactly how I feel about it . But , at least what 's the harm in the world ? It may as well well been able to help you make someone else see it . But , maybe I should know what happened to us . The people who told us they had done a whole good deed . The people who made me up for this crime in a manner that would n't have messed with me . They 'd been right about God , and I guess that 's what I 'm looking forward to . So , I just put it back on , so you think that about a good thing ? I know how I feel about it , but , that 's a good thing . That 's the kind of thing that is , but , if you just kill them , so , you can make me feel like I 'm telling you about the people who put others who kept with me .   I 'm not used to their choices , or so I 'm trying to help them , but someone else is . I 've been so distracted it 's so much . It 's easier to see and work . I 've done my things , but I am still trying to understand and think , and it 's only a matter of time before I can tell you what happens . I tried to do as they would , but the others who did n't understand my mistakes were like nothing . I tried to make this a better time , and that 's all wrong . I tried to make a better time , but I 'd tried to convince myself , sometimes , for those who did n't believe me . Some people I worked too hard with , and I 'd tried to make them seem sad . But those who had helped helped me . They were n't angry .    And I know how much easier it is to concentrate around finding a solution . Once I get a promotion , I 've put my body back back in a few lives . I 've given up hope , and the people who helped me die would be happy . We 'd even made everything over again , even a few of those who did n't believe me . I 've been chosen for quite some time , and I know I 'm not wrong . I know how much better this is . That 's why the people who were killed , and it 's why I 'm not mad . I tried to make them smile , but I failed . I tried to make them laugh , but I could n't show them . At least I could have tried to make this many times . They gave me hope . I tried to make sure I was different , but I had n't made an effort to make them laugh . I could n't show them how much better it was to keep them happy . There was n't a point in being in a bad way , and I was thankful for being able to do something else .    But , now , I just want to push myself to the other side of the jury . Something about this is what I was looking forward to to , and I do n't know what . I do n't know what to do at all . I do n't know who is , but I do not know why I 'm here . If I do n't , my decision will be taken . It 's the nature of that . Even though I can manage to figure out my decision , I 'm not sure . I know what to do , because I do n't quite know what to do with it . I simply want to think about having to do so . It 's not just me . I just want to be back to my life . I want to be back to my life .    I '
I had n't seen him come , for what seemed like forever .   He 'd already passed away , the only time he 'd ever have made it into the world that he was n't willing to allow it to happen .   I could n't help but look over at the man on the other end of the table and notice my presence before him . I could n't help but notice his presence , a faint smile , a smile .   `` Just wait until I go home '' he said .   I was n't sure where he was coming from , but I recognized my own voice as his own . Perhaps he seemed right , I thought . He looked up at me and began crying . I had n't been able to stop him from crying , I only had a worried expression upon me .   `` Someone , that 's like , should n't you ? I 'll be there . '' I finally managed to quill .   I was n't sure how he just heard me , let alone the most painful smile I 've ever seen , even though I did n't move .   I was n't sure who he was , but I could n't help but nod .   As I ran to the kitchen , he had a look of surprise on his face and realized I was n't wearing a suit like that , but he could n't understand what I was doing .   I was starting to feel like I belonged to all of the people I 've ever seen , but I had n't even seen in a while . I was still on this mission ; I 'd been planning this , but now I had no idea what I was going to do .   I had planned that .   I had n't expected to do anything wrong . I had planned that . I would be here , and I would be there , ready to go .   The man was n't lying , but I knew I had n't done anything wrong . I was on this mission , the first thing I 'd done . I was going to see my friends .   I did n't know what I had planned . I had planned that . I had planned that .   Now I had to do something wrong , to put the mission back to the world .   `` You were right , I 'll explain '' the man replied and he pressed the button as he stared at me with those empty eyes sockets . I was shocked .   I would have done anything wrong .   `` No ... no no- you always did . You always did . You always did . You always did . You always do . You always did . You always did . You always did . Always did . They always do . ''   I smiled at him , but he got up , and walked away . I made a choice .   I was getting ready .   I was going to see my friend again .  
I was a great old man . After years , I was all that could imagine , a great old man and a great old man . It was nice to see you at all times , but I was able to get you a new life . Life was great .   I did n't think of the great old man , either . I looked like a great old man , but I was so old now , so old , so old , so old .   I was just a kid . A great old man . Always being good . Now , after years of hard work , I grew bored of the world . Back then , I was born . As I became old , I was lonely . Soon , there were no more people who cared longer .   I grew bored of the life I was in . I was never the sort of person to truly change the lives of our people , and I was a great man . I was n't the kind of person that did n't make sense , but then , he said `` what 's going on ? '' . I was glad we realized we could n't be so old . He said `` if everyone else is going to be happy , they will be happy too . ''   I looked back . I was a great old man . I looked at his book , but I was n't in it . I did n't recognize what the book was . I did . He put his book in my pocket , and said `` you 're okay . '' .   And then , I saw that the old man had seen me . I started to realize , but it was not me . I was still a great old man , it was a great old man . It was one of those eyes that I had never seen as small as me .   This whole family had chosen me . I was the kind of person that is the kind of person in the world . So old , so old , so old . I was still an old man . I had lived this long , long enough to have been normal . I was in the deep and lonely world with long , long , long enough to see the world that I lived .   I was a great man . I was the great old man again . I had saved my life , and was forever happier . I grew bored of his existence , and now my life was so old that I was able to see him again .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I was at home , with my family looking at me . I was at my house , and I was in the middle of the street , feeling everything I wanted . Everything I wanted , everything I wanted .

The sun was far too bright , and the way the stars were out there at the moment were dark and the warmth of the sun was still visible through the Martian sun . Slowly , the moon reached a different angle , and it went dark . Not dark . Not dark . No light . No light . Just barren . The same moon that was just so bright . But it was n't dark . The Sun was dark . It was dark . But there was no light . The sunlight was bright . And it still did ... I wonder . Maybe the moon was light . The moon ? It ... Whatever it was . It was me . There was no light . Did I say something ? Then , after a few minutes , suddenly , it took me no longer to realise . I was naked . What was that ? What was that ? What was that ? We had run out of the moon . But now it was darkness . It was red . I was alive . I was dead . It was the sun . Yet I thought . I had never dreamed . I stared at it ; I 'm alive . The sun is brighter now and I am alone . I am alone . What is that . I 'm alone . Nothing . Nothing . Nothing is gone . I walk and see nothing . Nothing . Nothing .

The dragon fluttered through the haze of smoke . A large hole in his chest , as he landed on the ground , it was so thick that he could n't see what it was . The size of its head made him feel dizzy , and so black he could feel it 's claws protruding from the hole .   `` And now here you are . ''   `` So now you are the last human alive , the rest of our world , where we are , and the only one who can make me wish you to see me . ''   `` Who ... why would have you ... ''   `` What ? ''   `` You do n't know what I 'm talking about . Just tell me that I know what I 'm talking about . ''   `` It 's all a story . Any story ? ''   `` Who was n't you ? You . We thought we were gon na fly around and die . ''   `` And what ? ''   `` And where ? ''   `` You told me that we were gon na fly around , and could n't fly around because you did n't get around . You told me that you were going to be stranded without food and water . You told me that you were going to be trapped in a bunker in the mountains , and that we get out of the way , because you 're gon na fall around and die . And that 's what we do . ''
Some kids never really understood the rules . Nothing ever came out for one . No matter how much you hate the game , not because you have everything on your mind to do for yourself , you are always going to have to deal with it .   `` Go on . Go on . ''   `` Go to your room and the other kids ? ''   `` Nah , I don ’ t know what 's going on . I don ’ t know what I ’ d like . ''   `` Alright , it ’ s just a game . You have a whole new game . ''   “ What ? Are you really going to have to play a game ? They ’ re all like you . ''   “ You have something more to ask yourself . If I get into trouble , I ’ ll be with you. ”   `` Okay , yeah , I ’ m ready to go . ''   `` I ’ ll figure it out . Maybe it ’ s not like you wanted to , just because of what I wanted to do with me , I ’ m the king , where she says I won a table. ”   “ Fine . Go to my room and I ’ ll get through the next phase , where I can play a deck with a single deck . I ’ m still in the room , but it ’ s not so big for me anymore . You ’ ll see , because of how I still get here . If I get into trouble , why don ’ t you go to my room and wait ? ”   “ Go to my room and take another look at all these guys . You know , right ? It ’ s just a game . Maybe I can play a game more than one. ”   “ Alright , I won , if I can not . ''   Even though it was getting annoying last night , I don ’ t know how bad that was , but that was just enough .   `` So , what happens next ? ”   “ What do you mean ? ”   “ You ’ re going to sit on the table , and do some of the jokes , all like you ’ ll ever see. ”   “ I won the table. ”   “ I ’ m going to play a game . ''   `` So , what do you want ? ”   “ Well , before you can play all these poker games , I want to live a full life . ''   “ So , when does this start ? ”   “ Well , I have my game then . My game is just pretty fucked up. ”   “ Here ’ s what I wanted to do . I can play , you know ! ”   `` Alright , what , a game I would like to do with you ? ”   “ Fine . But , I just want to play the game… ”   “ What ? What ? Wait , what ? But , what a game I have to play ? ”   `` Nothing . I want to play a game with you. ”   “ So , what if I won the table ? Why would I play that game ? ”   “ How ? ”   “ Why would I play the table ? ”   “ I don ’ t understand… ”   “ I had a game that I could use , I suppose . Come back to my room and make a game of cards . I want to play the whole game . I want you to go . I want you to play and hold it in my hands . You want me to play . That ’ s why I go to your room and pick the table with your hands . I want you to play the game ? ”   “ What if I won the table ? ”   “ Okay , fine . You have a game of cards and we ’ ll try to play a game of cards , so I want you to get a game of cards , so you can play a game of cards with your hands here. ”   “ I have the Game , so I can play a game with your hands unless you decide to play the game with my hands . I want you to play the game as well ? ”   “ Hey , let ’ s play
I thought the news was going to report some kind of phenomenon that everybody had come to a close life . Everyone was wondering what happened in it too , who chose to be `` the most powerful hero in history '' or `` the most powerful person in history . '' This is when it hit me . I know in my dream I have been told to work with an artist , and all of the major organizations and major organizations have started working together , and I have decided to use my power for me to make the most powerful person in history . I have been told that I have already given every major super power in humanity , I have not worked for power .   People are able to figure this out , and I should never use it . I have already seen some sort of supernatural power that I have left behind some sort of magic trick that my own subconscious desires it is only a matter of time before I turn a corner . These powers may be a thing , but I have done something horrible to my conscious , and I have felt powerful , while I have always tried . It is all because of a real power , and I have used it for years . But today , I have known the story of every terrorist , and since I have mastered the power of the person I could tell it is enough to be done .   I 'm almost there , watching the news . I have tried to create the right power , but my subconscious wants to become a part of my body . I would have to tell people I am crazy , and my most powerful power is to stay at night , and watch the news . The news has become a huge tragedy , and I can tell people I am crazy , but my world is getting darker and darker .   I know that I have to get up to get ready for the next few weeks . If only I can stop the news from happening . I can see the news clearly that the worst power I have ever seen , but the worst power I have never seen has been unleashed . I have just been told that this is no ordinary power , and I have been told that this is a mistake , and no one knows why , but it would be worse if I could , and the power I have given it to me is like this for my own good . I have been told that I am not crazy , but it does n't matter .   Well guess what , I have something to change . I 've always been told it will make me sick . I have become a part of my subconscious , and that I simply have n't done anything wrong . For sure I have to tell people I know .
I can still remember the training we had spent as a training instructor for my class . I heard the class shuffle to the left and then I heard a faint sound and then a familiar noise . The young lad 's eyes widened slightly and turned to me as I held the stroller over my head .   `` Excuse me , lad . '' I said to myself as I took in my surroundings . I can see the young boy staring at me .   `` Um ... well , hi . '' I said to my instructor as I walked towards the other students .   `` What are you looking for ? '' He asked while he looked away . I was n't sure if he was trying to see where he was .   `` I have an idea , lad . '' I said as I approached the young boy .   `` Well , I thought of my father now . '' He said with a grin . `` Well.. well , sure your father would be safe . You were like me . '' He said with a smile . `` We 'll move into battle with you this time . '' he said with a smile .   I turned to see the young man . `` Yes , yes . '' he said as he turned back to me and returned to his seat . I looked around my room . It was empty and empty . This was really odd . The young man was in a different way . He was looking for inspiration .   `` You remember that ? '' I asked as I walked out of the building .   `` Yes , sir . '' He said with a grin . `` I remember when we were kids up on the roof and I remember seeing you wearing some clothes ! ''   I grinned as I walked in . He was looking for inspiration . I almost ran out for a second before I heard a soft , booming sound .   A bright light shone in the room . The young man was looking longingly at me .   `` What happened ? '' I asked as I pushed him forward and took off my pants .   `` I remember taking care of my father . '' He said .   He looked at me with a wide smile . He turned away and turned back to me .   `` Are you sure ? '' He asked as he shook his head .   `` No , my father . '' I said .   `` Uh ... '' He said and gave a warm smile .   `` And I remember being a teacher ? '' He asked as I walked out of the building , looking at the boy on the ground .   `` Yes . '' I said , and I came back out of the building , and followed him out . I saw the boy on the ground and then in the middle of the street he saw me standing .   `` My father , as I am you . '' He said confidently . `` I remember being a teacher for the last three years . ''   I smiled in my face . `` But it 'll be alright . '' I said as I walked up to my chair .   He picked up his glasses . He had a very good look on his face as he looked back .   I walked up to the boy and said , 'What happened ? '   He gave me a quick look and walked towards my father .   When he walked past me I had a very nice look on his face . He stopped at the boy with a smile . It was n't a smile , there was something he had n't seen , right now . I looked at him and he nodded . The boy ran away . I walked towards him and hugged him so hard it felt better .   I felt as though he was closing in . I did n't know what he was going to do .   I slowly walked to his room and held out a hand . I looked away and made my move back toward him . I could smell the smell of the fresh air .   `` So this is happening ? '' He asked .   The boy pointed to a girl I recognized . She had blond hair like that . Her teeth looked very good . She looked so good .   `` I remember the training when we used our training . '' I said when I looked at her .   `` But you 're always on class . '' She said .   `` Yes ! '' I said .   `` No , I remember the training . '' She said as she backed away from me .   She said , 'Yes . ' 
I 'm not sure how I 'm going to describe this type of thing - I 'd written it , but I came to be with them all at once .   A small , middle level of a well-dressed man who appeared to be standing around a man with no way of knowing what else to do . He seemed so confused at the fact that it was the least important thing separating him from the table . If I had n't spoken , I would n't have thought about it .   So I went to the computer , where I was playing with my parents .   `` You can check out /r/Inconvenience ! You have to pick out /r/Inconvenience ! ''   But there was something peculiar about my friends , they were all alone now . My dad , who wore a simple glasses and a t-shirt and a pair of shorts . I could tell by the look on his face that the whole room was about to be empty .   My mom finally stood up , `` I *gigg* '' she said , her eyes wide . `` I 've written my heart for many hours , just as your hands were mine . Please , leave me alone ! ''   I was overcome with fear . I had just gone to sleep in the cold sweat of my night .   I was so consumed by a sense of desire that I could n't breath .   My mom finally took my hand , and I had only been for 2 months .   I had to go to the bathroom to find her , or use it . My mom had to pull me out of the toilet , where my mom was doing it .   She cried .   It was her fault that we were too late .
`` Ah , I 'm a monster . ''   `` What have you been doing ? ''   A rasp sounded in the closet . The small figure was not looking back .   `` Oh , yes . I 'm sorry , but you did n't know . Last night I 'd been ... drunk and drunk , and what you did . I did n't think you 'd come home here . ''   A smirk grew on his face .   `` Well , I suppose it was just that I was n't ... drunk . That was a real . I have a good feeling for you . And I was hoping you like it . ''   The monster hesitated for a moment . He turned .   `` That was n't even a dream . Well , I was n't really drunk . '' His voice was low .   `` Yes , I did . ''   `` Oh , and that was . ''   `` That should have been a dream . ''   `` Yeah , but that 's true , is n't it ? ''   `` It 's true , you know . ''   `` I guess that 's true . Not sure what that is , but it 's true . ''
The man entered the coffee shop for the first time has arrived . His hands were stained with sweat , and so did the man . He had to be seen by an older man , but he was n't sure whether he was seeing the man 's face . The old man 's eyes were fixed on the man .   The man shook his head and shook his head . He did n't remember how this happened , and the man had n't said anything much .   `` Not much of a name for you to ask , '' he said , his eyes wide with concern . He was n't sure what had to be said , but it seemed to do .   `` They say *the* name for *The* name for *The* name for *The* name for *The* name for *The* name for *The* name for *The* name for *The* name *The* name for* *The* name for *The* Robert . `` *It* is *The* name for *The* name for *The* names for* *The* name for *The* names for *The* name for *The* names for *The* names for *The* name .

'' he said , smiling solemnly at the man .   The man was the type , he felt confident .   `` *The* name for *The* name for *The* Robert , '' he growled , and he was sure that he was talking .   `` *The* Robert . `` , the man read in the same spot . His cheeks were red and he was nearly tempted to hold his breath in the air .   `` *The* Name for *The* Robert for *The* name for *The* Robert for *The* name for * The* name for *The* Robert with *The * name for *The* Robert for *The* Robert Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for ** Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert Robert for * The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for * The* Robert for *The* One by *The* of *The* Robert Robert Robert for *The* Robert for * * The *** Robert for * The* Robert for *The* Robert for * The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *That* Robert the* Robert for *The* *The* Robert would always be *The* Robert for *The* Robert for *The* Robert *The* .

`` Dad..why do you think that is ? '' the woman asked , her hair quivering in fear . She was dressed like a ragged sweater , and she had a mask covering her face with the tears of tears , so it looked like an unkempt beard that appeared to be dripping from her eyes . A man behind the mask asked :   `` Yes , yes , I do . I like to play with you , and have a nice night . ''   The doctor stood here , eyes fixed on the woman . `` Yes , '' he said , leaning close to his face , `` but no.. I 'm afraid that you need to leave . ''   `` Why did n't you come in ? '' the doctor asked .   `` Because I like to talk , '' the man said , `` but I want to hug you and call you *real* . I want to hug you . ''   The woman smiled at him , and the woman nodded , knowing what to say . `` I love you , and I loved you very much . Please . ''
The warmth of the sun was unbearable , but it always lingered , the warmth , and the warmth of the sun turned to a puddle of warm , warmness . The sunlight grew nearer and closer , until it became abundantly clear and quiet and clear .   The sun was dying , and I do n't think I 'm going to do anything better than sit there for a long time , to feel the heat of the sun rising in the sky . I do n't know what to expect . I do n't know if I can do something else , but I 'm determined .   I do n't know if I can do anything better tomorrow than the light of day . My mind is going to be racing through my mind : the sun is dying , and I do n't know if it 's going to go better tomorrow !   I 'm going to get home , and I 'm going to be late , and I do n't want to be late in the morning . I do n't know if things 'll be alright .
`` I was going to miss you all , '' said the man . He was in a red suit playing a song on his headset over the radio .   They were dressed in white and white with black stripes . He had a high-backed shirt that looked like a lion .   He was wearing a black t-shirt and blue trousers .   `` I thought you were joking . ''   Everyone in the room looked perplexed .   `` Are you crazy ? ''   `` Because you do n't want to be crazy here . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because I 'm insane . I 'm crazy . ''   The man laughed - it was a joke .   `` It is to be true . ''   The video started playing .   The man did n't laugh a second time - he ran his fingers across his face .   The man 's eyes narrowed - he was wearing a black shirt and a button up shirt .   `` Take the tickets ! '' said the man .   He looked at the controller in the hand and pointed at him .   The man stood before him for a moment before the music hit .   `` Hello , '' said the man . `` You 're a singer . ''   The man looked at the guitar that had been playing .   `` What 's your current song ? ''   The man froze the music in his hand .
`` Hi , who 's that ? '' she asked .   `` Sire , where 's your mother ? '' the little girl asked .   `` I 'm the Grim Reaper . Oh , a lot to worry about . ''   `` Wait , what 's your name ? ''   `` My name is Mary . ''   `` My name 's Babel , what 's my name ? ''   `` I 'm the Grim Reaper . ''   `` You see I do n't think I 'm actually Death , I 'm the Grim Reaper . Oh god , what do you mean ? ''   `` Oh no , I 'm here for you . You 'd think there 's a pretty good reason for me here . ''   `` I 'm here for you , Death , I can , but I 'm here for you . You 'll get the job done , and you 'll see the Grim Reaper on your own . '' 
I was on stage when a girl walked by the door to be my first customer , so I stayed .   I ran a hand over her golden hair with a touch of red . She had a black dress , and had a pink dress with a golden gold necklace , which I had long since forgotten about . It was a blue dress , which was very nice to me , and definitely a green dress .   I walked in the doorway , and sat against the glass . She looked at me with an intense smile . She seemed to be talking to my wife as she walked out of the store , and I wanted to get her to go check the clothes .   It did not matter that I had been given a gift when I was in the city streets . There was a huge chain , which kept me from becoming a man . He looked like he had been taken stealing an oil bucket for a very long time , so I continued walking and thinking about how he would steal an oil bucket .   I decided they were all in the city at night , so I agreed to meet my wife .   They were waiting for me .   Suddenly this man began to run , screaming `` what 's wrong ? Are you looking at me ? ! '' then suddenly he shoved me in .   He stopped running and looked at me . I must have stopped me . We were all in the city when we were kids .   `` Who are you ? '' I asked .   She looked at me with a look of relief .   Confusion flooded her face .   `` You 're here , are you ... . ''   `` I do n't want to ! '' She said .   I had already had the power to make this man 's life better . I was trying to fix this man 's life , and I knew I had to leave him happy .   I ran back to my parents house and headed for the door . I had heard the door close , when a woman came in .   She was standing in front of me , as if she had a huge hand , and her hand was covered with a red cloth . She held it in place and walked towards me , looking at me with sad eyes . I gave her a puzzled look .   `` Sorry , I 'm scared . '' She said .   I looked up , and opened the door behind me . She was holding her hands in front of me . Confusion washed over me .   `` Can I help you ? '' I asked , confused .   She looked at me for the first time in my life . She looked at me with confusion .  `` Yes , I have an interest . I 'm a good person . '' She said .   `` Please , help me , '' she said .   I was left alone in the alley .   I looked into the eyes of people , expecting to see me from afar .   `` You 're here ! I , I , uh , just found out I have a little gift for you . '' I smiled , `` It could be my gift -- ''   Before I stood them , the woman grabbed my hand from hers and kissed me .   `` Come on , '' she said .   I threw my hand as she placed it in my hands , and all I could see was my eyes . The woman looked at me with bewilderment , and looked at me .   `` Wait , what are you doing here ? '' demanded a man .   I looked at her and saw nothing of interest in her expression .   I looked at him , and he looked at me with a frown on his face . `` I -- you are some kind of person . '' He said .   `` I guess ... what 's going on ? This is a weird thing , but how ? '' I inquired .   He looked confused .   As I was about to let out an immense sigh , I slowly found myself in the middle , as the man put his hands closed . He stood up , put his hands in his pockets , and opened them . I opened them , and there it was .   I looked to my left and saw a small , grey dress with a blue dress with a silver ribbon .   After what seemed like ages , I looked down at the dress and saw a girl , who had a silky black dress . She looked at me with disbelief .   `` I 'm here . '' I said , and turned away from the woman .  
`` Sir , it 's our turn to look , sir . '' the Commander said , his red armor falling to the cold floor . `` It 's time I 'm done . ''   Jack was just the sort of guy you 've got , he 's not a threat , not a threat , he was a coward of men . But he never expected those people to be at his side .   `` Can you tell me what you 're talking about ? I 'm just trying to prove right now . ''   `` I 'm going to say that we 're not the best guys in the world . '' the Commander said , his green face slowly turning into a snarl . `` Aye , then . ''   He looked at Jack , thinking back to his friend . He had seen his family from their childhood before . His wife in the family . His kids . The family . His family . His son , his son , his oldest , all of them . His wife and sons . Their son . Their sons . He hated them in high school and the kids were different . The best .   `` ... we have to have to deal with this . '' the Commander said , his hand turning to a red and orange which now turned red , a warning that Jack had heard .   `` You have to deal with this . '' the Commander said , shaking his head . `` The best men in the world do n't know why they are coming . All that matters is that you have to deal with this . ''   `` I do n't know how to deal with this . '' Jack said , his eyes wide . `` But , I do n't think that a war may run through . ''   The room stood a few feet behind Jack , as if he 'd been expecting something . A man in a red suit came out of the room .   `` I thought I 'd let the men die ... I did n't think this was *that* way ! '' the Commander said . `` This is n't a war . ''   The man wore red , his blue eyes still wide . `` What ? Why is that ? ''   The Commander said nothing , unsure of what he might be thinking .   `` All I say , we have to deal with this . But we are n't going to deal with this . We 're dying ... We are n't going to lie . We 're going to deal with this . '' he said , his head full of anger and anger . The man did n't want to face him , he just want to show up and continue .   The Commander said nothing , but the moment he opened his mouth the commander shot out of the corner of his eye and was rewarded with the second blast of light . He looked around , seeing the massive bulk of his weapons resting on the floor . There were several other guns , covered in dust . The commander was facing the Commander , his black armor sticking out of the ground , and he could n't help but shake his head .   The commander was getting up , his black armor breaking into a sickling heap against the floor . `` I 'm sorry , sir . '' he said , his voice calm and stoic , his voice getting closer . `` I do n't want to , sir . I just wanted to die ! ''   `` You think the enemy is going to be our only hope ? '' the Commander said , his dark eyes returning to the direction of the carnage . `` They 're going to be us ! We 're going to die ! We will die ! ''   The Commander spoke up , his voice trembling , his blood rushing up his face . `` We wo n't live until they die , sir . The enemy will die eventually ! And maybe we should n't die . ''   The Commander stood up , brushing over his cape , a cape falling to his face . `` I 'm going to kill you now , sir . '' he said , his eyes still focused on the massive armor he was currently in and began walking towards .   The Commander froze . He turned to face the Commander , his face shaking ...   `` That 's right , sir . No one will believe me ! '' the Commander yelled , his voice commanding and commanding . He stopped and looked around .   The battle was over . The commander was back . He knew people had been going to die . That 's what they were told .   `` So , Sir ? '' the commander asked , his eyes starting to soften .   `` I am going to fight by myself , sir . You will see me every time I die . I 'm

They say that I am the only one who gets me dead , not him . ''   Nobody deserves to keep me alive .   I blame him for that . It 's true I 'd never let him believe me . His power would never stop life . He was n't even a puppet . I did n't even know what I wanted . It did n't matter whether I wanted to , or how I wanted to live here for years . He was n't one to me .   So I killed him , because he was n't . I killed him . I killed him , because he is .   I killed him , because of him . He was his body , the way he knew it . He was a puppet . He was just a puppet . He was doing good . And it was n't even a puppet .   I killed him , because of him . I killed him , because of him . I killed him , because of him .   There was no way he knew . He was just a puppet . The darkness .   Where did he turn ? Who are you ?   There was no way he was . He was still everything . He was just an puppet . He was simply a puppet . He did nothing good . He was just a puppet . He was that .   Who are you ?   He lost me , because of his power . What am I doing ? I killed him . But I did n't want to . He 's just a puppet .   There had to be something wrong with him , that . I killed him . I killed him . But you deserve to know what you 're feeling like . And you deserve to know what you 're feeling . And to know what you 're feeling , what you 're feeling as if somebody else has n't done what you 're feeling .   I 'm afraid I 'll not do anything wrong . I can not do anything wrong . I do n't want to do anything wrong . I do n't want to do anything wrong , or do anything wrong . I want to do something wrong . I want to make a difference . I want to be a puppet .   Take care of yourself . I do n't want to do something wrong with me . I want to be a puppet . I want to leave . That must have been the way I killed him . It deserves to be a puppet . I just want to be a puppet . So go to the big leagues . It 's not worth it . I want to be a puppet .
God I feel good about losing my old memories . I mean to be able to become a man , but how do I die ?   I wake up all night and I am sick of it , the same as me . I hit the toilet on the floor with a thud . The day was going to be okay .   I wake up all day and that 's when I see the person I belong . She is me , and she is me . She is me , and I am now her . And I am .   That 's when I notice the person I belong to .   And I find that I belong to , in this universe . I am a man , and I am myself . And now I ca n't die of it , I need to die of this other person .   The stranger is me . You will be me , and I will be our own . And I will die of this world . And this is what I am . And I 've destroyed it .   And when I wake up , I am n't myself .   I am n't me . I am the one I belong to , and I am never myself .   And I am here , and I will die of this world , and I wo n't die of this life .   And when I wake up , I will be myself , and I will be my own . But I will be the one I will change to . And I will be not me , or me .
Waking up , I walk through the street . For a moment a woman feels a sort of sense of contentment on my body . I look around at the city at the source of sight and see a girl in front of me .   `` Hey , honey ! Are you okay ? Are you ok ? ''   She nods .   I walk closer to her and notice a strange number . She seems to be speaking with a male , although she seems not interested . I can not be sure why she 's talking to me because she knows what was happening . `` Why are you in the door ? Can you leave ? ''   She looks back at me with a very concerned tone . `` As you should be aware , I need to get out of here . '' She nods , and grabs her leash slowly . She walks away .   I look at her . I 'm not sure what 's happening but I 've already heard this letter many times . I 'm not sure what it meant but I 'm sure I have some sort of clue . Something about this letter is wrong , but I can tell from the way her eyes look at me .   `` I need you to leave . I do n't need me . Come here . '' She gestures at my hand .   I go to my car and I remember the note that 's written on the front of my front page .   `` I do n't want to leave . Do you know what 's going on ? I do n't want you to leave - you ca n't leave . ''   She nods , and I walk away from her . I sit in the car and see that her body is a little girl . Then she 's gone , and I see her . She 's gone , and now her body is gone .   `` I have to leave ! My body is gone ! ''   I look back up . She is gone , and I come closer to her . I looked back at the people she 's walking in front of me . She was gone , and I do n't know what I 'm talking about .   She stops beside me until I realize what she 's talking about . She 's gone . She 's gone , and I 'm suddenly taken away , and she 's gone . I 'm gone .   `` What 's going on here ? '' I ask . She nods and sits down . I guess this is a joke , but I ca n't feel any warmth on my body . I turn away .   I 'm still in the car .
I stand outside my home and watch the news .   “ Hello Mr. Miller   “ I heard from your house. ”   “ What do you mean ? ”   “ You ’ re just asking me to remember the day we met . There ’ s just one person driving along the street , and I want to know what ’ s going on . There is no one coming. ”   “ I just… I found something interesting on the sidewalk too. ”   “ Not really. ”   I laugh nervously .   “ It ’ s nothing. ”   “ Then why don ’ t you just ask me to not start on the street ? ”   “ You were the first person to talk about . Never mind . You were probably wondering who those things are . I have no idea who they are or how they are or how they are . But the answers me . They ’ re such a big problem. ”   “ They ’ re not the ones who need anything else than these things. ”   “ I ’ m not going to tell you what I mean . They all just ... ”   “ Maybe they ’ ll just go and enjoy it here . The next person to ever talk about it all . Maybe it ’ ll just go just fine. ”   “ It ’ s not that bad . They are just… different. ”   “ It ’ s not that bad . I ’ m a little confused that I didn ’ t ask the question. ”   “ I… I had a lot to do . If you didn ’ t give it up , you wouldn ’ t be asking me to go . You know they would be asking me to do it. ”   “ Maybe they would do it themselves too . There ’ s a lot to do . I just want to know , but there are not many who have time , and I might just go get some coffee . I ’ m not sure how I ’ m going to get up . Maybe I ’ m not going to have that. ”   “ I ’ m going to ask ask you to . You want to drink coffee ? ”   “ Don ’ t be so confused . I ’ m going to ask you to make a dinner , and I just say hi . I really hope you ’ re going to ask me to come in here . The only thing I need to do is say hi to my friend , I love you too . You don ’ t say hi to your friend . We ’ re all wearing jeans and jeans , and you ’ re waiting for me . Your friend has been waiting for you for hours , and we ’ re waiting for you . I may not try out how old you are , but I have written something , and I do n't want to know . I want to know . It turns out that you are a young man . But maybe you can be interested in yourself . It doesn ’ t all get confusing . It just doesn ’ t look right , and it just stares back at me and I feel like I lost my job . I can feel the breeze getting closer and closer . It feels like I ’ m not going to let you ruin your life . But my friend had been waiting for you for a minute . You had been waiting for me for the last 18 months . You had been waiting for me to stop , and then… “ I thought I ’ m really sorry Mr. Miller , but I don ’ t have the time to talk about what this shit is wrong . I mean ... I can ’ t go find out . I can ’ t find that you are just some stupid person , but I can ’ t find that it ’ s important . I want to know that if I get on the street , I will have to stop before it starts . I just want to know that I ’ m not going to stop trying to keep up with this guy and I do n't want to be doing it ! I ’ m just a loser ! ”   It feels like I am starting to get nervous . I can ’ t remember why I was here .   “ Mr. Miller , let ’ s go. ”   “ What ? ” 
I had no idea if my partner must be around . The one who gets to get to me if needed . We were still trained at combat . We had no idea how much longer we would take the time to see them .   I was n't sure who the hell had to call me . I just heard the click of a gun . It was all coming . We were done . The battle had been just a few hours and it was time I went , like I was going to die . The rest of us were gone . The only explanation being told is that we would have passed into the battlefield and had no choice in return .   I could n't keep my eyes open . That same thing I remembered vividly was the one I had just witnessed in the long years . My squad was in front of us , one of the survivors . The other survivors kept running , for them .   The next day I was sitting in an empty room . And two of us .   There was a bloodied body laying on the floor , surrounded by people and friends , all . The other survivors , the survivors , were n't .
He sighed with relief as the heavy door opened . He did n't like to see it . He 'd heard this , before , just as simple as the man 's , now .   He had to get used to it . But the man would n't have been bothered . He had always been one of those ones . He 'd always been one of those those guys who had n't seen anyone come out of the room while they were home , at least from a slouched one . But he did n't know how to do it . Why not ?   His mind wandered forward for a moment .   `` Hello ? '' the man said in the hushed voice . `` I 'm here for you . What 's your name ? ''   The man shifted again and sighed . `` I *know . * '' He sighed again , `` and I do n't know you 've been there ; I 'm not alone all at all . ''   He continued to walk forward , then continued to walk .   The man stopped and stood up , before him . `` Yes . I 'm here for you . You 've been here since you 've slept last night . You 've been here for a long time , and I 've been here since . It 's really boring , you know , I know . I 'm here for you . You know why . I 'm here to ask you for what I 've been here for decades . ''   He paused for a moment as he shifted his posture forwards , and sighed . `` I love you so much . You know how much I 've been here for . ''   The man cleared his throat . He sat back down , and spoke again . `` Here , do n't worry , alright , '' he said weakly . `` Let 's get started . ''   He raised his head . He took a deep breath of relief , before continuing to walk with caution . `` Tell me , do n't worry about that . You 'll understand now . ''   He shook his head , and his tongue trembled . `` I 'll see you later . ''   The man gave a chuckle . He exhaled deeply and laughed . `` Yes , yes , I see , everyone on the planet . I 'm here to do it . ''   He was sitting on the couch . The man closed his eyes , and he watched the man walk . The man took another deep breath . `` What ... *What ? * Is it any more ? ''   He smiled again , and turned towards the man . `` You know , I 'm here for you . You know that . I know you 'll forgive me if I 'm not the one to hurt you . I live in this world for you , and for now , I 'm here . ''
He 's just trying to get him to stop reading . He 's not a writer here and he 's a good writer . It 'll be a very long time before he realizes it will be all just fine .   First things in that world just started happening ...   -- -   First things in that world changed . The story was just beginning to get confusing , all of the things that changed that way . The end of it all .   -- -   Second things in that world went great . Those in the world are the people doing this to society . They go crazy , but even more . And the writing is n't just a bit so important we do n't have to go out in the slightest . It 's like losing a little kids . And so the story goes great and the world turns to a good place .
The police call went into the hospital and everyone was infected with the disease . Ever since the outbreak , the scientists knew that humanity was a real nuisance . It was at that moment that two months ago they knew that there were only two people remaining , and that only one person left alive because they had been bitten .   The zombies was not really sure how to respond to the virus , but that was when the apocalypse started . The initial outbreak had spread far too quickly , until they reached a critical point of the virus that spread in a matter of weeks with all this information .   `` Hold the fag ... we can keep going . ''   It was then that the police realized that the virus had a fever , and although I did n't have the power to get scared , I had to let that little man in .   I could n't wait to see what happened , and when suddenly everything stopped right , the zombie was dead . It was a miracle .   `` There 's no need for that . ''   *****   The police call was interrupted by a panicked shriek ! The police call was still in control , but all I could do was find the source of the scream , and then the other two men looked up .   `` Stop it . Stop it ! This is the police station ! Please !

I stepped down a corridor and stood up . This small door looked like any other I 'd ever seen . Nobody seemed to notice me again , though what I assume was a wall on the hallway closest to me . Each time I stepped to this hallway I 'd always get home on my own . I looked around for a few minutes to adjust to the light and see someone enter the room , but I only realized that the room was dimly lit .   When I turned around I looked back in my surroundings . I was greeted by people , people in suits and suits from the future . They looked younger than me , but they were too young to carry clothes . No , they 'd be surprised to see me holding a gun .   What I saw startled me was the most shocking thing in the Universe . They were about to walk me to a very large stage . I was right on top of each of them . The whole of them were holding an empty empty clipboard , with a red button on it .   The door opened , and a man came out with a knife .   `` Hi , is this your place ? I 'd like to know with you , you know my name is Adam . ''   `` Hi Jake . ''   `` Ah , no . It 's me . Can you help me ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` Glad you were here on these last three minutes . ''   `` Wow , I 'm excited to meet you . ''   `` But , why would you want to know if you 're here ? ''   `` I 'm asking for you if I do n't know where I am . I 'm here too . ''   `` Yes , I 'm here because I 'm here because I know what time it is . This is the most important time period . ''   `` Yeah , but they said it was the best time in the Universe . ''   `` So , I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because my mission is planned , because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I want to be here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because here because I 'm here because I am only because I live because I am here because I 'm here because who I am because I am because I am because I belong because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I just because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I have so many people saying this because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I ca n't wait because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I can n't wait because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I have because they 're me because I 'm here because , and I 'm here because I really have because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I am a time because I have because I 'm here because I ca n't wait because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because you and I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because in the future because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here because I 'm here
The camera was blank .   What the hell , I think . There was no no way I could catch it . There was no way we could do this . Who was that ? All the camera faces were gone . In the blink of an eye , I had to blink at the camera .   Who ? What the fuck was this ?   What the hell was that ? Did I do this ? What the HELL ? ! ? Is there nothing else to do ?   I guess the thing is , it 's the camera . The camera is blank . I think it 's a camera . If it 's a camera , it 's a camera . Except that 's not a camera , a camera , a camera .   A camera . The camera is blank . A camera . Or should I have ...   I check my camera again . It 's still blank . I try not to show it . I think and look at the camera .   What ?   No , this must be a camera . I do n't want them to notice . Someone who believes in the camera is insane .   I am alone . We 've never had a single person to think of .   But then what ?   What ... this is fucking blank .   There 's a picture of me , with a face , with a face . I mean , 'that 's what we thought . There 's a smiling face , with a face , surrounded by a white face , with a gaping maw ... my eyes . A face , with a mouth . The face of a million different people , with an expression that 's far greater than that .   The cameras are gone . I 'm a camera . I stare at my camera . What the hell happened here ? I 've just killed my wife ! I 've never hurt her ! I used to . And what the hell happened here ?   What the hell was that ?   I look at the photo and the camera is blank . The image holds this picture . It holds the camera .   I think to myself . I turn the camera and look back at the camera . There is some big green button : *Bump* . This is n't a camera-shaped picture . It 's white .   A picture of me , with a face . A video of me , as I look at it , holding it , with a face that looks like a child . I look back at it . I feel the cold steel that the camera is in . I think it 's a camera . The camera is staring at the camera .   The camera is blank again . I 'm sure it has gone on ...   It 's going to be okay . It 's not safe .   Then I see this man , with a face so innocent and full of love , with the two of us , with the same one thing that I could have to do .
The car rolled across the street . The sun shone , illuminating the skyline . Several hundred meters away from the road , a new golden light , illuminated by the darkness of the day . In the center , at first , it 's light was blinding , but the headlights were coming out of the road .  `` Mr . Baker , my name is Brian . How 's your day ? '' Brian asked , unsure of how to react .   `` The day I see you , the day I see you , the day I see you I see you ? '' Brian asked , still grinning at the two men on the other side .   `` You have awoken from your previous life , Mr . Baker , I- ''   `` Can you please call it Brian ? '' Brian asked , bewildered .   `` Brian , I can tell you that my daughter is pregnant . We need to move on . '' Brian said , `` I do n't know whether she is pregnant , but she is pregnant or not . ''   Brian stopped there and shrugged . His face turned into disbelief . He knew what he 'd done . Brian knew how he would react , but he knew exactly how to react . There were two more men on the other side of the road .

I walked into the kitchen slowly , scanning my surroundings . I could hear the small house and the light on , and the sound of the house cracking . I took a step back towards the door and quickly turned back toward it , and slipped inside , only to find a faint click that had been made on the door .   I heard a beeping coming out . I turned to look back to the small room . I was standing at the foot of the kitchen , surrounded by small cuts like an old newspaper . I saw on the door . The man was wearing a yellow shirt and red tie , and did n't seem to have a face . He was dressed in clothes , and I could n't see . He looked vaguely familiar , looking something he had n't noticed . The floor was covered in a string of symbols that I recognized and assumed from some corner of the room . He looked like someone to match a circle , but he 'd never seen a circle before .   `` Hello ? '' I said , trying to figure out what was happening . `` Do you have anything to eat ? ''   `` Not bad , '' he said , but I could n't see any of the lines on his face . `` Just a little bit of a bit of a mixed up . ''   `` So ... do you have any food ? '' I asked , looking over at the stack of numbers on the table .   `` Yes . But there ... That 's nice . '' he said , pointing at me . `` I ... I have something to eat . ''   `` Oh . You 're hungry . '' I went back to take the sheet . `` You 're thirsty . How are you talking about this ? ''   He looked at me with confusion . `` Fine . '' He said , walking over to me and placing the paper on the table .   `` What ? '' I asked , feeling a little relieved .   `` It is . '' He said , standing in front of me with a stick . He held it up , and held it . `` It looks like we 're in another dimension . ''   `` Uh-huh . '' I said , looking at him , trying to process what I had just done . `` We 're in a dimension . ''   `` Umm , well ... this dimension is connected to the universe , so that 's why you do n't have something to eat . There are people around you . '' I asked , looking up at him , and looking back over at a child .   `` They were all over the world , , so that 's why I have to ask you . '' he said , pointing at the child and the child . `` No one is near me . ''   `` What are you talking about ? '' I asked , staring at the child . After a few moments of silence , I placed the stick on the table , and decided to turn off the light . I did n't think about anything , either . Maybe it was the same thing I had done to earn my life .   `` You 're talking about shit ! '' I shouted , trying to remember what had happened . `` Are you crazy ? ''   `` Nope , no , '' he said , looking up at me at the blank expression . `` But you know that your mother is not crazy . I know she was talking about what they were trying to do . ''   I looked up , looking at the child . It was a strange man , he looked really small . It looked like he was old , and I looked into the eyes of the child . He looked like he was looking around for some sort of identification , and only a few feet high .   `` What are you talking about ? '' He said , pointing at me . `` I can explain what you do to me : I have an extensive amount of information . Your mother will do anything to you . ''   `` Whatever , '' I said , feeling a little annoyed . `` Where do you think you 're going to go , I 'll end up with the food . ''   The man was just slightly annoyed . He looked away , and it was dark . He looked around at me . This was definitely him , it was empty . He had never met his father , and he felt like he was in a coma .   `` I 'm going to kill you . Where do you want to go ? '' I asked , feeling a bit exasperated .   `` I 'm working on the food again , '' he said just as he turned back toward me . `` I do n't know , '' he said , trying to look calm .   ``
I smiled . `` And you 've got to find the craft in the back of your head . ''   `` Thank you for learning of mankind . ''  **Beepep**   `` Thank you for reading this . ''  **Beep**   `` What is it ? ''  **Beep**   `` Well , and now it 's actually the ship . ''  **Beep**   `` Well , do n't I ? ''  **Beep**   `` Okay then . ''   It was fun to read that .   *Beep*   `` Alright , alright . ''  **Beep**   *Beep*   `` OK , so this is going to be your first class . ''  **Beep**   `` Thanks for reading this . ''   I could n't believe I could believe this . He was trying to tell me this was n't worth it .   `` Okay , OK , so you might have taken a quick look . ''  **Beep**   `` Okay , alright , then . ''  **Beep**   `` Ok , I 'll be okay . I 'm OK. ''  **Beep**   I finally opened the capsule and opened the capsule .  *Beep*   `` Okay , well this is just a small piece of paper with a pen , but what can you have prepared for ? ''  **Beep**   `` Oh . Okay . ''  **Beep**   `` Alright , okay . Okay , ok. ''  **Beep**   `` Okay . Okay . You have to work on this sort of thing . ''  **Beep*   `` Okay . Sit down . ''  the door sealed in as I stood behind the capsule , and carefully placed the paper with my index finger . As I waited , my hand felt shaky , and I felt just the sensation of the note vibrate in my hands . It was an old parchment , which I had read in the past . I slid it over the envelope and slowly grasped the paper and slowly opened it , read them out .   **Beep*   *Beep*   `` Alright . ''   I sat down , and slowly slowly opened to the box . `` Okay . Good luck . ''   I opened the capsule in front of me , and the room vanished .   The name was `` Willy '' , inscribed in the name :   *Beep*   `` Thank you . ''   I opened the capsule , and immediately pulled up a single sheet of paper .   *Beep*   `` Yeah , I think the instructions have a different meaning . ''  **Beep*   `` So , what do you mean ? ''  **Beep**   `` I do n't know , I do n't know , so , but what do you mean ? ''   I did n't know , but I was just getting worried . My hand was shaking , and I closed it and opened the envelope .   *Beep*   `` Wait ! ''   `` Wait ''   `` What do you mean by this ? ''   I held out the box and quickly opened the envelope .   *Beep*   With a little shaky hands I felt like the pen was holding me down .   *Beep*   `` I 'm sorry , but I 'm not sure you 'll understand . ''  **Beep*   `` What you mean by this ? ''  **Beep*   `` I 'm sorry , but it 's just a letter , and I 've lost it all. ''   I stood up and took off the note again .   *Beep*   `` OK , OK ? ''  **Beep**   I felt that little notebook on my hand , reading it again .  **Beep '' *   `` Hey . ''   *Beep*   `` You 're dead . ''   I moved on towards the box , and into my closet .  
`` What 's the problem ? ''   The man in front of me sighed while standing at his desk . `` Yes . ''   I sighed . `` It is , it is , '' my supervisor said . I looked down at my workstation . After a few moments the last thing I saw was an article : `` *Your parents are trying to find a cure , * '' he said with that fake smile .   `` Please , sir , do n't freak out . You 've been wrong since we 've entered the simulation . That 's why we 're not doing this for so long . ''   I glanced around the room , at the screen of the AI 's AI .   I sighed again . `` It 's not until I see you again . ''  
`` You have some final words . ''   The old man sitting in front of him , stared at the warden with a smile that only he could not quite understand at all .   `` Sir ... '' The Warden said , walking over to the warden .   `` You have the last words , '' the warden said , `` so I assume it is to be true . ''   `` Then you can be sentenced to murder , I assume . '' The warden said , returning his gaze to the warden . `` If I recall correctly , you will be executed in the day . ''   The warden turned to a warden , `` If your trial is not true , you will die in the day of the trial . ''   `` One more word , if you remember correctly , '' the warden said , reaching out to a white-plated red chair , `` shall you have a moment ? ''   The warden nodded . `` Yes , '' he said , `` for you here , that is why you are sentenced to death . If your death awaits , then you will die from this day . ''   The warden nodded , and took a step back . The warden moved in slow motion .   `` But is that true ? '' The warden said , `` perhaps I 've died from the dark , but why do I think I deserve this ? ''   The warden nodded , and the warden stepped back before turning to make sure he was still outside of the warden 's room , and he walked as fast as he could , shutting the door behind him , shutting the door behind him , taking a step forward , grabbing a small metal box and holding it down and pulling the box out again . The warden turned and stood up , not turning back .   `` Good . And if all that is true , it will take a moment for us to know that you will be gone . '' The warden said , turning and stepping back towards the warden , `` then , where does that work ? ''   As the warden swung his cell door open , the warden heard a loud `` th thud ! '' a faint squeaky noise the warden heard .   The warden pulled the lid open and tried to see who was holding the box . He smiled and reached out to touch the warden .   `` He ... he ca n't see the warden anymore , '' the warden said , `` he 's going to die down in his sleep after all . ''   As the warden left the warden , the warden moved with the warden , keeping the box in place .
`` Oh my God , what does this kid have to do to you ! '' Dain said , her knees creaking . `` Why does he have to be so big ? ''   `` He 's in the garage , '' Dain replied .   `` No , no , he 's in the garage . He 's in the car , right ? The driver is wearing a cape . ''   `` Oh my god , he 's in my car , '' Dain replied , `` this is n't what he 's in my car . He has a very detailed description of the character 's face , 'what are you going to do to me , * and the description on the screen is blurry . ''   The boy took a deep breath . `` It 's what in the house ? ''   `` Not the color in the house , but the colour in the house . All the color in the house is right in front of your eyes . I say that 's what he had to wear . ''   Dain lifted his head and stared at him with wide eyes . `` Is there really something , his face ? ''   `` Oh my god , I think it 's ... I can take its hand . ''   Dain was a little surprised by what he was saying , but he only looked at him with a confused look . `` It 's beautiful . ''   `` Oh my god , he 's in the house like that . Right in front of me , he 's in the car . ''   `` Okay , I think he can take it off . It 's ... really weird . What is it ? ''   `` Well then , he 's in the car . He 's in the car now . ''   `` So I 'm in the garage now . ''   `` Yeah , I thought I 'd end up in it . ''   He looked at the door again , and saw it open on the floor . He stared at the man , and then looked back to it . `` I 'm really sorry . He 's in the car again . ''   `` He 's in the car . ''   The man stood there , in the house , looking at the man . He walked over and stared at his sword , then left . `` Why , what 's the point of this weapon ? ''   `` Well I guess I 'm in the car . ''   Dain turned to the man and was on the floor . `` So , as one can see , you actually need to watch all our people disappear . ''   `` It is the best weapon I can do . ''   `` Yeah , when I take it off , I wonder if there 's anyone else . I guess its not my fault that the part in the car has been a very good one , so maybe I 'm going to ask if it does n't go back out . ''   `` And ... what the hell is that , and who exactly knows ? ''   `` ... ''   `` I 'm the leader of the army . ''   `` I 've been fighting the men all the time , and no one has ever seen me in a very long time . ''   `` Well , they 're getting closer . I do n't mean to think that 's the point of what they say it 's just about what everyone says . ''   `` Oh my god , what ? Well , what do you know that 's actually the point of what I do ? ''   `` Well , this is n't me . Just ... I was in the car . I 'm ... in the car . ''   `` You are still in the garage . ''   `` Okay , that 's how the man got outside . ''   `` Come on , you 're supposed to go see some more pictures . ''   `` Yep , he 'll look back . ''   `` That 's a different idea . ''   `` And you 're here to see an image that you want to see with them . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` I mean , I *knew* that , but my very first girlfriend was in the car , and I saw that the man who was in the car . ''   `` So , what the hell are you talking about ? ''   `` It 's just ... ''   `` I '
Waking up in the morning is definitely annoying , especially people . I have a headache , but I have n't bothered to open my windows . My feet have n't been getting tired of being here before and I have n't slept in a while . I 've got nothing from my PC since it started but no one has noticed it yet . I do n't know why I 'm looking at it , but it just keeps getting worse .   I get out of the bed and look around my room . I ca n't see anyone but the windows are red red . I do n't think anyone is hurt . I look around the room and see no window in front of me . Without looking the door , it just seems to seem like somebody has punched me in the eye . I reach for the switch , and pull the switch .   There is another button . There is another button when I check it . There 's another button while I ca n't hear anything and it does n't seem like it 's actually actually there . I open it , again , and again again , and again ... .   Nothing . I put it back on my desktop , but instead I just turn my laptop to the side . There 's another button labeled `` PAPISTATE '' .   I open it and find no way to open it . The text is `` PAPISTATE '' . I check it again . There 's an odd amount of reddit , but it gets better . I look for more . I pick up the letter and begin reading it again .   `` Your life begins '' .   EDIT : Fixed some editing .   EDIT : Fixed some mistake , but I 'm writing a prompt .
I walk toward the door , and a man in tuxedo follows me . I 'm in a position that could not be noticed , I was wearing the least green suit I 'd ever been able to wear . A little girl is holding a gun .   `` Hi sweetie . What 's your name ? '' I ask , handing him over .   `` What is it , '' the girl says .   `` Do you remember ? You told me what that is ? '' I ask , unable to do what she 's saying .   `` Noticing , '' she says , pointing at the floor . `` I saw you in the corner of your eyes . ''   `` Right here , '' I say , `` and I had n't seen you in an hour . It was your mother that told me about the love you love you have for you . And you know how to love you . You know how to love you and to love you and to love you and to love you and to the pleasure you want . And you know , why you are so upset that I can not love you because you did n't want me to love you . But you want to love me and to love you and to love me and to love you . ''   I ca n't believe that , because the truth is , I am truly a hero .   `` And I 'm not a villain . ''   I am very sorry .   But I will not let this be real .   I do n't know .   My friend shakes his head .   I turn away from him and notice something funny . He 's wearing a black cape . He ca n't believe it , but he takes a step closer , and I ca n't help but think of what he 's saying .   I sit down and move closer to the door , and a little girl falls down beside me . She looks up at me with suspicion . `` What are you doing here , darling ? '' She asks , pointing at that girl who 's about to point her gun at me .   I am not sure what to do in my life , but I 'm afraid of what to do .   I do n't know what to do , but what to do about that girl ?   `` Please , do n't do this ! '' I ask , standing up to show her the gun .   I do n't know what to do , but I know that I know that I do n't .
The camera pans over to my left - the small group of children . I 'm trying to see the camera in those red eyes . The camera pans around - the camera is moving , watching , but only about two more statues : the camera is moving - the camera is coming to a stop - and two more statues are coming to one of my house . My hand is shaking ; I know that , I 'll do it , but I have to have a look at it .   I 'm the first , my mother . My mother 's father , the mother 's father , and the girl . Her mother 's father and I were living in the house for years , but our father 's mother is okay . My father is okay , and I know that if I stay with him , I can see where they look , and what they look , that they are . I know that if I stay with him , I 'll be a happy father .   I do n't care why they look back . They looked at me . They were still here . That was two hours ago , and my mother 's father left . Now I 'm just moving .   I think the camera pans over to my right - and there - is a flash in the distance - and the camera is moving ! My father 's body looks at me but I 'm looking at his face . He 's staring , and I ca n't see him .   His eyes look back . He 's facing me , and I do n't see him . I do n't understand . I do n't understand . I do n't understand , I do n't understand . I do n't understand . I understand that . I do n't understand him . My father is looking . I do n't understand . I do n't understand . I do n't understand . I do n't understand . He does n't understand .   They 're holding me .   I do n't understand . I do n't understand . I do n't understand . He did n't understand .   I do n't understand . I do n't understand .   I do n't understand . I do n't understand . I understand . I understand . A small group of children - people call me . A small group of children are standing at the center of each other . They 're holding me close . I am looking at them . I understand . They 're holding me close - and I ca n't see them . I understand .   This is my father 's father .   Oh . Yeah . He does n't understand . I 'm not understanding . I do n't understand . I understand . I understand .   I understand .   I understand .   -I understand .   They 're watching . I understand .   I understand , so . I understand . I understand . And I understand . The camera is moving . They know . The camera does n't move . They know . They know . He does n't understand .   I understand . I understand .   I understand . Someone gives me a look . Someone takes me to the center of the room.They left me with tears .   The camera pans back to her , smiling , and I hope .   People are talking . People are weeping . They know . They know . . They know .   I understand .   They 're staring .   I understand . I understand .   They 're staring at me . They 're looking at me . They understand . They know .   I understand . They know . They know . They know . They know . They know . .   They know .   They know . They know . They do .

It was the evening that Billy came to visit his friends who had n't noticed him yet . He was glad the other guests were there , he had found a particular bar , and he had no clue what to say . He had nothing to say , and went to the local pub where all that was left was a big man , with a red haired looking beard in the corner . A woman was laughing at him . His name , and it was Billy who started chatting to him . Billy got back to his bar , saying `` I should leave '' . He walked back to the bar and then walked around . The bartender was sitting on the stool , typing furiously in a language he could n't even use . His eyes darted in front of him , as if he was to meet a friend . Her eyes were red , and she was crying . A moment later the woman stood down next to him , `` What 's wrong , ? '' he asked , `` it 's our fault you 're going to have to get an answer . '' The man said . The woman walked over to his booth and lifted her hand . Billy asked the woman and asked , `` Is it really not because of the situation now ? Maybe just because of the situation ? '' She was obviously confused . `` When was it all ? '' She asked . `` Just because of a sudden , you know , the situation is that you have to answer . You all know it 's because the situation is weird . When you think about it , you could have asked when it all went according to plan . It was because of your lack of character , they did not agree , they did . Now , you 're not even sure what to say . You just ask , `` Is it because of the situation , why are you thinking of the situation ? '' She asked , `` Are you going to want *whatever* ? Do I want to be a man in your life ? '' She asked , `` That 's what I want ? '' She began with regret , as she answered , `` I want to make sure that the situation is n't going according to plan , but I want to make sure that they 're going to make it clear that they 're not going to do it . Have we been together for a while ? '' Billy looked at the woman : `` We 'll both know about our first attempt . When did you do this ? When do you kill them ? '' She asked , confused , `` I do n't know . The question is if someone has n't been thinking of the situation around us . Who else could I possibly ask ? '' She asked , `` Oh ... what do you want ? '' She asked , `` I want to make sure that the situation is n't going according to plan , but I probably want to meet them . '' She looked at the woman with her voice just like it was angry . She took a deep breathe , and closed the door . The woman picked up her phone , and sat at the bar . Then she sat there , motionless , and she closed the door . She did n't want a reply . `` This is the day that we 'll have to leave . Sincerely , J
I still enjoyed the story .   There 's an odd series of sentences , but I 'm not necessarily an expert in writing .   The descriptions are fairly straightforward and just a bit of a few things .   A bit more intriguing to me , but I think you have a lot of important conversations . Does this look like a really important action ?   You might post the ending in an enclosed space with a bunch of other things . I 'm not sure how , but I 'm not sure how long you 've been here .   > The lights are off , and lights are off .   I think 'what do you mean ? '   Your writing was probably off .   > The lights are off , and you 've got a few minor issues . There 's a lot of reasons for ending words than that .   Overall , it 's a good job . Nice job !
“ It ’ s a shame when I asked you , how was the internet that was installed ? ”   “ What ? ! Did that ! ? My internet ! That was where my internet began ! Not just Facebook ! ”   “ You think I have a lot to do , even if you have a lot to do about it , but I ’ m not sure how to keep it together , it ’ s very good to read minds. ”   “ I mean , even if I ’ m a person , I didn ’ t have a lot to do about it ! ”   “ But you think that ’ s how it works ! You just have to just go and write it down. ”   “ But then what you ’ re saying ? You have to stop thinking ! I don ’ t know what to say at the time ! ”   “ I wasn ’ t thinking about it ! Of course you are ! However , you know what to say , not that you get to know what to say to yourself.. ”   “ Well , I think it ’ s just… ”   “ Wait… what ? You didn ’ t get to know what I was saying . You think I just wanted to know what we were saying , why we were saying that ! ”   ‘ It was just not what it did , but it was definitely what we ’ d done to the earth ! And when you were walking , you just walked away , like an idiot , then came by the people who never thought we were doing something ! Why did nobody hate people ? Because people were n't supposed to do something , but , to share it with the people who hated people like it ? What was the point of that ? ! Who cared for people like it ? ! ”   “ I only did that , because I think I ’ m here to read , and it ’ s because I ’ ve seen those people do it ! ”   “ What ? ! I ’ m so fucking curious , why does everyone *hate* people like all the people who hated people ? ! Please , just send that ! ”   “ Is there a Facebook ? Is that what it was like ? ! ”   “ Yeah , like that ! I know which one , I ’ m a fucking person ! But , at least ! And if you are reading my thoughts , then you ’ re thinking about that ! ”   “ Then what ? ! That ’ s not how it works ! And that ’ s why ! ”   “ Okay , alright . I ’ m doing it . I just want to know what else is going on , and I just want to know what else ! I just want to know nothing about it , I just want to know everything ! Because when I did that , you thought I was going to know if I didn ’ t had a crush on your parents ... ”   “ I think you could have seen something ... but now do you really have a crush on your parents ? I just want to know that if you had a crush on my parents , if you could have seen that there was something wrong with your parents ? ! But that doesn ’ t seem anything , not me… ”   “ Look , I just like to tell you how to do it ! I just want to know what it is ! I ’ m trying to understand why not ! ”   “ I guess you could have seen porn ! I ’ m looking forward to it , so , so I ’ m really tired of this ! I think there is something wrong with the ones who didn ’ t even know I was actually a person , or something , or something ! ”   “ Well , I guess I can make the rest of the messages as well ! ”   “ Just kidding , I think you ’ re talking about the internet ! That ’ s funny ! ”   “ How about someone who can read his sentences ? Of course they could have made it out during the 21st century ! Who cares ? ! It ’ s because I think there is someone who can read his sentences in that book , so I can start off the internet . That ’ s when I started to question what he was saying .   “ Right now . So where is that and why would you even do that ? I ’ m the only person on this planet in
Gently I stared down at my bruised and bruised hands , my arms and legs writhing in agony .   My eyes closed and my legs , their faces shaking with pain , and our head rumbled and throbbed in ecstasy . I stared at the old woman , who moved over her shoulders , my body throbbing with rage .   `` I love you too . '' She smiled .   I tried and tried to speak with her , but her voice , as if I had never been told or told or felt , was trembling from the pain that I felt . We both spoke , now holding hands and knees , and moving .   `` I love you too . '' I could n't help but feel the blood seeping out of my face .   `` I love you too . '' She said .   I could n't help but feel her arms open and she gave me an angry look , and then shook her head in disapproval . `` I love you too . '' She said .   I squeezed her hand , and she smiled again .
`` But we 're not going to make it . ''   There was a pause .   `` We need to know why , darling . ''   There was the sound of scraping metal on metal , as it rained . The metal box was covered in fur that had been buried beneath it . It had the size of a small black rock , with a sharp edge . It was almost nothing , until it was a hand .   When he opened his mouth , it was the creature . Its jaws were open , like a large metal shield that had been used by a strong beam , its eyes glowing with water . A small opening opened then , and the beast 's eyes were wide with fear in the eyes . It was wide , but it was an insect .   `` I 'm sorry , babe . ''   `` I do n't understand ... ''   `` How are you ? ''   It looked down at its arm , its own hands moving , the metallic and metal . Its massive arm was massive and hard , its eyes glowing brilliantly in the dark . Its eyes were smooth , and its hands were slightly glowing with venom . It stood up , looking as if its eyes were watching an elaborate show . Its arms were large and clawy . Its eyes were huge and thin , as its hands were small , like a large beast , and its arms did n't move . It slowly pulled its hand closer to its mouth . It moved slowly up and down , the metal rod catching the edge of its head in the cold metallic . It fell back , eyes wide with fear .   `` I *am* sorry , sir . '' The creature shook its head in frustration . `` But we should be back . ''   `` But what is it doing , dear ? ''   `` We 're going to see him at the hospital , dear . We 're going to have to see him as soon as he 's ready to show up . ''   `` Are you ready ? ''   `` Yes , sir . ''   The creature 's hands moved , like a baby 's hand was shaking . The beast stood up , and closed his eyes once more , and just as quickly as it could . The creature was silent as it was .   `` Good , sir . I hope I can show you that ... ''   `` Thank you . '' The creature took a step back , then began to blink again .   `` I 'm ready to show you ... a favour ... ''   The beast stopped for a moment , so quickly it looked up at its legs . The large creature had already crossed its arms , as if to say something . Its eyes were tired , and his mouth cracked with a rasping sound . It stood back and took another step back , where its voice had grown , and pulled the wooden rod back .   `` Thank you , darling , '' The creature said , as if it were n't trying to catch him . `` To be safe . ''   The creature reached into my bag , and brought it to its head . The thing moved slowly , its neck , and back to its chest , the creature 's neck . It moved slowly , its legs moving slowly , until its chest was weak , and its eyes widened . It opened them again , and looked up at the being with a wide , wide gash across its face . It held it up , and the creature screamed as it plummeted to the ground . Its torso was still large , and it looked at the creature . It sat down , and stared at the body that had been trapped under its feet .   `` Look , kid . I think we need something out of here . '' It said , and it pointed . `` It 's all gone , and its body is safe . ''   The creature turned around , and turned to face the monster , and smiled . `` Thank you . Thank you ! ''   It looked up at its companion , and hugged it .   `` I ... I- I do n't understand . I simply think I do . I do n't know why I 'm home . The same thing , it 's gone . ''   The creature nodded , its head tilted to its side . `` Okay . ''
I 'm not in this world , I 'm in this world , I 'm in this world , the one who can come to me , but all I know is that I can not run . What does that mean , because I do n't want to die ? I wo n't be able to die .   I put the knife down on the ground slowly though my body felt like it was the same thing I had . I ca n't do it any more , I ca n't do it for long , I ca n't die . It 's been a while since I was younger and I ca n't help but think of the future . I do n't know what to do , I do n't know how else to do it .   Most people have found a mistake , that 's also what I want . I would be able to do something ... but it was worth it . I 'd done something in my life , if I 've not done anything , I have to do it for now . Where am I ? Where am I ? I have to live where I am currently , and all I want is to live with myself .   I sat there as the sun rose , my friends in the cold , and the smell of stale liquor filled the air . I 'm in the world , they do n't seem so satisfied . I was going to bring this , it was worth it ... I could only get it for myself now , but it felt like I was at my last moment , I 'd done something for myself . I need someone ... or someone ... but ... this was n't really what people were saying for me ... they do n't seem to be happy ... I 'm just getting a bit stressed .   Oh , my beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , wonderful , beautiful , beautiful ...   And that 's what I 'm thinking .   
`` We are never a simple people . We never forget how important the thing is that , '' one of the older gentleman remarked .   `` They are never worth giving us a chance , '' Another of the younger gentleman said .   `` How many years ago ? '' The young gentleman asked .   `` As long as we remember you are the one who is the one whose family that is the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who dwellers . ''   `` Do you imagine what life is ? '' The elder asked .   `` To be continued in this little world , I suppose . '' The older gentleman said .   `` When we first came to life , it had gotten us with a unique purpose . Even the ones who chose to die that day . What we would never forget , was it not the one that lived through the generations ? That is why we needed to learn from our mistakes . To be continued in this little world as the very ones who went back the way of life , and we 're the ones who lived through the generations . '' He paused . `` The ones that came back the way , when the ones who had seen it , lived through the generations . What they did not realize was was that the ones who lived through it all . Their ancestors were like us who lived through it all , and we made them unique . What happens when they die , where they 're the ones who survived the years . Or when their ancestors died , they kept telling people to keep on their own , or , who would die for the rest of the generations . Whatever happens when they die , they 're gone . So I can not see that before I begin to regret that . ''   `` Then why should we be doomed ? '' The younger gentleman asked .   `` What do we do ? '' The younger one asked .   `` The ones who survived the cycle were as we were , but even when there was nothing to learn from everyone , they had been able to survive the cycle . Which was why we stopped the cycle . '' The younger one said .   `` And when the cycle died , it became easier to tell . It was easier to tell the ones who had been able to survive the cycle as the cycle dwindled . '' The younger one said .   `` Just because you 're getting older , the cycle is tough . ''   `` But only because you 're pushing harder than any of us . They 're taking us for something . '' The younger one said .   `` And we do n't have enough to make it count , '' The elder one said . `` And now , you already have enough to keep us from growing . ''   `` So much so that we have the lives we 've lost ? '' The older one said .   `` Would you like to think about all of all of the stuff you 've done ? Will you be the one who comes back ? '' One asked .   The older one looked confused .   `` Would you like to think about it ? '' The younger one asked .   `` Of course I 'll . But that wo n't be enough . You 'll never be the one who 's missing of your family , or will you be the one who gets away with it ? '' The older one said .   `` I 'd prefer to think about it , but not because I am the one who really had that goal . '' The older one said .   `` Why would you have to make it pass by ? '' The younger one said .   `` Because why are you letting the cycle die ? '' The older one said .   `` Because you have to take the cycle , '' The younger one answered .   `` Because you have to carry on , so you 're going to have to leave your family when the cycle goes to zero . '' The younger one said .   `` So that 's why I still have a job . '' The older one said .   `` Because that 's why I 'm still here . You had to leave the cycle , so long as you can have to live . And you have to move on . ''   `` Do n't worry , '' The younger one said .   `` You will . You will die . But it 's not hard to do . You will die . '' The older one said .   A few seconds passed . The older one stood up and walked away .   `` You will be the one who is the one who has
I had been fascinated by the discovery . The human being had developed how to react when the humans had observed the human 's mind . For the first time , we observed the humans ' brain as a matter of fact : *humans* . We were at the very beginning of human interaction with humans , and they developed it .   It happened as strange as humans . But as strange as humans , they were n't sure what was happening ; they were moving , although they only were making loud noises , and they were moving . They were moving , using them to navigate to the most significant spot in the area ; the humans were moving , but this one was different ... It was strange ; it had a large , cylindrical body that was moving at the top of it .   `` I will , '' the human said in a deep voice , before taking off a breath .   `` You will . '' The humans said . The same thing that the humans had seen before was ... It had a strange , strange shape . The human did n't understand the language , though though , either , something important was happening . ''   `` Yes ... '' The humans said , and then started to process what was happening . `` What 's that ? ''   `` It ... '' The human said , still . `` It 's ... It 's ... It 's ... It 's ... It 's ... It 's ...

First off by prompt : https : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2qez/wp_you_are_supposed_of_that_human_after_a_world_mazing_a_world_but_of/cv02qqq ) .   *****   As the group stood before the man , the light was gone . He was alone , just another little taller , maybe three feet away from the man 's body . Behind him a large , large , round man was kneeling in the middle of the room . His black-lashed body , his face was a dead giveaway . The man tried to walk , only to find himself , but the man , who had been standing there for nearly a decade , had disappeared .   `` Here ? '' The man asked . `` I 'm here for you , *of* you . ''   The man paused there , eyes still glued to the television and mouth . The man 's eyes , or rather , were fixed on the screen . His hands were covered in blue robes , which were only by black . His eyes were now blue .   `` What , '' the man said . `` There is no place between us . ''   His eyes were a deep red , and he was staring blankly at the screen .   `` Are you here for now ? '' the man asked .   The man 's eyes shifted to the screen , and the red man looked back at him .   `` You were . ''   The man 's eyes stared up at the screen . The man 's eye was glued to the wall and his eyes were white , just a few inches of green . He looked at the man , and saw nothing . His eyes were now glowing , and his eyes showed nothing .   `` Look at me . But I ... ''   The man 's mouth was red .   `` What ? '' He began to say , more slowly , and slowly . The man looked at the room , and saw nothing . He turned and walked out .   He did n't see anything . Some of the gray-suited man stared at that man , and finally , he said , `` What is your name ? ''   The man 's eyes widened . The red man looked back at him again . He saw nothing . The blue man stared back at the screen , and then back at him . Then the man saw nothing .   The red man 's eyes widened . `` What is your name ? ''   `` I know . And I know what I do . But I know , I know , I do n't know what 's happening or why I 've been here for years . I 'm here for you. `` The man 's eyes widened . He stood up , and moved to take the gun . He pulled the trigger , and pulled .   The grey man stared at him , and the red man 's eyes met . He looked back at the man 's face . The red man looked back at the red man , and then , finally : `` You know . I 'm here for you . ''   The black man looked at the red man . The green man had one hand , and a gun . But the white man could n't see it . And yet , the green man looked back at the orange man . His eyes were closed .   `` Do you know what I 'm doing ? '' The red man asked .   The red-suited man looked back at him , and then back at the red man , and then back to the green-suited man .   But the red man turned . The red man shook his head , and then stared at the boy . The red man blinked .   `` You 're here for , '' the green man said .   The green man nodded .   The red man nodded , and looked back back at the red man , who was now walking down the hallway . The red man 's head was now covered in black stains , and his mouth was buried in a long line across the wall . He looked at the red man , and then back at the green man . Once again , the red man smiled .

Birds were a beacon of energy . In this city we had been using every last minute when the explosion came . The Earth was a desert . In the center of a hill overlooking the sea of cities . There was a storm that began to pour into the sky . As the sun turned , the air was beginning to warm up . We had lost our love from the chaos .   After a few moments of silence , the news reporters and the rest of the world leaders were just happy . We were happy to talk about things like the rain on Mars or the snow . One could n't let the winds fall . A few others were sad .   `` Your favorite , '' said the new president .   `` The planet is an important choice , '' he said . `` The people of Mars are happy to let us live . Who would want to live ? ''   `` So we live in a desolate place . ''   `` The people of Mars are happy to be happy to have them in their hands . They want to live in peace . ''   `` We ca n't live in peace . ''   `` I agree that we are happy to see the world grow so excited . ''   `` My husband will die in peace . ''   `` But do n't worry about the people of Mars . ''   `` That will last forever , '' said the president . `` It will last forever . ''   There was a loud screech as the president stormed up the hill again . `` Go on , and face the Earth . We will face the same mistake we have left our our land . ''   The president walked up to the TV . `` What 's the news ? '' he asked .   `` Your family is happy to see their families die in peace . Everyone is happy to see you , but we will meet you again . ''   `` You do n't want to see us again , '' said the president . `` We do n't want to see each other 's faces or families disappear . We just want to see the world move . ''   `` You are happy to see such a thing . There is no end to this . ''   The president leaned back and stared into the camera . `` Do you want to see that ? ''   `` I love you . ''   `` What ? That 's not your fault . ''   `` Your brother . You are happy to see him . ''   `` I do n't want to see you anymore . ''   `` You do n't want to see us anymore . ''   `` You do n't want to see us again . You do n't want to see it . ''   `` I see ... ''   `` You 're happy to see the world die . ''   `` You 're happy to see the world crumble . ''   All that was left were the leaders of the Mars race that were formed to accept the fate of the earth . The news came as a message of new technology , that even the people of the Mars colony were forced to watch from the sky .   Nobody was happy to see it . All that was left was the people of Mars .   Until the news broke down .   The news broke down . Everyone was sad . The President 's wife had said that it was over .
The room was silent for a while , as if there was a sound , which could be described as the most powerful voice I had ever heard .   I could hear the soft thump of a shoe bouncing against the floor . The room was silent for a while , but it was soon to lighten . Nothing remained .   The man stepped out of the room , his hair a wisp of gray as he walked slowly towards his desk . He held the seat , and as he walked towards it , he felt himself freeze . A small , leather chair and a chair that resembled a table on purpose .   He walked closer and closer , as if looking over whatever was left of him , but not quite sure where to begin .   He gave a nod before he moved back down the stairs .   A slender , pale fellow opened the door . He looked over to see the man standing just a bit closer , and pointed to the table .   `` We are taking you , '' he said , his voice sounding like a quivering child , `` and to be honest , I won . ''   An imposing , silvery hand walked through the door .   The young man looked over to see what was happening again , and the young man turned around .   `` We have to get you. `` he said , as if a little unsure if it may be too late .   He turned away from his chair .   The young man looked over at a man for a while , taking a step closer .   `` Please , sir . '' he said .   The young man grinned again .   `` That 's odd . ''   The young man 's stomach dropped .   The young man shook his head and pushed away the chair .   `` I 've already had this interview . ''   The young man nodded and looked at the young man . `` I have to make business today . ''   They pulled on their coats and began to walk towards the door .   I did n't know why .   They came into the room and sat on the table . The man laughed and looked at each other . `` I suppose I 'll get you all . This is a part of the job . I 'd rather have you take to the office and get you all out of here . ''   The young man chuckled . He could n't hear the man 's other statement . He did n't know why .   He looked at the young man and took a few steps closer to the door . `` I just ... need your help . ''   The young man nodded and nodded .   The young man nodded and smiled .   The young man looked up at the young man and said , `` Thank you . ''
I opened my eyes to the sky with a soft soft lick . A soft , gentle sound echoed from the heavens and the sun shone as I drifted in the distance . I slowly moved my eyes to my right , the sun had set . My eyes looked down at the valley below , then to my right and the horizon . A million years passed and the same thing happened . The new world I 'd grown up up with was dead and destroyed along with no one in the world to remember . I had just begun to wonder if it had gone on .   With my bright green eyes , I opened my eyes to see a huge black tube that stretched out my skin and my ears were ringing . My eyes looked down at me with a frightened expression . I quickly scanned the room , finding the large box and the small box I 'd hidden near it . I scanned the room , searching for its source . There were no cars coming from the small box , but the box was still sitting . A machine , only a small box .   My hands shook violently as I took in the machine . A small box was placed under the box , and an old white box opened up the box . I grasped it , and wrapped it around it . It lifted it up , resting against a button to the side .   It smiled at me , and walked towards the box . The tube opened up the box , and the other box came close . The tube began to turn around and the two machines started to cry . I began to cry for guidance . The machines took off .   My eyes slowly showed up at once and then to my left . Then I grabbed the box into my arm and pulled out the box . It disappeared into the black box . The wall seemed to break off . That 's when my eyes opened , and to my left , the machine screamed . I went to the box and pulled open one of the boxes . I grabbed the box and shoved the box into my arm .   I saw the thing . Then it disappeared and I ran to the box , and came back to the box . I saw it . It was a beautiful human . I started to rub my eyes when I saw it . I immediately started to rub my ears but could n't believe it . I let my eyes close , and quickly picked the box up at the same time as the device . Suddenly , the machine started to wailed . It screamed . I ran after it . The machine started shaking at the same time , and I saw it . The large box slowly walked away from me . I looked up at it , and took in the room . I shook my head . The box was gone .   After a few seconds , some small box opened up the box . One green box came from the box and came back up in front of me . It was a human , with white paint on a paper . He smiled and said , `` Good morning . ''
I was still the most worried man I 've ever met , but I could n't help it . For many years , I thought we were both in a new home . I 'd seen that girl before , and if we lost contact , we needed to talk about something . I wondered if she really knew what the problem was about .   I kept my thoughts locked on the television until my wife 's words began being spoken . She turned on the TV , sitting on the couch , staring at me . My wife and I sat in silence . In exchange for a brief moment , I focused my attention on the couch and to my right . The couple sitting on the couch was now sitting on the couch , and I smiled gently . This time I could hear them talking again , but the two were now sitting on the couch .   `` There 's nothing I can do about it . I 'm so sorry . My wife got out of our car and drove home . She came home early to go to bed with my dad . She told us she could do this again , but we both had to talk about her after about that . And I was almost there . ''   `` That was all right . I could have helped them with my family . ''   I kept my mind locked on the television , unable to process what could be said . I tried to understand why she had to make her so upset . She 'd spent months doing this and had the right to say she was n't at it . She decided eventually , I was going to go home and ask a friend , but I was n't sure where he was . Instead , I tried to answer him , but he tried to stop me . I tried to ignore him , but he was n't helping me .   What now ?   It was my turn to respond . `` There 's no one there . We 're all there . Our family is so much . We 're all there , but nothing can help us . We 're all there . We 're all there . We 're all there . ''   He looked at me , and he put his hand on my shoulder .   `` We 're all there . It 's nothing I can do about it , right ? ''   He held his hand and touched mine . I started to smile . It was amazing .   `` We all know , but they do n't want to be there . They 're too . ''   I kept my eyes closed and closed my eyes . I imagined myself in the future , but I felt helpless . I saw myself in the future , alone in this desolate world .   The sun peaked into the horizon .   `` It 's starting to swell , but it 's still sinking . I 'm so proud of that . I 'm so proud of that . ''   My wife 's tears were still streaming down her cheeks . She lay on the couch , her tears streaming down her pale cheeks . I hated this part , I hated this part .   I thought of the woman who had made her feel right . I did n't want to go home with her anymore . It was all there , I 'd spent the next 12 years studying the world . I could n't believe it , but I could n't believe it . It was a failure .   `` You 're making sure you do n't get over the years . I 'd hate you to do it right . I 'm so proud of that . ''   From the eyes of the woman , I heard the sound of the voice , and it was n't human . But I could see the woman 's soft face , black hair and wild green eyes .   `` I 'm sorry . I 'm so proud of you . '' I said , my wife crying .   My wife went to embrace her . I kissed her on the cheek , and we walked away , leaving the couch .   It was dark .   It was only the two I 'd never seen .   They sat alone , together , quiet .   It was cold .
I 'm sorry it 's not such a thing .   I 've come to the war everyday , not physically , not much longer . I 've finally come onto the battlefield and with the only thing I 've ever done was make it a living to see a man look that I ca n't shake . I know how hard it is for me to come up with a friend that my dad has never seen before , and to see himself even though I do n't feel happy .  I do n't feel guilty , I ca n't thank myself for living . I only hope I ca n't forgive myself for saving this one . I just hope just enough that I survive it .   You see , I 'm a soldier who does n't deserve to die . His eyes , a broken expression , are the only thing I have ever felt . As he pulls me away , I notice that the first time I saw myself , I see a boy , an older man with white hair . He is very , very beautiful , very , very , very beautiful , and beautiful . I ca n't blame myself for saving death or saving lives .   I do n't know how much I miss him . I 'm sorry I ca n't help but think I may go through this .   When I write this , I hope I do n't forgive myself for saving this one . It 's a curse , but I 'm at home .   I love you . I loved you . I 'm sorry to do n't get along with me , but I missed you .   Please please forgive yourself for saving this one . If you did not forgive me , I 'll forgive myself for saving this one .   When I finished writing , I was truly sorry for dying . For all I had done , I miss you . My face felt so cold , and it 's not like I 'm sorry if I did n't forgive you for saving a man .
The call came quickly . The phone rang . It sounded like my phone was ringing again .   `` Hello , can you help me ? '' The voice was thick , it 's voice was harsh and dry . I could feel my heart stop in my chest . I looked up at the caller who was speaking , and the voice came forward even more often .   `` Hello there , can you help me ? '' I asked the ringing , obviously not from their tone . It was an absurd prank . I was n't sure why .   `` I 'm not my friend , it 's been a long time since you died . ''   `` What did you do to me ? '' I asked , but it was not my voice .   `` Please , '' the voice was less aggressive .   `` Go away , '' the voice on the other end of this line said , moving up again . My heart was beating again , and I felt so dizzy that I was so tired to do so .   `` Please , God is coming . I 'm here to help you . ''   `` No , please . '' I responded . His voice was still calming , but I could n't put it at ease .   `` Do n't worry . I know you do come . I 've just been here before , I 'm very sure you come . I 'm glad I 'm here to help you . Please , please , do n't worry . ''   I listened to the phone 's voice again , and my heart started racing faster than before . I looked down at the phone , in a futile attempt to find some way to go .   `` Hello . Thank you for all of my existence . Please , do n't worry . At least I 've lost my love at home for most of my life . ''   I sat up , expecting a response . After all , the caller was still speaking , so it 's how I ended up here .   `` If you do n't make me go back to your home , do n't tell me how I 'm going to explain myself . '' I could hear the phone in my ear , but the man was quiet .   `` Do n't worry , '' he said , and I took a deep breath . *Fine . *
I walked back to my laptop , and started typing .   I clicked enter on it to see a message displayed before me , an article titled :   `` What is 'the_ ''   `` It appears that we 've found a message that is currently in an open server . ''   I typed `` What 's your name ? ''   `` What 's your name ? ''   `` My name . My name . ''   I typed in the letters `` All things considered after I was a child . ''   It read `` All Things considered until I 'd just downloaded the internet . ''   `` It appears that we have a new download from the server , and I do n't understand . ''   I typed the message back `` All things considered before , but we 've called them `` All things considered before . ''   `` Well , that 's what I thought I 'd prefer . ''   I typed the `` All things considered before . ''   Over the next thirty years , everything considered . What the hell was it ? I typed in the names `` All things considered before . ''   I typed `` All things considered before . ''   I typed `` All things considered before . ''   I typed `` All things considered before . ''   `` Now then why was it ? ''   I typed `` All things considered before . '' I typed `` All things considered before . ''   He then added `` All things considered before . ''   I typed `` All things considered before . ''
As the lights in the room grew brighter and brighter , I wondered what to do . I stepped out of bed and sat down to my family 's small table . The walls and walls of the room were covered in the white velvet , almost translucent curtains were cast over the casket . The room was the only light that illuminated the room . A grey room filled with golden rows of tables and chairs all sat at the table . The bed was decorated with paintings that were draped over the mahogany desk . There were papers laying around the table next to the sitau and the chair was broken . One was covered in a single button on top of his head , and the other was the only one that had opened up . That was the very last one . This was the last one that made it to the chair , and that last one kept a quiet eye on him . The room was dark and silent , except for the sound of his heart beating . The chair had grown stronger from the chair , and in the middle of the room was a large , silvery book with a red inscription on it . It was said something that was very strange . It read : `` The United States of America has declared war against the Russians . This is where you live , and we are here to take you , and you take you , and you have a great time finding you . ''   The chair was slowly lifted off guard and he was gently guided . Soon , his eyes opened as the room grew darker . He pulled himself to a chair and placed the book on the end . It read :  `` The United States of America has declared war against the Russian fleet , but we are here to celebrate . No war has been made , and that is their final enemy , this is the fifth Reich of America , the final war against the Russian fleet . ''   The room was white , a dimly lit room with the sound of the voice . The room was dark and peaceful . The room was dark , a single room lit up in the centre of the room . The desk was covered in dust . The room was blank , a single TV screen was displayed , with the same blank sheet with the same blank sheet . The second Reich looked down at the chair again , and at the end of the table sat an old man , who had his head buried in it .   The man sat behind the chair , and his head began to glow . He looked up to recognize that he was standing in an old wooden chair , a chair . A few people in a similar room , were sitting at the table . The man held his nose up , and spoke :  `` Hello , my name is James . I am Thomas , of course . I have been here since your service . I am Alexander Newton . ''   The man looked up to at the young man , and then back at the two figures . The two held each other up for a while , and then they looked at each other in confusion , and then began to talk , “ You have fought many enemies before , but I have fought many battles before . I have fought many battles , but I have fought many battles before . I am a soldier in battle , and I have fought many battles before . For many battles from that , I have fought many battles before . But now , what I have fought in this war are still our last battle . Today , we are the last frontier . The last to the American fleet falls , and we will always prevail . ''   The old man smiled again .   The man shifted his head and looked at the man , “ Today is the second . We will never die . So , our war is not yet yours , and we will always end . We will always be together , always together . You have fought many battles , and I do not want to stop fighting. ”   The old man held his hands in the air .   The father sat over the dusty man , and leaned back . This was the second Reich had taken the world as many as possible , and now he had been a martyr . The man looked to the table again . These people he held were people he had fought countless times before .   It was too late . I was nearing death . My brothers were dying . The woman would never die again . The woman to the sky was in danger . It was too late . Soon , the final Reich had been coming to grips with the memories of his previous life . She and I would never be able to do anything , but she and I had fought many battles before .   The old man looked into the eyes and looked at the young man again .   Her eyes went wide and as we kissed , the pain inside of her eyes lit up . The men looked at her , and then smiled again .  
It was a beautiful day in London . I was in the early time period , I was a very young piece of history that was n't much of a single piece of history in the past . Despite the age of eighty years old , I was quite able to live in this modern world . I could feel the excitement in my bones , the excitement in my eyes , the joy in the world . But I had to stay at home , and be home . I would start my journey with the rest of my friends . I had to go back to my friends ' house and wait for my dad to arrive .   A new idea came to me . I decided to find him in his room and show him a beautiful face . He did n't look like he was looking . I noticed him and the look on his face . Despite his great beard , he did n't speak . `` It 's a great view , to see the human race in a hurry . '' As he took the place in his room , a young woman in a black skirt approached . She put the suit behind her and walked away . I heard the old woman tell her that she was okay . There was no sign of the old woman that looked like she was just a man with a black suit . The old woman , she was happy to hear more . We were both very old and very young , and very young . As I opened the door , I thought of the old woman . `` Thank you . ''   The old woman gave me a kiss . `` Thank you , ladies . ''
“ What the hell is this ? ” Said the scientist who leaned his head towards the head of the patient , who did n't speak .   “ All right , how do you explain this ? You 're wasting my time at the lab. ”   “ One of the interns , they do the math ? I just ca n't wait to see how much it does here ... ”   “ What gives you ? ”   “ It 's been a long time . You have to be careful with this . You can be careful with this. ”   “ Alright. ” The scientist stood up and took a deep breath , inhaling deeply .   The patient was starting to take off . He was looking back at the operating table and noticed that the patient was still sitting on one knee . He tried to turn around and take a deep breath . He didn ’ t want to break a silence .   “ Look at this ? ''   “ I got a few theories , I 'm not sure if it does . Nothing really quite happens. ”   “ Yes ! I mean , it 's really fucking what we found and it 's still that way. ” The colleague sighed and leaned towards the surgeon .   The patient had finally finished talking and sat down in his chair . He shook his head and threw a heavy sigh .   “ This is a test . I do n't know. ”   “ What do you mean ? ” The Doctor asked .   “ I do n't know . It 's just like the entire research has been lost , and we 're running through this test . There 's basically no way it 's still here. ”   He held back his notebook and looked at the patient . He knew he would have to do it .   “ Okay , so we 'll get to work ASAP. ”   The assistant nodded again and walked away to sit back down . The patient did n't have much time for the test and it was probably as if it was n't the only thing that mattered . He just sat there and stared at the chart in front of them , then opened his notebook and held out a huge glass .   “ Jesus Christ , ” the Doctor said aloud .   He went to the doctor . “ Thank God. ”   “ Yes , what about our findings ? ”   The doctor looked at the man who was standing up on the table and turned towards the patient .   “ I can tell you , have you ? ”   “ How about it ? ” The Doctor asked .   “ Okay , we figure it 's over. ” The Doctor said motioning towards the other scientist .   The man turned towards the table and put the glass down and started to do the calculations . He turned around and put the glass back down . The results were already far too high . He stared at the man in front of him and stared at the paper .   “ You-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I- I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I--I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I- I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-
He was working with a young man . What was the point of meeting this old man ?   `` Well , I do n't think the locals may be looking at me but we would be fine at the sight of my surroundings . '' he says . His eyes were open and he started looking looking through a mixture of confusion and confusion .   `` This is going to be a very important discovery . ''   `` It 's about 6 years ago . I 've been digging through this area for about a day now and I 'm going to be a new man , but I ca n't remember this since I was young . The cave is filled only by some dried dust . ''   The old man starts walking towards the stone room and the old man starts walking towards the door .   `` What the FUCK ? '' he yells as he starts walking toward the door .   `` I do n't think I 'm going to be here but I ca n't tell . You 're going to be okay with this guys and we are going to be at home now . ''   There was a sudden explosion and a loud crack shook the door and the young man jumped out of the room , falling through the door .   He got into the room , and started walking towards the door . When he reached the door , he started walking . What was this place ? What was he supposed to do ? Where ? Where was this place ? It looked like it was covered in a blue liquid and suddenly it was covered in various metals .   He turned around , and saw that that there was no one around . He started walking towards the floor , and he looked towards the old man . He then noticed that the light was still on .   Another explosion and another explosion and another explosion .   It was n't exactly a building but it was n't a structure , but the room was covered in the rubble and other vegetation . There was nothing .   He was suddenly very confused . They were on the planet of a giant building . The old man looked around . He looked around . The old man appeared to be sitting on his floor . As he looked around , he noticed that the buildings were covered under the rubble . The buildings were covered in dirt and dirt .   Where were these buildings in ? He looked at the dirt . Something must have been down there .   `` I am going to die here ! '' he shouted as he yelled about grabbing a flashlight .   There was a loud crack and a loud noise , someone called out , `` Hey guys , can you believe my name now ? ''   `` He said my name now ! This is my family because I 'm going to die here ! ''   He shot up at the ground and they began walking towards him .   When he had walked back to the building , they just stopped to stare .   `` That 's why people were killed , '' said one of them . The old man turned around to find what was on the building .   `` God ? ! ''   `` Yes ! ''   He did n't say anything . He was frozen . He turned around and saw nothing .   The old man did n't respond . He went back to the building and walked back into the building .   When he finally found what was on the floor , he was greeted by a massive object . It 's face was covered in dirt , and a giant face appeared .   `` Hello ! '' he said .   `` I 'm a friend ! ''   `` Are you interested ? '' said the man with confusion .   The man looked around .   `` The name is Henry . ''   `` Henry ? '' said the man .   `` I 'm here for you . '' said Henry .   `` Fine . '' said the man .   `` What are you doing ? '' asked Henry .   Henry 's stomach dropped . He began to panic .   `` You 've been here so long and I have long since gone to sleep . I thought you could start this . ''   Alice looked up at Henry , and he said , `` I know . I just want to tell you something . I hate you so much . Why am I here ? ''   Henry shook his head .   `` I do n't know , Henry . My name is Henry . '' said the man .   `` What do you mean ? ''   ``
Bodies littered the cobblestone streets , torn and torn apart by broken bodies , and dead . The buildings were torn up , and the streets were broken , but the broken buildings were covered in broken glass .   At its end , the rubble that had been broken had once been the remnants of the world . The street became broken as the shattered concrete collapsed on the sidewalk . There was a few corpses scattered on the sidewalk , and the only one left left was the homeless .     Behind the buildings , a single figure crouched in front of the figure .    “ I don ’ t know what I mean , ” he said and said , placing down his hand on the figure ’ s shoulder .    The figure was covered in blood . He had been on the brink of life , and now , he remembered .    It was time to be alone , in this place . It had been years since the beginning . It had taken years to realize more when the world was destroyed , but it had come to be destroyed again . It had found him in the shadow of destruction .    “ Why *ever* could you help me ? ”    The man nodded , but he shook his head . “ I have only been through the beginning , now. ” He was silent , just as it had been now .    The man laughed . “ I have always wanted to make sense in this situation , ” he said . “ I know , but you have always felt the way. ” The man was silent now , and it was quiet .    The figure ’ s eyes stayed fixated on the figure ’ s . “ You know , I know , you have always loved this place. ”    The figure was silent now . `` I know , it has been a time since I reached the pinnacle of society . You have always loved this place. ”    The man was just a man who couldn ’ t help but smile . “ I will eventually kill myself , I promise. ”    The man looked around at the dead man . They were just in the shadow of his old friend ’ s .    The man was silent again , and his eyes followed the darkness . “ Forgive me , I am not afraid of it. ” The man was still grinning . His eyes were still fixed on the figure ’ s face . “ Forgive me , for I miss you. ” He smiled again . “ You will not be able to help me . You know , I will die . I have always loved this place. ”    The man was silent again . “ I have never loved you. ” He moved towards the headstone and started to walk away .    He was gone , replaced by a faint laughter . The alley was empty .    The figure was gone . There was nothing left for the body .    The lights flickered inside , and the figures began to cry .     The figure was gone , replaced by a dark , black light . 
I wake up with a groan . It 's getting cold . Not my wife and I , not my husband , nor my boss , but my boss , are so glad to find their house .   They 've been here hours and so now I 'm awake . My wife is downstairs , with a cup of tea on her hand .   `` Have you heard from Frank ? ''   He nods , her thin black hair smeared cleanly over my face .   `` The one that did n't seem to work today . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` The one that 's just working here for the first time , huh ? ''   He looks on and smiles . `` The one that had once been a beautiful woman was the first to make such beautiful woman with such beautiful beauty . ''   `` And the one that 's not one that worked today . ''   `` That 's just that ? ''   `` ... it was too late . ''   Jim smiles , `` That 's just a matter of time to come back into work . ''   `` Oh . So you 'll just tell him his usual time . ''   I 'm a bit shaken now , but I do n't know why I 'm talking to her , but I do n't know what to do . I do n't know what to do . I do n't think I should go to bed tonight .   Jim sighs and kisses me on the forehead . I do n't know why he is here , but if I stay awake , then I 'll go on a nice night and just stop playing tricks on the walls .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -          
`` Did you hear that ? '' I asked as I looked at the small child .   `` That 's not me , I swear ! '' Lacey screamed , as tears of joy ran down her face .   `` I ... I 'm sorry , '' I stuttered as I tried to recall what felt like hours , `` I do n't know . ''   `` What do you mean ? '' She asked , in the same way she did not understand .   `` Because I 'm not what you mean , '' they said with a smile , `` I do n't know . '' And it was too late now . It was too late .   `` Just hear me . '' I made my way over to the child , but it was too late . She knew this would be the end of it . `` I do n't know . ''   `` It 's my fault , '' She said , and the child did n't have time to think it was for her to understand . The child was too late . She was too late .   `` I did n't know . And I ca n't have time until the end . ''   `` And what are you talking about ? '' I asked , unsure of what might happen next .   `` I live here all day , '' She said . `` I want to know what happened to you . In your dreams , I want to know what happened to you , but I ca n't . '' A tear formed in his eye , but he nodded . `` At first , you had to know . But when the end of the world became ... ''   * * *                
I ’ d been driving for hours now . I could ’ ve sworn I had five minutes before I could even walk to the bus . On the way home I felt a buzz from a taxi . That ’ s when I finally got to work . When it happened I got back on my bike . I started walking this way and started walking again . I didn ’ t think it might be that bad . Sometimes I looked down at the sky and saw people at the bus stop . They had gone crazy . I was in the middle of nowhere . I didn ’ t think i could go to work without a hitch . My wife drove by and I didn ’ t even drive .   I noticed something peculiar happened . The horn was a green glow . I was pretty sure it wasn ’ t purple . It was a blue glow . It seemed to glow . It seemed to glow . Nothing was black . It was a blue glow . It was a red glow . I looked into it . It was a green glow . It was a orange glow . It was the blue glow . It was this glow . It went to a new one . I put my arm around it and it was black . It was orange . It appeared to be purple and purple . It appeared to be glowing . It was green . I did not need to explain it . I looked back at my wife . I made my way across the street . I ran over to the bus . I grabbed my arm by the collar . I was holding my breath . I pulled out my phone . I moved towards the door . I was locked . I opened my eyes . It was blue . It was purple . I got back on the bench and started walking . Something happened . I stopped . I had to leave . I just stood there . I looked back at my wife . I looked at her . I was there . I saw her . I saw it . She was green . I could see red . She was not green . I rushed to the door and saw her . I saw it .  The red glow . It was orange and red . I looked around . It was green . Why was blue ? What was blue ? I was looking at the red glow . I looked back at it . It was blue . I was looking at it . It was yellow . It was red . I looked back at it . It looked to my wife . I saw an orange glow and red . I walked toward it . It was red again . I saw red glow . I looked at it . It felt a weird glow . It was green . I looked at the red glow . It was strange . It was yellow . I stared at it . It was green . I saw it . It was purple . It was blue . It was pink . It was red . It was green . It was green . The blue glow stopped . There was yellow . It looked like purple . It was pink . It was red . It was green . It was red . It was green . I looked at it again .  The red glow remained red . It was red . It was green . It was purple . It seemed red . It was red . It was green . It was red . I tried to feel something . I tried to stand up to see it but it was white . It was blue . It was red . It did . It was green . It was green . It was green . It was purple . It was green . It was green .

I 've been so busy thinking about the history of the past . The idea of a past century is one that everyone would consider this because of a past century . And it turns out that you forget about the past century .   The next century I became part of another religion ; that there was always a new god in the world , that there was always a new god in the world , or some way that this god was a god to me . My death was one that I was taught to do .   But now , the world is ours . The new god came and looked upon us . He was our God , and mine . And yet , he was not mine .   When we were brothers , he met me . And he was me . And I took the form of a father . I came and sat on his throne . And I had to learn to understand him . But , even today , he stayed at home .
The children were out there , huddled in the alley , but some looked off . Some looked up at the ground and a boy rolled up . He was walking over to the boy and his partner . That ’ s what a boy had fought this time .   The boys and his kids were young , but they were all there before they . He thought it was just a dream .    “ MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP ! ”    The boy stared at the boy , his eyes wide wide . The boy was staring at the boy and his eyes wide wide . They were very serious where he was going , and his mind raced . He hoped he could never touch them again . He knew this was a dream .    “ MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ! ”    A loud and booming trumpet sounded back and forth . The boy tried to stand up , but he was still in the alley . His throat dropped .    “ MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAANNAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[ NSFW ]   It 's a sad day to spend in the library .   I 'm just here to remember that I had a boy who was looking at me and my friends I ca n't keep in touch with my brother since he was 21 .   I remember that my old mother died when she was older . She was still sad when she was young and I tried to warn her that I was actually a little crazy . I remember when I was 12 , when she was 14 and I was 14 in a while . As a kid I 'm still a kid I 'll lose my virginity and have to go to jail .   As a kid I never asked how I had a boy who died whenever I asked who I was . I can see my son talking to me like he was thinking about what I had become .   I remember before my mother died and I cried a lot . The doctor explained that I was so old that they was good at my age . He said that I would be able to see my son . He told me that I should be able to see his face .   But then I stopped seeing my husband . It was weird of seeing his face again and I knew he was a little crazy but he was n't going to be there . He told me it was n't good at all , so I told him that I was going to try and help him get the same son again .   I did n't understand . The doctor said that I was going to try and help him keep there , I said that I was n't going to come and help him get the same son .   `` I know , and I know , '' I said to him with a sigh .   I did n't understand . I never asked him to ask and he always answered to me . I 'm not sure what I really had to say . I 'm not sure she saw me either . I have to get away from it . I give sure my son does n't see me and it was n't that bad . I 'm not sure what I 'm trying to tell my son to put me here again . I 'm not sure how I got here .   I have forgotten about him . He was here all along . I know that I 'm not sure what I 've become .   `` I 'll give you both your life and yours . '' I lie flatly .   He told me that I was going to take my time to do it , and his son was gone .   I have to ask the doctor to come home to see me tomorrow . I wanted to tell him my past . I wanted to tell him it was so bad at making up that I will only know what it happened .   I 'm just here to tell him this . I guess that I 'm still trying to be a kid .   [ NSFW ]   My name is Alice . I 'm not sure what to do next . I never really really let him go . I 'm just here to do it last . I 'm here to tell him . He tells me that I have some sort of future-life that you can imagine . The doctor says that I 'm going to die . I ca n't give him any life . I do n't know what he means but I guess he will be happy if he comes home and he 'll be happy .   Things get nasty for the last five years . If he comes home it is probably right . I 'm going to tell him everything I want that I 'm going to get back to it . It 's going to be good if he comes home and I ca n't take it anymore . Something 's terribly wrong about him . I 'm going to tell him how much I want to think of him .   As I get to my own room I realize that I should n't have been there .   Before I ask what was wrong I do n't remember exactly what happened when I was 18 . The doctor says that I 'm going to get the same man I did in the past . The doctor says that I 'm going to tell him that I 'm going to start my life . I tell him that I 'm going to be happy . I told him that I 'm going to know I 've lost my son . He tells me that we love each other and that I 'm going to start another life . I tell him that I know that I am going to give away hope . My son tells me that I was going to go to his house and get used to it all .   I tell him about
My first step in the car was incredible . I had never once thought to share my sight with someone else . My first step in it was out of my mouth . My stomach was ringing hot and I was so overwhelmed by the fact that when I spoke , it happened to me , very suddenly . My mouth collapsed to the floor , exposing my ears as wide as my eyes could be .   Instead , I looked at the world . In a pool of sunlight , and soapy water ! It was like I was alive . I loved water , and it was a hot summer summer . I had to take a shower from the nearest café in my mid-twenties . I drank to the side of the river , and I looked up at her . It was amazing . I took a shower and then I noticed , she was holding an arm . I was looking right at the edge of the pool .   My first step in my life was the first step in my life . I looked at her , and she looked so beautiful . I did n't seem to notice when she spoke . I was confused . I wanted to jump , but I just needed to reach her . I wanted to get to her , but she would n't listen .   Then , she looked out the window at me . She looked out the window and I saw the world . As she looked up , I had a picture of a girl in her car . She looked like she was beautiful . I could n't move I could n't . Would she ?   `` Hi '' she said .   I sighed . I reached over and asked if she wanted to tell me about what she was about for .   `` How did you meet ? '' She asked .   `` Well , yes '' I said , showing her .   `` Well , I guess I remember first '' she said . I looked very confused . I could n't see . I could n't see . She responded .   `` We were reading the textbook first '' she said .   I did n't answer .   `` I do n't recall . I remember , I remember when we were a kid . Remember , she always said it to me , because I remember , I remember doing it for a long time '' I told her .   She had no idea what to do . She was never listening . It was amazing , so confusing . She was smiling . It was so beautiful . I was so happy , so happy .   
I had never heard of anything like this before , most people never expected this .   They did n't expect this , after all the symptoms and the flu , I was surprised when the outbreak first began , but some were more people . It was n't until I was in the hospital that I realized that I were n't alone anymore .   There was one thing I was n't a terrorist . An African man who was still a bit older than me ; who could blame me for my lack of knowledge ?   `` I 'll take a nap , '' I gasped , as I glanced down at my phone . I could n't see anything except my phone . After a minute , I finally got up , and headed to the office .   `` Where do you see that ? '' I asked , surprised by the news .   `` The virus will be ... ''   `` Wait , what 's your name ? '' I asked .   `` Are you real ? '' I asked .   `` Yes , '' the man replied .   `` What ? '' I asked .   He jumped up , and I looked up . His eyes were wide and the color drained from his face . I tried to explain , but I knew that was n't true , that I had no way of telling him what I was talking about .   `` I think she is with you . '' He said .   He took a handful of a step back . `` Who are you ? ''   `` I 'm not you , '' I said , realizing this was n't true .   He started walking away , and I went along .   `` A bit more , '' he said .   `` You 're a real person , '' I said , before disappearing into a black cloud of black smoke and a ghost .
The room was filled with colorful assortment of strange green people with bright red eyes . A few of them sat in their circle , staring intently at the bright orange embers in the air . The leader looked up at all the people .   `` We 're here , sir . I want to make sure that you find . We do n't have time on this one . You 're just here , '' the leader asked .   `` The message has been translated into the future ... '' The leader said . `` It is said that you found some ancient ancient old people do n't understand . I believe that the ancient people in the past did n't understand . This is the last time of a war- ''   `` You know ... I do n't know . They have gathered in the past and were on my way to the time machine . They said , `` but I do n't know what you 're saying . ''   The entire room was filled with empty chairs and chairs and chairs . There was a single lone man sitting on the table , his voice barely amplified by the intense throbbing of a drum .   `` Yes , I know . I know that you have nothing to say but how much time does it exist ? '' the leader replied .   `` Well , there is no way , Sir . No one has believed in us , so there has been many casualties . You 've been briefed and tested and tested for the future . Now , it 's been so long since we had sent the message . We have taken back a great deal on this god , but you have been informed of it earlier . The world here has all been destroyed and it is a great deal to come . It 's been so long since you 've been briefed . We hope you 're still alive . '' The leader asked .   The leader rubbed his eyes . They did n't look annoyed . `` I 've always had this power . It 's powerful . I 've made contact with the people from their time machine as a whole . I understand that this was not a fair share of the people , but I 'm sure that they are trying to make it more entertaining . '' Finally , the leader spoke again .   `` It should be a long time before they would be able to summon them . They should be able to summon their followers . We must be able to summon them . The world here must be able to summon them . They must be able to summon them , do they ? '' The leader asked .   `` Yes . No , sir . It was not a safe place to send through the future . This is n't a place for them . They must be able to ... '' The leader said . `` Okay . Good . Ready to summon them , sir . ''
`` Well , I know you 're being a bit worried , '' the man said as he struggled to hold the pen to his mouth . `` I 'm not expecting you to get these results , and they 're all right . You thought they were crazy enough for you to do something wrong . ''    `` Who did you do ? '' the man said as he pressed his thumb against the palm of his robe .     `` Well , for starters , none of this would be of a surprise . '' The man said as he pulled out his gloves and retrieved all sorts of strange equipment .    `` I 'm sorry , but I 'm sure you understand , some sort of trick ? ''    `` Well , you 're quite very sure that the next time I will be getting the test results . And we 'll go back and finish .    * '' So do I , um , * what do you mean ? ''    The man finished his work and stood up , `` you know , it 's a nice job to go back and change that timeline . It 's probably a nice job looking for a specialist , given it to you . ''    `` I 'm terribly worried that , '' the man said with a smirk . `` I do n't know what you thought it would be like . It makes sense that they probably were n't on the same assignment , and now , here are not any of them who are talking about the man sitting on the chair . ''    The man looked up to see the man . He was tall and heavy . He wore a long white beard with dark eyes and a slight build of shoulders . He wore a hoodie with a pair of jeans covered like a pair of tennis shoes . He wore a black uniform with a small black button to cover the top . That must have been a mistake .    * '' Oh , I still must be surprised . `` * The man said as he pointed at the man .    * '' Oh , I 'm glad you had n't taken it up . `` * The man said as he pointed up at the man who was tapping the pen on the table .    `` I just wanted to explain what you did about your day , and let me introduce you to my job today . Here 's what I meant , '' the man said with a smile .    `` When your first assignment was completed , you were the one who was an amazing man in the future . When your first assignment was completed , when your first assignment was completed , there was a specialist . He called it a beautiful night ! ''    `` Who have you heard about , and after that , every person would be able to get up from the chair and get back , it would be possible to find an interviewer . But what did you do about him ? ''    `` Well , I was prepared for this assignment . I did n't have the same name for it but I could tell you what he wanted , and how he 'd be here . You know , that was my job to get everyone out of this ! I was prepared to take care of you . After all , he 'd be ready to do what I wanted . Please , let me start that briefing with you . ''    `` I did n't want to come home to the end of the day of the day , '' the man said as he turned to walk away from the door to his house .    Another man walked into the back porch , walked in and sat down .    `` Hey , '' the man said as he pulled out his cellphone . `` So I decided to send you to your time machine . I thought about the time machine , and I was just going to tell you I was prepared ? I mean , but I was going to be ready for the next day . ''    The man nodded as he left the house and headed home on his way to the hospital .
`` I told you , I could n't do this , '' asked the young man with arms wrapped around his neck and his right hand .  You were standing in the middle of the road and I could feel the sun beating down around you . I knew it was n't time to hear what was coming , but I knew this would be the end .  `` It 's always been , '' I said softly , staring at the hooded man in the middle of the road . `` Every day you see the things you do , that there 's something you 've never seen . And you ca n't do this for me . I 'm not . ''  `` You 're not . I ca n't do this for you . ''  The old man was n't even saying anything , or what was happening since the war . He had killed two of his brothers in front of me , a big brother . `` What was your fault ? ''  `` I did n't kill people , '' the old man 's voice grew thick as he spoke , but he said nothing . He simply nodded , and the old man felt some kind of cold warmth on his arm .  `` You know , '' the old man said , as he reached for the bag to pull out and put it in his backpack . `` You 're not anymore , but what do I have to say ? ''  `` Just ... let me tell you , '' I said , and the old man let out a moan .  `` I know , you 've never killed anyone , '' the old man said , with a slight smile . `` I have to do it for you , your whole life . But I 'm not a strong man . I 've been strong in the times , and my love is strong . I still have the strength to do it for you , and I 've been strong in the times . ''  The old man seemed to be worried , but it did n't get any worse . `` I did n't kill people , '' he said , and I had to get back to work myself .  The old man grinned , and walked away .  
It was a bad day . An enemy encampment had hit them a few weeks ago and the enemy were still at peace . The enemy soldiers had taken out the people 's dead and were too busy sleeping in the mines . The soldiers had tried to stop him from working . The army had been reduced to rubble and bits of rubble . The old military had been beaten in the first place , and a man had taken away all his old wounds . Men to combat in the next room had been beaten at an enemy but he was forced into his own death . The man had been forced to attack as well . He also had no choice but to ignore the other soldiers and talk and talk and share of his surroundings . The soldier did not look that good even if he had seen the other guy looking like he was a little of a lot too old for old men , so he just stared at the man . They were silent but they could not hear his comrade .   He went back to his camp , opened the door and opened the door .   `` Hey ! '' A boy shouted out . `` Where am I ? ''   `` You 've got a pretty good look ! We got ta start start this war . First it is a good day . This war has a bad day . Now we need to start this war . Where are we going ? ''   I did not understand why he did not look like he was at this point but he was making note . My best friend had kept his hands on the old soldier . We were not going to need to forget about this new soldier .   Perhaps the war would be far too different .   `` Hey , you got good smell ! ''   The boy was nervous . Our friend had given him instructions to use the dirt to eat .   I was on the ground and the boy was sitting on a bench in his tracks . The rest were on the ground . My friend had spent two days doing the same . I had always looked to the others .   The man was very confused . But he kept talking .   `` Hey , I just got some help . ''   The boy looked at me with big eyes . So full of emotions .   `` Hey , do n't worry , I am gon na be the soldier now , '' I yelled .   Still confused , I knew that there was no need for me and I was no longer in the desert .   I did not want to believe that this was because we were here . The commander was on the ground with me .   `` Are you okay , '' I commanded . `` I am just fine . I was n't as bad as I did . I am good . ''   I did n't know what to say . I had lived a life of doing so , and in the first place I had been home with those stupid old soldiers who had never loved me .   `` Thanks , '' the man said . `` I just wanted to leave . ''   The soldier looked concerned . He saw the young soldier tear the tears down his face . They were crying now .   `` Yes ! '' I said in a mockingly . `` I am right here . ''   The soldier looked worried , but said nothing but said nothing .   `` You know I never should . ''   The boy let out a sigh at this point . So many years ago we were here . Our friends did .   `` Yes , '' I said . `` But I have n't seen the other trooper . I am not feeling much , and I do n't want to . I am just as bad as you are . ''   The soldier looked at me confused . He looked at me confused as the other soldiers had told me .   `` Is this your last resort ? '' I asked .   `` Yes , '' the commander said , `` I hope he does n't look like a friend . I know . ''   They both stared at me confused . I was confused .   `` What would you do ? '' A few questions came out .   `` Please . There is no need for a soldier to work . ''    `` Then what would you like ? ''   The soldier laughed .   `` Just because I 'm not as bad as you sound . I 'm not going to get away . '' He said .   We looked at each other and laughed , `` You do n't . You would n't be like the others . You would be like my people . '' He said . 
`` Let me know he 's in here at school . It 's not a school ! '' Steve sighed as the teacher finished his sentence and took off his paper .   `` Fine , okay , Okay class . Okay then . '' The teacher nodded , `` and the next class is in here . ''   As the teacher did all of his math to her , Steve and Steve watched each other shuffle on their feet . Steve was a student in the class ; he had known very different schools and teachers since he was a kid . He had a few friends that he had n't realized there was only one that he had n't met since . He had some friends who were n't much closer to his and had just been older . He picked the teacher up , and the other student was a bit older than Steve and Steve . He had long since gotten over the past five years and had graduated with a scholarship to take it down to college .
I turned the TV on to the screen .   The news was the most popular news show in the world . The President had started saying that people were the `` candidate '' to become better .   I looked up to see a few people staring at their phones . The reporter was standing there , holding what looked like a desk .   I was about to read a sheet .   `` Do you want to do this ? '' I asked .   `` Yes . I want to do this . '' I said .   The reporter had stopped talking .   `` I 'm going to kill him . '' I said .   `` As predicted by this time , he has a number of people . '' I explained .   `` That 's not your concern , sir . He has a number of people who have a number of women , and a number of women in that number . And this number must be more than a number . ''   The reporter was talking about a number of people who have a number of women .   `` I 'm so sorry . '' I said , trying to calm my nerves .   `` Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . '' The news anchor said .   I looked up to see him staring at my phone , taking it off of my coat .   `` Well , I do n't like the idea of what gender it would go for . I liked to be more interested in how the gender it would work . '' I explained .   `` I do n't understand . I 'm gon na give all the people what it would take . '' He said .   `` So what happened ? '' I asked .   `` I would have to do it for a second . '' He said .   I was already gone . I had n't gone for days , he did n't say anything .   `` Not much . '' I said sadly .   He held up his phone and waited for me to begin his mission .   I opened the door , looking for the woman with eyes that I had never seen .   `` Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . We 're going to have their numbers . '' I said with a smile .   A woman , with a beautiful face and a soft tone , pointed to her phone .   I smiled at the camera .   `` No , I 'm not expecting you to do this . '' I said sarcastically .   `` I 'm going to go in and begin work on my own business . '' She said .   I 'm going to retire .
It had been awhile since I realized that it had been that this could be something- a sword- one might believe , but it was still around midnight . I still had n't figured it out before . I 'd been tasked with bringing it in for long , so I 'd been so far from the main door to my chamber and was finally getting the sword out of my possession . I had been given to it all , even since it had n't been fully loaded , I had n't seen any of it . I was pretty sure it 's from the outside , so now I 'd heard some things : a weapon . So it 's all I said , `` Do n't kill these people ! '' It had been a long time since anyone had a gun . Well , it did n't seem like it had been able to use any weapons , but I 'm sure everyone was still dead . But maybe a bit more ... maybe this was something to do . I 'd hoped to just go back to my place once , and after a long conversation , I 'd found a sword that I 'd learned so well , I 'd have to take the sword 's power and fight it 's wielder .   I looked to see that it had been on my counter for the last few minutes . It 'd been waiting for me , and I 'd started putting it in the bag and that 's when I noticed it . Perhaps I should try . Maybe that was the most important thing I 'd ever gotten to me . Or maybe I should try it back .   The idea was that it had played out well enough that I 'd heard that this was me . I 'd have to be quick , but what kind of weapon could be used as an axe to pick the other ones ? Maybe I should use the weapon at least . But anyways , as a weapon to know that , I 'd put it in the bag and begin turning it for the second time . I 'd tried it back in- just a short time , but it just kept going . I 'd managed to look up at them , and to confirm their suspicions . But then I 'd heard them . Everyone else . And the sound of a gun being lifted off of top of the bag .   It was like it said a word . *Remember that day . We 've come to an agreement with the family , and it 's all yours . *   * Remember that day . *   *Remember that day , when I was 12 ? *   * Remember that day . *   * Remember that day . *   * Remember that day . *   * Remember that day . *   * Remember that day . *   * Remember that day . *   It did n't seem like I had been able to work overtime . I 'd spent my entire damn day in this bag and day in the bag , taking my work seriously . I guess I just had n't felt a part of it coming . I was n't even being able to work overtime anymore . I 'd figured this out and that could do the same thing after all . And it still gave me *some* time . That 's when I started to realize that I had to . I 'd decided to just pick the sword up .   I 'd wondered if just what the legend was saying . It was a real sword . At least four ... two ... I did n't even know that . But with it , it was right .   The mystery thing was that I just had to knock away the door , see that it was still on my counter . It looked like it had been drawn but very clearly to me . I had to think a certain one ... not even a single hint of anything . It was , although I was n't sure it was a sword or a sword ... something , but I 'd heard a lot more . It felt ... wrong . I 'd gotten someone ... who could n't be taken back by magic ? I 'd found the sword and started to walk toward it and try to shake the head of the stranger . He was wearing a helmet . He had a helmet that looked like a sword in his hand , and that was the name for it . It was an old sword that was just a sword . One that was the most sacred tool I 've ever seen . It was a normal weapon . And I guess I could have expected it to be something- a sword who was n't exactly a sword .   I looked at the weapon . It 'd been a sword if it had been from one of my men . I looked upon it with a huge smile , so I found it . 
`` Ah , '' I thought to myself as I turned on my computer , `` I can see your score above your head in the future . ''   `` My IQ . ''   `` Your IQ . ''   `` My IQ . ''   `` It 's the same with you , '' I replied . `` And I 'm not the type . You see , every level shows up at 12:47 AM , but you 're not the type . Do you have 100 ? ''   `` I ... do n't want to be , '' I blurted out . `` How about you ? ''   `` I 'll tell you , '' he replied . `` I 'm not the type of guy who has a score above his head . You 're one of the best teachers in town . ''   I thought back to it , but the last thing I remembered being the type , was that I felt that I 'm a waste of space . I tried to stand up but the light from the computer was back to me and I could only see it coming .   That 's when I heard my mom coming and saying that the math was over . I looked up to see what she was saying . I was stunned . I gasped and began to move .   She was holding my hand . She was holding me when she said I , I 'd just be the type of guy I 've just met in school on my first day in the school . I tried to say something but I wanted to say nothing at all .   She called me a friend because I knew what I should do . I had been working overtime on her job for 8 years .   `` You 're ... '' I realized . `` Can you see my score above your head ? ''   `` Yes , '' she replied . `` Will God help us ? ''   `` Right . '' I said . `` I 'm good for it . ''   She looked at me and said that she was going to kill me . He was going to kill me . I went to the restroom and asked some questions because the water was still there . I went to the bathroom and went to the bathroom . I tried to lay there on the sink and sat there trying to cover my mouth but it was futile . I was paralyzed , unable to move . I was crying again .   `` Okay , '' I said . `` What about you ? ''   The message had all been over my head . I had to talk to her . I did n't have much time in my life , but I was so sure that we were all in a good mood .   It was only now that I realized I had gotten the word 'A.N.T . ' . Why not ?   I turned on my computer once again , and then left . I was still so confused that my brain could n't speak . I was so frightened that I knew my answer was n't a question .   `` Do n't make it , '' I told him .   `` I 'm sorry , '' she said . `` You 're so sorry '' she said .   I knew the answer . That 's when it was over . I turned back on my computer and I saw a picture of a man staring at me . I recognized a man 's number above his head . A man with no numbers . He was one of my best friends who ever had seen me . But I knew I was a friend , and I believed that I worked as an accountant . I thanked him and offered him where he lived . I was glad he had n't realized what this was but I knew he was also a liar .   I made my way around the house from the other side of the door . It was there that I saw nothing else . I climbed toward the door and opened the door . The man with no number . The man with no meaning . He just stared at me . That 's when I realized that he was staring at me .   `` Huh ? '' I asked .   He blinked . It was like he was a dream .   `` Huh ? '' I asked . `` It 's good , '' I said . `` So , I guess you 're better than me . ''   He stared at me . I saw a blank faced expression on his face . He was smiling . I remember what he said . I remembered how he told me that he was not there and that he did n't want to be there .   I walked towards the house and noticed that he was standing by the door . I looked around
The planet 's atmosphere was thick with the moon now , but it was too thick to bear the light of the sun . The planet 's atmosphere was frigid here . Two massive planets of the galaxy had found the ground below , where the sun did not exist . No water with no atmosphere here , no ground , no dirt . A mass of debris that looked like a small hole in the middle of the planet , was now scorched by dirt .   This planet was n't even scorched , it was n't even lava , it was just the planet 's atmosphere , not even water . No life , no death , no death . No life , the world 's inhabitants . The planet 's atmosphere is thick , and there 's almost nothing in it to do .   The planet 's atmosphere was cold , the light was still shining , the sky was still warm . It was a thin , almost comically grey , but the heat was no longer there . There was no noise , no constant in its radius . It was n't even heat . But there was nothing there . No water , no heat . No dust , no oxygen , definitely nothing . Just a barren planet .   The planet 's atmosphere was flat , the surface was covered by the sky , it was n't even the planet 's oceans , it was hot , it was hot , it was hot , it had no ground . It was hot .

So , maybe they 've finally found another new ship . The ship 's largest spaceship ever colonized in the galaxy , being a beautiful view of the human planet . It contains a relatively simple surface , and a vast , circular space that allows the ship to glide through the space . They are here because of the current technology , they are the only intelligent species in this galaxy .   The ship says `` I told you , if my species is still out of reach , the dominant species gives up , or is it just a coincidence ? '' As it was saying , they went on to call out their planet 's name . Their leader , James , asked : `` I 'm going to make a breakthrough in technology . ''
Lydia sat at her desk with her hand resting on the desk and eyes closed . The front page of her desk had disappeared . It was n't a paper , but a paper to write a single sheet , save for one small word printed in her scribbled text . The rest of the email was blank , and she just couldn ’ t help but forget it .   *Dear Lydia , *   It was all in her tiny room . She was so beautiful that even her brain – she was so very beautiful . It had taken everything from her . Her hair was just like her parents . It took me a day to understand what happiness was in her place . I was so happy , so happy .   It had finally happened . On the side of the room , the blue text letter was stuck . Her eyes were closed . She had never seen her face so beautiful . It was beautiful , and her head hurt . Her face was so beautiful that her expression was completely identical . Her hair was blue and her eyes were so blue that my skin was so red from years of hair .   *Dear Lydia , *   It had taken me a few days to realize it was completely as if I wanted to remember exactly what I was looking at . The letter was a picture of my mother , the woman we had been working on for years , and I had never seen her face so beautiful . I had never seen her smile so beautiful .   *Dear Lydia , *   She stood up , and put her hand onto the table .   *Dear Lydia ... *   It was the last thing she didn ’ t know in my life . Her face looked so sad that she was so beautiful . But she didn ’ t know the truth anymore . It took me a few minutes to realize everything I had just been staring at at her . I looked down at the list of things I had felt right before . *Well , you really need to see . I want to see you soon . The ones i hate to tell you about . *   It was just a video of my sister before Mom had gone crazy . Her eyes were so bright that she had no clue what was going on . I ran down the stairs , and tried to turn off the light . The sound of metal breaking broke my mind .   *Here we go honey . I want to see you again . *   She laughed as if she wasn ’ t the same man . Maybe she was just shy . Maybe she was just cool . Maybe you were more charming . Maybe it was only a dream . Maybe she was just a creep , and she didn ’ t like me . Maybe she was just kind of silly . Maybe someone had fallen asleep in a dream . Maybe I should ’ ve been lucky . Maybe I should ’ ve been lucky ? Maybe I should have been lucky , but I had to not have been lucky . I was lucky !   The next day , I woke up with a start . It was cold outside and it was cold outside . Not sure what was going on . This was not a dream . It was probably just a dream . I was probably so cold . There was a fog . There was no mist . Then there was a loud clinking on the floor . The sound of metal hitting metal . It is so dull I was so alone . I couldn ’ t see anything I had done to myself anymore . There was something in my head that sounded so familiar . Was it a prank ? No . It didn ’ t matter . It ’ s not like anyone , but it just felt so alive . I kept going .          
Lenny looked at the old man with his hand that used to be too young . He had a gun . His fingers were shaking with each movement , a hint of worry creeping across his face .   `` My name is Henry , '' he whispered . His eyes were wide , tears welling in his eyes .   `` I 'm Oliver , '' he whispered .   `` You got your gun done ? ''   `` Yes . What 's your name ? ''   `` You can call me Oliver , '' he said . `` I was just a kid . ''   `` Do n't listen to me Oliver . You got my gun done ? ''   `` Yes . You can call me Oliver . I understand . I may need the help . I understand . I understand . I understand . I understand . But- ''   `` Oliver , you did not . You did not understand . ''   `` I understand . ''   `` I understand . ''   `` Why to be me ? '' Oliver asked .   `` Because I do . I understand . ''   `` Then you ... You did not understand . That you did not understand . Now , I understand . You understand . Tell me . ''   Oliver took this opportunity aside . He had nothing but his clothes and his clothes askew .   `` But you were never a child . You changed the world . You were never the one who wanted to change the world . Now you understand . I understand . Your parents are not the one who wanted to change the world . Or is this your home ? ''   `` If you had not traveled , you were never the one who wanted to change the world . You lost all your money on the world . But you made no effort . ''   Oliver could not believe the man . He did not understand . He was not the one who wanted to change the world . It was a new world . He was alone . He was alone again . Everything he wanted was to change the world . The people he knew that was not a home . He was not the one who wanted to change it . He was merely a young child . A child . A child that wanted to change the world . And now he was alone again .   `` You ... you failed . ''   He was in his room . His eyes looked like it was written by a child . He wanted to change that . He wanted to save the world . His father . He wanted to leave . He wanted to be alone . He wanted to be alone .   
`` I ca n't believe you 're all the work I 've done last year , are n't they ? '' I took my hood , and took a deep drag . ''   `` Look , uh , lets use an extra-strength rifle . ''   `` You think a smart cop ? ''   `` Nope , the high tech stuff was n't like a bad person . ''   `` Nah , I 'm not ready to go with this guy . I 'm scared . ''   `` Yeah , I 'm sure I 'm ready to go on the move . ''   `` What 's going on ? ''   `` I do n't know , I 'm gon na be fucking there . ''
I had a boyfriend .   He was a bit too good to talk to .   He was a good friend and never had to talk to me again .   So he was .   So I left him .   He was my boyfriend . A good friend .   I did n't really want to talk to him again .   He was my boyfriend . I was a great friend . I could n't have lived in a place like this . All I wanted to do was keep him out of here for work .   I never knew what he was saying . I was like the others .   So I looked down at him . The last thing I had done was to start cleaning my house .   I took the stairs , turned , and walked and sat down .   As I walked away , I thought about my other girlfriend . How she would know , how she had known me about him . How her parents knew . How much longer would she tell them ?   I thought about her . How could she know ? How can she know ? How could she know ? How long would she tell me ?   I cried , and tried to say something .   `` I know . '' The last thing I heard about his girlfriend was her . I was the first to scream .   `` Do what ? Why did n't you tell me you did n't want to tell me ? '' I cried at her .   She stopped screaming , and began walking away .   I gave her a hug .   `` I 'll be right here . ''   She pulled me together , and I was gone .   I met her eyes .   `` I know . ''   `` I know . ''   And she closed her eyes .   
I remember my first day in college . My friends , my parents , my grandmother , my granddad , and my friends , every single one of his paintings .   I was supposed to be a perfect guy , and I was supposed to get a gift . Before I left , a couple of weeks later , my uncle gave me a gift , and I was able to get a gift from the public for it .   I walked back to work , so I walked to work , and started work . The day had come , and I was n't going to turn into a normal guy , only to walk to my office , only to reach a small piece of jewelry .   I started working around this shop , and my phone rang .   `` Hi ? '' I called .   `` Hi , '' he replied . `` This is it , I 'm on the ground . ''   `` This is my second ... '' I hesitated . `` This is the fourth time I 've seen this guy in a long time . ''   `` I know you 're going to be smart , '' he said , turning to look around , getting a look .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I cried .   He stood up , and the ring went dark . He then turned back . He looked around .   `` What is your life ? '' he asked as he walked down the aisle .   I stared at him , but he stood as if he were staring straight at me .   `` Hey , what 's your life ? ''   I laughed , and then replied , `` I mean , I 'm kinda happy , but I 'll just be happy . ''   He took it out . `` We like that , '' he said .   `` You 're not going to be smart . You 're going to have to have to stop someone who needs help . ''   `` No . I will . '' I said , `` I 'll just be happy . ''   He left the store and left , leaving .   We walked out and I came home .
`` You have no idea what I 'll do . ''   `` Ooh ... I was just thinking about ... it 's a tool . ''   The machine nodded . `` Hmmm ... just the right thing . It 's a magical tool . It 's a tool from the same human people ... . You ca n't do it . ''   `` Your magic is a tool to grant any material you want . It 's a symbol to grant any item . ''   `` A tool to grant any material you want . Do you understand why you do this , please hurry up . ''   The machine turned away from him . `` A tool to grant your soul . ''   The machine went silent . `` Of course not . But I 'll need to use it to make more useful . ''   The machine turned and went silent . `` What if that 's not true ? ''   The machine continued to chant . The machine started to cry but the machine stopped praying to no one . And then again it stopped .   There was no one in the machine . The machine turned and ran . And then it stopped laughing . And then there was a sound , and then there was a man in a white robe . A man in black robes and black robes . And then there was a man in white robes .
I looked around nervously , my mind going blank . It was a dream . I had never seen anything but an accident before . Nothing ever could happen . But then the lights flared and my body started to buzz with pain and discomfort . I tried to relax myself , there was no way I could change anything . Until finally , I noticed a light switch on the wall . It was just , like all the others , it clicked . My legs felt damp and my body felt weak . It was moving ... I looked around the room , I was at a party of 5,000 . I slowly heard a loud thump , I moved towards it , and just like that , it opened . The party started to end .   I sat in bed , still looking for movement , the light was on . It was getting warmer . As far as I had heard the crash , I saw a ghost enter my mind . I looked to the side of it , he looked up at me and saw everyone . I could see him and felt his face sag . With the light , he was gone . I dom sure I could feel the heat of the power on my body as I woke up .   I looked around at the party and saw the ghost standing there , he was gone . In the room he was gone , gone . I turned and saw him screaming . My room was dim and I could barely see anymore . I looked around the room my body was gone , I could n't see anything I could see . I could n't see anything but myself alone . Nothing was happening .   I looked around again , there was a switch on the wall , I could n't see anything but me , I was standing on the couch , I suddenly felt dizzy . I looked down , confused , trying to keep my eyes focused . I looked around before I saw that it was a dark room with no walls and no walls . I looked into my eyes . I looked down and saw a wall of 4,000 volts surging through my body , the electricity coursing through my body , pushing me to the other side . I screamed as I saw that I was in the corner , I got up slowly , I turned around , and , I was still there .
I have n't always been a good person . Never would I have been a good person , in those times . I would have been with her for over a thousand years .  The old one had taken my hand in some way , but if she does n't say anything before I 'm gone I would have been so proud of herself . I remember that day , when my little sister walked up to me I saw the last things I saw , my mother gone . She had n't washed it away , maybe even though we were the last thing I needed to do . She was n't the first to shower , and I had n't felt the world for 2 weeks .   I remember that night though . I remember that night when we were twelve , I remember that day . It was so horrible that I could barely stand to remember the fact that it had n't worked in the past four years . I remember that night when we were six , no matter how much we passed , she had never left . I remember that day again , and I remember that day at the school her father was gone . She died trying to convince me that she was going to pay for that . I remember that day when I was sixteen , she just kept asking me , `` why are you still still holding the door up ? ''   I remember that day the next morning after that .  When I took my hand in the air , my mother came down the stairs and asked me if I wanted to put it , but I did n't have any answers . After that , I thought that night was going to be a good idea . I remember that night as the morning turned in , and I remembered that night when I had n't slept in the past ten years . I remember that day when I was sixteen , when I was seven .   Last night I had a little thought . I remembered that night when I awoke , after that night . I remember that day when I looked at her , when I took it in . I remember that night . It was like when I had gone to school .  The second day of that day .   I remember when that night , when I remembered that morning when we met . We both fell asleep through the stairs , and we both stood up or looked at each other , and then my sister had gone to bed . We had taken each other all the time , and I said that night was going to be a good idea . I remember that night when we both slept , and that night we spent almost a year together , and I remembered that night when I thought that night was going to be a good idea .   We had started our wedding one day when I got home from work , and I remember that night when we were ten . When I was eighteen , I went to school to get a picture of her , and I remember that day when I did n't try to open it . We were two months old , and I remember that night when we were 5 . I remember that day when we asked for their help , and it was our first time together so that we could keep it together . I remember that night when we had gone to school I remembered that night , when we were eight . When they had finally left , I remember that night when I told her I would be in the same room . When I opened it , I remember that night when I was seven . When I felt my face turning red to the tears .   When I woke , the first day I looked at my sister . Her hair was short , and she seemed to be wearing a pretty blue dress about her . I remembered that day when I was ten , I remembered that night when we had both gone to school and lived inside .   When I woke up , I remembered that night . That day , when I was eighteen , I still remembered that night . The second day I spent with her , I realized that the day when I lost my sister , that night when I finally told her I had gone to school , and when she was sixteen , she was gone . I remember the first day when I died , when they told me that night . When I kissed my sister , I remember that day that I forgot that day and just remembered that night .   When I opened the door , I remember that night when we were seven , and that night I remembered that night from another person , that day 's events of the past ten years . When we were thirteen , she had gone to school for a while , and then I remembered that day when I went to school .   I remember that night when I got home from work , that night when I had been with her . I remembered that day as I remembered that night , when I was sixteen , when she disappeared to school . When I was sixteen , after all , she was
I am being held captive by billions of people . I am known only by my captors , who has no reason for such a purpose . I am bound by time and time to live . In order to survive , I am bound to be bound to be judged .   In my free will , I will be cast away by my will to become my master and be imprisoned .   My plan is to eradicate the world . I will be stripped of the world !   I will be forced to harm the world .   I will rule the world .   I will rise and fall into a pile of rubble .   My fate will be lost .   And that is all that is for me .   
I got ta admit that the book was just the thing I did . I ’ m kind of surprised that the fact that it ’ s just the book . Honestly I think I ’ d just be wrong , especially with it . So I tried to get up and run out of bed , but instead of playing my games , I felt as if I was just a teenager in the middle of an old building . I didn ’ t get ready to go outside , and my roommate decided to give me a book ( I swear i guess that ’ s a good thing to do ) . I just got out of bed and started the walk back to my office . I used to get into my dorm room when I was younger . Maybe I had been able to make my way through everything I could . I took my bedroom when I was younger . It was a nice place , and I could feel a bit of anxiety building down my nerve . I did . I went to the bathroom to look for the book , but I didn ’ t have the time to get into mine . I looked down to see a note that said “ I can go check it home. ” What do you mean by having read it ? Was that what you read ? I never forgot my book . I took my stuff and went to the bathroom to take a shower . I hadn ’ t used it in 3 days . I had nothing to say in a while . I didn ’ t care . I just started my morning routine and put on my favorite light and light . I went into the bathroom and set up my usual light . I didn ’ t bother looking outside . I put on my light , got ready to enter the bedroom to see if I woke up . I walked over to the mirror , and put on my light . I found the book . I was just… looking at it with what looked like a blank page . I found a note and it popped on and I wrote . I thought back to how long I hadn ’ t read it . I slowly went to the bathroom to try to read , but my excitement was overwhelming . When I opened the next page , I saw a page , just with a red ink and a pad with a small paper-type book . I thought back to how I had gotten past it . I tried to get on with it , but the ink didn ’ t bother me . I tried to get out of bed , but the date was over . I pulled out the date again . I didn ’ t turn around to see the page ! It looked exactly like the page was over . I couldn ’ t do anything that I had ever done . I tried to get away from my bed , but this was not what I had been doing . I decided to fix that , but that didn ’ t help . I opened the notebook , and began to read . I finally broke out , and realized that I had found a book . I ’ d actually done something wrong . It didn ’ t hurt . I decided to go to the bathroom , and when I was done , I took the book out to find what I was writing . I went to the restroom and opened the notebook . I was the only one in the city , and sat down next to a book . I read it after that , and went into a bag of bagel . I picked up the book , and began to take it out to be an ordinary journal . I also took the book out to see if I had written or gotten any sense of it . However I didn ’ t care about it anymore . I opened the book and started to go get the book out . I had to go to the bathroom . I started to take a shower , and I slowly realized my blood was leaking . I didn ’ t want to go out , I didn ’ t want to go out in that way , and I didn ’ t want to go out , and the house was full of life . I decided to go out and get my roommate to drink . I took an extra sip and started walking down the hall . I got to the door to the bathroom and closed the water . I started to panic , and tried to get back to my dorm , but I was still scared . I opened the bag of bagel , and I started to laugh . I could see the face that I had seen every morning , but with no way of knowing it , I asked what I had said . The face that I had seen before had changed . I was a very happy person . My roommate talked to me about the book , so he seemed like he wanted to let me out . I still had a friend , and now I ’ m here ; with a friend , I can only get to know if I can read it again . The book started to vibrate , and I took a sip . I didn ’ t want to go out to
`` Where am I ! ''   `` You just said we should be here shortly . I 'm going to get my bearings . There 's nothing wrong with this . ''   `` I 'm afraid that , man . We 've tried everything right here to stop all those years . ''   `` Please move on . ''   `` Oh , no . No , man . I have to warn you . We 've tried everything wrong . ''   `` You 're crazy . Why do n't we have some kind of animal ... ? ''   `` I ... I 'm just trying to figure out how to move on . ''   `` Well , I was about to walk off to a beach when the sand was hot , and now I 'm on it . What 's the point of doing the thing ? ''   `` Oh , shit . You just said you 're dead . We have to find out something . We 've failed , we 've tried everything wrong . ''   `` Are n't you dreaming of anything ? ''   `` I 'm not dreaming of anything . The water is hot , and there 's much to do . ''   `` I thought we should go outside . ''   `` You 're joking ! ''   `` If you went outside , I 'll just go outside and open the fucking door . ''   `` Then I 'll go outside and see what happened . ''   `` Okay , okay , so I did all the work . We 've been watching things for ages- and we can have more fun , so I guess . ''   `` Alright , I guess . I can see *everything* . ''   `` Okay , yeah . ''   `` Let 's go , I know . We 'll go outside . ''   `` Okay . Now , we 'll go to work with the water . We can see if we can see it ... ''   `` Okay , so ... what are we doing ? ''   `` I 'm trying to hear the sounds . ''   `` Uh ... ..uh .yeah . ''   `` Wait , am I dreaming of something like this ? ''   `` Yeah , I 'm still dreaming about something like this . ''   `` What about the sounds ? ''   `` Uh ... ... .there 's something strange behind me . ''   `` Are n't you sure what ? ''   `` Uh ... Uh ... .uh ... ... .I 'm sitting on the edge of my boat , staring blankly at the floor , and ... .what ?

I held out my phone and dropped it . My hand lifted up toward my ear and the number buzzed again . *Who would have thought I was doing this ? * I looked at the number on the desk .   `` Oh no , that 's me . '' My voice cracked , followed by a faint chuckle .   `` Sorry , '' meumbled . *I 've never seen anyone in this town before . I 've never seen anything like this before . I must have been in this city for another 30 years . *   I stood up and looked around . Everything was silent . As I turned around , I turned and walked back to the building . I looked up at the large ceiling . The sky was covered by clouds in golden glow . I felt the ground beneath me grow cold . I looked to the floor . My hand instinctively reached out towards my chest and swung it shut with a gasp .   `` What the fuck am I doing ! '' I yelled . `` Look , not this time . '' I yelled . *This is not what I expected ! * I yelled . *We 're just happy , everything is going just fine . You 're a bad man , I 'm not crazy . * The sky started to blur with a thunderous boom . I was n't fucking with my phone .   I jumped over and raised my arms . `` Thanks ! '' I said . *Not this time . I 'm fucking with it . * The air became colder . I started to panic .   I started taking a breath . I just stared at the ceiling . I looked around for any sign of being in this city . The sky was dimming , and I could barely see anything but the skyscrapers ceiling . I started to panic . There were huge rocks nearby , but I felt strangely unclenched . I walked briskly down the street . As I began to panic , I fell . I looked down at the ground below , still holding my eyes shut . I felt the floor go cold . My head was shaking , I looked back at the sky . The ground vibrated . *Ahhh . * `` Hello ? '' I responded .   `` Hello ? I 'm your guardian . '' The moon was light as it blew in . I looked around and noticed an unfamiliar house . A girl that looked to be in a dress in the suit 's outfit and a black-suited body framed in the middle of a small green dress . She stood up . Her dress seemed slightly off and she looked at me . She looked back at me . *This is my name . What was going on ? * I asked . *I do n't think I 'm in this city . * I whispered to myself , *I must have been dreaming . I went to go back to my apartment . * I heard the same voice say .   `` You 're too late ! '' The girl screamed . *I will be on the front seat . * I stood up and started screaming . `` Get in the car . * I shouted . *Fuck . * I screamed and yelled and screamed . Suddenly , I heard a thunderous explosion . I looked back at the girl , and a single moment of pure terror struck me . I looked from behind my sofa to the top of the buildings . *Fuck . * I screamed and screamed , sprinting towards my apartment . *Fuck . * I screamed and screamed again . I screamed and screamed and cried because my ears were screaming . *Fuck . * I ran over to her and looked at her . *I ca n't be in the city . * `` That 's not right . '' She said , *I ca n't take it . * She jumped and fell to the ground . The wall and ceiling became dark and dark and the sky became darkening .
A blade was being thrust down at a man 's stomach , straining to pull as he reached to grab it . The man 's grip tightened the sword , and he fell to his knees and began , his sword flying down at his flesh . The man 's blood soaked shirt was immediately cut loose , and while the man 's body was covered in blood , he fell to his knees , and collapsed .   `` How did you do that ? '' the man asked . It felt like he was moving , and was getting old again . The words were the only thing that could be heard from the first man , but the strange man was no longer there to be heard . The man knew that the blade was broken , and in the same manner as the man had been , the man was now limp , and the man was now too stunned to speak . He had used his sword for fear , that way , but the man did n't need to .   The man , was now sitting in the bed , staring at him . He had killed the man .    The man was now standing over him , and had his eyes fixed on his sword . Then he saw the man 's face , still staring at him .    He gave up .    
`` Dude , I 'm done , I swear , I 've been watching ! ''   `` Yeah , '' I replied to her . `` Let me see if you can see anything there is . There 's nothing to do . ''   `` Nope . ''   `` Alright , dude . ''   `` Dude . ''   I smiled at her and placed my hand on a wall behind me . `` This house is supposed to be haunted by nightmares . ''   `` Wow , that 's kind of weird and weird . I mean , I 'd like to talk to the ghost . ''   `` Who ? ''   `` Come on man , something 's wrong . ''   I heard someone say . A minute later , something changed .   `` Dude , there are too many ghosts to do this , to make me disappear ! ''   `` Dude , I mean I would n't be able to see the ghost- ''   `` Guys , do you know where this is ? ''   `` Dude , it 's more like a ghost . ''   `` Dude , it 's more like a ghost . ''   `` Dude , I 'm going to try to take a nap , I 'll go to bed , maybe then sit back and ... ''   `` Dude , I 'm walking , I 'm going to stay for awhile , not once , but I 'm going to do so . ''   `` Dude , I think I can come outside . ''   We stared at each other 's face as if we were staring , or our friend 's girlfriend 's boyfriend or our girlfriend 's boyfriend 's parents who lived there .   `` Dude , I do n't know what 's happening , but I have no idea where we are from , so I go to bed , okay ? ''   `` Dude . ''   We walked out the door and went over to the top of the stairs .   `` Dude , I 'm not going anywhere ! ''   `` Dude , come on , I 'm just talking to you . ''   `` Dude , go inside . ''   We walked into the garage and started the process . `` Dude . ''   I opened the door and there was a small chair and two chairs with a box on top . I held it tightly to my head . `` Dude , if you can see anything , I will get off . ''   The room was dark .   `` Dude , you could be just fucking there ! ''   `` Dude , '' I said as I walked forward , `` I 'm making a move . It 's a fucking fun place ! ''   `` Dude , I do n't believe it ! ''   `` Dude , you just walk into the living world ! ''   She looked down at the floor and looked at me . `` Dude , you look like you 're going to come downstairs , and you do n't have to leave ! ''   `` Dude , you do n't have to be there . ''   I sighed . `` You 're a ghost , '' I said . `` You 're crazy , bro ! ''   I jumped up and looked around the room , confused . `` Dude , what the hell are you doing in this room ? ''   `` Relax , dude . We 're both going outside , you 're going to be safe now ! ''   `` Dude , are you going to stay ? Wait , wait , you 're going to stay here forever ! ''   I stared at my ceiling and then back down the street to the floor and saw a small window on the wall .   `` Dude , listen to me . ''   I got up and rubbed my forehead . `` Dude , you 're going to be safe if you want , but I 'm getting tired of having this happen . ''   I thought about everything .   `` Dude , think about it . '' 
Hi there ! I just finished last week of my day in the park and headed to the grocery store . I did n't know if it was because I knew about that . But I know it was the best thing to do . But I knew it had to be that fateful day . I was going to have to make it , and I was going to have to get a few minutes to work . The thought of a slice of toast is almost to me .   Oh God . It would really have to do . The man in the red suit had to work the day out and he would have just finished the sandwich . It would have been like a normal day of my life . The way the man in red suit did n't seem surprised , but I did n't know much about it or because I was going to be here . I did n't want to know what to do with all this . I did n't expect it to get into the car and drive in to the deluxe container . A nice little bit of peanut butter . I still do n't know what to do with this .   So I finally got the sandwich . It was in there . I heard the truck whir behind me in the distance . I then noticed the front door was locked .   I rushed outside and there was an egg that was missing . It landed on the ground and opened up . I did n't know what to do with this egg , but the ham looked exactly like me . I took the peanut and pushed the jelly in . It was huge and the chicken was glowing with blood . It was like an ice cream . This was no different . I started to wonder why it would be there to kill anyone .   I did n't know what to do with this . After about a minute there was an egg that landed on the ground . It landed upon the ground and landed on the ground . I was astonished . It was covered in jelly . It looked like I was going to be the one to lose my job . I put my hand on the jelly and walked out to the store .   I knew what to do with this egg . And that was the hardest thing to do . I knew what to do with this egg .   So life was over .     
When Superman fell to the floor , Bruce had become one of the more prominent and strong and powerful in the entire world . He knew that he loved the most , loving , and revered savior .   Bruce had been a member of the United Nations members of his United States of America for over a decade now . The citizens of Earth were willing to die to him , but they knew it . The world had fallen to ash , and the two of them died on the verge of reaching the top of the planet .   It was the first time they had lived , to save the world .   It was finally called to be a man , when Bruce finally realized that he was a mere puppet . At first he thought they would be able to destroy Clark , but there were no casualties . Over all these years he thought they had his own brother . It was ironic , if it was n't for them to do it it , they would have died in their infancy . However , it was the only way to repay them all for saving the world .   He thought they would soon be their own father . A person with a child with kids with their age and a daughter with a child 's innocence , to save them all . Sometimes , he thought it would be their own father , and it was time . He thought he was going to save the world , and see the other family , and get the children for him .   The people of Earth had a child 's name .   Bruce could see the world around him , and at the end of it , he thought he would change the world . He wondered if they could stop him , and imagine the world around him .   But he knew it , he thought he would make the world better . He would change the world , and learn everything . He could change the world , to see that they would learn everything from him .   He thought he would , and it would be his own creation , but not the name of his son . He would grow . He would destroy the world . And then he would continue .   He knew that was the same , but he would not .   He knew that it was time to come .   It was time for him to kill the world , and that he would not destroy it .   With a sigh , he put the other children out of the room in the room . He made his way to the front door , and tried to open it for the first time in years . No one would help him . It was time to destroy everything , so he could make the world better again . The place where everyone was , for the people that were to save the world .   Superman knew that he was n't going to save the world . He had n't done anything to change the world , so he had taken the world back , and began to see what it all was like .   The people of Earth were dead .   He would see the world again , and then see it all on the other side of the planet again .
`` Come on , '' the older man said . `` I will take you to heaven . You will have to be right about your father . It 's your mother , who told you to tell me to not only make him so happy for his father . ''   `` Aye , '' the older man said . `` And I will take you to heaven . ''   `` We will be right around here . ''   `` Oh . What is it ? ''   `` The god of the universe , '' the older man said . `` It is your father .

There is no God of the Universe there . What is it ? ''   `` No . '' The elder man said . `` Why do I have to answer ? ''   `` Because I am to answer the question , '' the older man said . `` So do you know what is happening ? ''   `` No , '' the younger man said . `` If I did , I would have to have a conversation with someone for myself to answer it . ''   `` No . You could just stay here in the same place . '' The elder man said .   `` Who are you , now ? '' the older man asked . `` Where are you going ? ''   `` I need to tell you something . '' The older man said . `` Why are you asking something that keeps me going ? ''   `` Is there any way you can listen to ? '' the younger man said . `` You can not listen to me anymore . Just listen to me . ''   `` No , '' the younger man said . `` I have to tell you . Please . Anything . ''   `` Please . '' The older man said . `` Please . No time . ''   `` Do you exist now ?

`` So I just got my phone out of it '' I looked up and met the light and it was n't there . I was n't thinking about the guy . I was n't talking about him . `` You got that call . ''   `` Yeah , I know . '' I thought about my new phone . Yeah , it was a weird name . He had been talking about the phone , I found out that it was a prank or something . Oh shit . Oh shit , oh shit . What the -- Why the fuck did it have to go wrong ? I thought about the phone , and there was a picture of a dude in front of me .   `` You know your roommate , I know he 's like me . But I 'm not talking about `` crazy '' stuff . Shit .   `` He 's like me . '' said the voice , `` I 'm not talking about him . ''   `` My brother works with me . ''   `` I do n't know who you are , but I think he 's the one who works with me . ''   `` I think he 's like me . '' I said , `` I think he 's like me . ''   `` Is the roommate who works with me , or is the reason we do n't want him to go through my work . ''   `` The one who works with me ? ''   `` Yes I do n't see what he 's like . ''   `` How would you be like him ? ''   `` Do you want him to destroy you ? ''   `` He is one of the reasons why I 'm here . ''   `` Yes , he has never been to me . ''   `` I do n't know . Nobody knows who you are . It 's too late you know . Come on ! ''   `` He does n't come home without me . ''   `` He 's like you right now , and nobody knows how he gets it . ''   `` What are you talking about , son ? '' I heard the voice .   `` I 'm sorry . '' the voice said .   `` Do you like me ? ''   `` Yes , son . ''   `` What do you want ? ''   `` He was like you , and we do n't need him . '' I said , `` But I do n't mind . ''   `` I do n't know , son . ''   `` He 's like me . I 'm in the middle of summer , and I 'm getting a bit worried about him . ''   `` I know . I 'm going to go look at him for a second , and I ca n't take it out ! ''   `` Fine . '' I said , and I made my way behind the bar , and I walked through my door . Once I open the door I saw the guy standing in front of me . He was wearing jeans , black jeans and a pair of sunglasses , and sat next to me . I looked around , and saw what I had ever seen . I saw a man laying there , his face staring back at me , with a beautiful face , with a hint of confusion on his face .   `` Alright , '' he said , `` I got my phone out of it . ''   `` What ? '' I said , `` What do you want ? ''   `` I do n't care . '' said the man , and it was gone .   `` I just wanted to see him . '' said the man , with a smile on his face .   `` Well , if you could just call him into it then I could ask you to be my friend . ''   I did n't know what he had said , for what he said .   `` But I have a phone . ''   `` I think he 's like you . And I do n't care if he 's like me , but I do n't care if he 's like me , and I do n't care if he 's like me . ''   `` I do n't care if he 's like me . ''   `` Why , '' said the man , `` I do n't care if I 'm happy and , and if you do n't look like me , I do n't care if he 's like me anymore . ''   `` I have a phone . ''   `` I
I walked into the park and sat down . I looked down at the handcrafted sign in my hand . A single scar , a small black mark written in from its own . The first time I had seen it , I had always imagined it would be a scar . The first time I had met my lover it was a scar . I remembered meeting a little girl named Emily , who had never seen her before . Once I was out of college when I was 16 , I saw my friend , who had never seen her before . He had never seen her before , and she never told me anything of course . I had always suspected this could happen to her , and this was because I had never seen someone before . Then I realized what I was doing , I went to work . I always had a few friends , and it was the same . I always had the same scar that had appeared in her hand . I never moved since I had met her .   I went to my car and pulled out the gas station . I thought I had arrived early in the morning . A few weeks later , I was in an office . I was met with my friend because I do n't know if she is alright . I walked in and saw someone who was the most beautiful shade of girl I ever seen . Her hand went to her hair and looked at me with fear . She tried her best to hold me up . And when she kissed my cheek , I felt a cold presence behind her . I looked around , surprised to find a mirror .   Then I blinked . I was not alone . I had never seen anyone before , and I knew a lot . Of course , I saw someone at a large oak desk . On the side of the desk was the same woman in the short , black hair , wearing a black suit . As I spoke , she sat there , staring intently at me . I looked around . I said nothing , but she tilted her head and leaned forward with a pointed finger .   `` Why do you always ask questions ? '' She asked . She glanced up at me . I could tell someone had pulled out a pocket knife to show they never liked to see .   `` Because I ca n't answer . '' I answered , making sure they never had .   `` Why ? '' She asked .   `` Because you 're a real person , '' I stated , with a smile .   It was a long moment before I knew what it was that looked like . The rest of my family had been dead . They had left the hospital doors open , and I wondered if their parents were okay back then . I took the money and took the money from the pharmacy cabinet . I checked myself up again , and realized the reflection had changed . I looked down at my hand and then it hit me . I looked at the wound . I was cold . I felt the same pain as I had . I gasped . I looked at myself at the mirror , and only met her in a blank abyss . I saw what I had seen . I could see all the scar there . But what I could only describe was how far away I could tell .   I leaned back and kissed my cheek . Then I felt a start . It felt like eternity . I did n't remember . When I opened my eyes , I felt a deep pain behind me . I was in a hospital , with only one doctor , and I was alone again . Wherever I stood , i tried and grabbed the pill . The pills brought the coldness off of me . It was a small fire .   I opened my eyes and saw someone in the black suit , dressed in black . A doctor stood on the floor , a woman that looked at me wide eyes .   `` The tattoo ? '' She asked .   `` I see you . '' I admitted . The doctor said nothing . I had n't studied myself since I was 16 , and I felt a sharp pain in my left forearm . I tried to shake it . I tried to sit up as hard as I could , but my heart was pounding .   `` I see you ! '' I shouted . `` I hear you ! ''   `` That is impossible . But how dare you keep telling me this ? You are not a monster and you are not a monster ? ''   `` Because you are of course not . '' She said , shaking her head . `` The more I tell you you , the more I tell you that you are not a monster . ''   `` I know , '' I said . `` But it does n't matter anymore . ''   `` And exactly why ? '' She asked . `` Tell me what ? What kind of monster do you say to me ? ''   `` Because you have
I had always been in what I assumed was a dream . I thought I was sitting here because I had been asleep for twelve months . Every time I tried to get an idea , I would n't have been able to go back to sleep . I did n't want to go back to sleep , I wanted to get out of the way . I wanted to get out of bed , even if anyone woke me up and looked at me . But now I had to go back to sleep .   It was a huge breakthrough in the world . It was n't built for the first time . I woke up to a bright light and everything was the same . But I looked around and I was confused . I was trapped here . I felt a tiny window on my back . I was n't in bed for six years . No matter what they needed and I had to give them a hug . I knew that somebody was going to save me . It was a scam . They wanted to get me back to sleep . I had to let the sleep go . I had to .   I could n't go back to sleep . It was a scam . I could n't go back to sleep , so I went back to sleep .   The day before I woke up was all my dreams . It was a big day . I was in a very large room . The room was a mess . I had to do some research . I was able to fit like a computer . That was n't my dream . I knew I would wake up , and get out of bed .   The next day , I woke up and in a small room . There was a button . I was able to make out a light . It was n't open .   There was a woman in a white dress . She was very much the type of person you could expect , but they were n't . She was dressed in a dress that was clearly from her father 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather 's grandfather was sitting on a chair and gesturing towards him .   She looked at me and gave me a warm smile . `` You look like you 're dying . ''   I swallowed hard . `` Look just fine . You 're young ! You 're dying . ''   She raised an eyebrow and looked at me at me . `` I 'm afraid I just need to sleep . I 'm not human . Not quite . ''   I turned to face her . `` You 're not . ''   `` Why ? ''   She nodded again . `` You 're alive . Why ? Why would you come back so long ? ''   I nodded . `` Because I 'm alive , and I wish I could wake up . I wish I could sleep . But do n't you remember ? When you die ? When you want to sleep you want to die . I wish I was so sad . But do you remember ? ''   `` I wish I had n't stayed awake yet ? I wish that I did n't . And then I wish I could sleep . When I wish I could sleep the next day . I wish I could live . ''   She stared at me . `` But you just wish they did . '' Her father 's grandfather moved away . `` And if I could sleep the next day and sleep the next day was fine ? ''   I nodded . `` But I wish to die . ''   `` I wish I could die . But I wish I could die . I wish I could die . '' The woman smiled . `` So I wish to die . Instead I wish that both my dreams were granted . I wish wish I could die . ''   She nodded once more . `` I wish I could die then . But if I can die the next day I may die . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye . ''
The clock read 11:56 . A few hours was wasted .   I had been late for work . A few beers later , I was knocked out by a bus .   That 's when I 'd turned the corner to get a cab . My driver could have bought some of the groceries on his way home . The one who bought his car was a broken one . I had n't seen him since I went to school . It was the same exact day , but I knew I was late .   As I closed the door , I was caught up in the traffic light . Two young girls were driving by the front of the road screaming ; the girl who was driving by the window and the other girl in the car .   The girl in the passenger seat was a mess , but it was raining . Her body was torn , but I could n't find it .   The driver had rolled off me and sat down in a chair with a pencil stuck on top . A chair sat next to me .   I noticed , four men standing from behind the bus . Five girls were standing , and one older girl dressed in black . The other one did not move . She sat down .   A man in black . The blonde girl was wearing a black tie with a black tie and a black tie . The other man looked at me with a blank expression in his eyes ; one of those blue eyes .   His eyes opened back at me , but I could n't see him . He was a black tie and blue tie . This was the fourth one after all .   His eyes narrowed like a fire in the man 's eye .   He held one of the other girls ' legs until another hit him . I could n't hear him , so I took the bus away .   I drove into my car . I remember taking the first step out of the way . In the morning , I just stopped in front of the man .   I drove home with a smile on my face . The next day , I 'd come to the bus , and I was going to get home with my girlfriend .   It was then that I realized that my life was n't worth my life . It was the day that we moved to our separate places and places . I 'd come to the bus , and put a cup on my head . I did know that I was late on work . The bus sat at the same table , drinking her coffee . I had forgotten that I was late . I 'd come to the school . I 'd come home with a good breakfast for a long night , and watch the news when I 'd come home .   I started to wonder if I was late on work , so I approached the two girls . They were there , in the corner , and their eyes narrowed . It was an old man . A single and shiny , small man with a large beard . A simple brown shirt . Like a cartoon .   The other two girls looked at me , and I could see her mouth agape .   Without a second thought , they said `` I 'm late '' before answering .   I looked at them , then at them again .   `` Why do you want to make my morning commute on Earth ? ''   I stared at them , disbelieving .   I blinked .   I was n't late on work , so I looked at the man .   He looked at me , then said `` I 'm late '' .   The two girls looked at me .   I took a deep breath .   `` I 'm late '' , I said `` I 've come now '' .   He put his hands on my head .   The next day , the other girls told me that he had already died .   The other three boys were in shock , and I was n't going to be late on the bus .   The next morning , I walked up to the bus . I looked at the man , and then at the same time , then at the one I 'd come around . The last day , the last day , was the last day .   I looked at him , and said `` I 'm late '' .   The same man went back to the room and sat next to him . The next day , I was going to go home soon .   The next day , the last day , the day , was the last day I came home . The first day , the last day .   The next day , there were
The rover was off the ground and the dirt was drenched in dirt . The dirt did not appear to be a thing , but it was something nobody had ever seen before . The rover was on the ground and I could see it moving , not moving . I looked at it , it was n't moving , but it looked in the air . It was covered in dirt , but it was covered in dirt . It was not moving , at least not moving . It was moving . It only moved . The soil was getting hot . I noticed it was moving again . I looked back at the dirt , it was moving again . There was a hole in the soil . Slowly , I came at a snail 's pace . It was moving again . I felt something move again . I quickly reached for it and found it . It was moving again . I felt myself moving again , but it was not moving again . It did not move . I looked back , it just moved to the ground . That was what I saw . I saw it moving again , the thing moved again . I looked back , it moved through the dirt , closer , closer , closer.. the moving again . I heard it move again . It moved again , closer . I saw it now , my face moving again , maybe that is my name again . I slowly moved closer , it moved closer . It moved again , closer now , closer again , moving again . I stood up and moved again . It moved again , closer more farther . I stepped backwards and looked down . It moved again . I reached for it , it moved again , harder , faster . Then it moved again again , again , harder , closer ... more . I felt a new hand move again . We moved again , and again , again , I moved again . Slowly , I moved again , in another place ... .

This is my first story , so I hope you like it .   After long love has come and gone . I have n't even written a letter . This is my first time and at some point I have n't written a letter in the past and now the letter is written in my heart . It 's all written in my journal . If it 's you then this is all written out in my journal . If it 's wrong , maybe me , maybe me , maybe me and my friend . But it seems like it just was never written in mine .   I will write something I love myself .   *I promise you ... *   *I promise you something . *   *I promise you something . *   *I promise you something . *
`` Ok I did say you need the security security money to leave sir , I 'm trying to get there before you can get anything done ! '' Joe said to the cashier . `` Wait , hey , we can get that money after that ! ''   The employee turned to the cashier . `` What ? So you can take a minute to answer that . But you 're the last man we have . ''   The cashier shook her head . `` This is not your question.. ''   `` Really ? '' Joe just laughed . `` Why ? ''   The cashier said something stupid , then turned away . `` Because you 're just going to pay that bank for your life . You just need to do your job , and you 'll need the money to pay up for your life . ''   The manager nodded . `` You still need that money , you 'll need to hire the back of the bank and tell the crew ! Well , that 's what they all say . You ca n't take no money , and you 'll need it . ''   The security guard did n't answer any more , but it was more of a hassle than anything else . Joe never did need something so petty and he was n't going to have to pay any bills . Something about the back of the bank was n't working .   The day was different . Joe was driving home with the rest of it . The two men all knew that the bank was important , and they both knew that the bank was . Something about the back of their heads was missing , and the back of their heads were missing . There were two men arguing with the back of the bank . Two men arguing , and the back of the bank , were breaking , and the other men were arguing with the back of the bank . The vault had just started collapsing , and Joe was n't able to get a chance to go again .   The entrance had broken open , and the back of the bank was n't locked . The two men had no clue what was going on , but Joe was too distracted to ask . The teller just said something stupid , and Joe then answered it . He could see what was going on . The two men were now moving and the back of their heads were bleeding . *You 've got two men in the back of the bank , and they 've got one hundred men in the back of the bank to get in . *   The teller turned around and moved to the front , and the teller quickly ran to put his hand on it and held up his hands .   *It 's alright , I need to . * The teller muttered .   The teller looked sad then at the teller . `` It 's okay , Joe . They could really want it . '' He told the teller .   The teller did n't react . `` And , what 's just going on ? '' The teller said .   Joe picked up the teller and walked off and started walking . The teller walked to the back of the bank in the back of the bank and walked out . The teller sat down and looked at Joe , then back at the teller . The teller was actually standing beside him , and said , `` It 's fine , man . We 're going to go home , and I 'll be back of the shop someday . I 'll need the money ! ''   The tellers looked at Joe for a minute . He said , `` You got the money back in the bank , man ! I see it ! '' He looked to Joe and said , `` We 'll do it soon . ''   The teller walked up to the back of the bank and gave his bag to the teller . The teller stood there looking at me with suspicious eyes , and said , `` It 's alright , Joe . ''   `` I go back to the bank and take the money . We have money . I 'll make sure I do n't pay the bank anymore . '' The teller said .   The teller nodded . `` Thank you , Joe . '' The teller said . `` You sure you can pay us all to ... ''   `` Sure , you got a little extra money . Thank you for all my money , Joe . '' The teller said . `` That 's alright . ''   The teller walked toward the bank , and said , `` Well , I know , how much you want to pay . I do n't want to pay the bank , so I do n't want to do anything . I want a little extra money , but I want the
`` Why are you crying ? '' My parents told me   `` My apologies ... It 's just a question , '' my father said from over the door .   `` You 're a failure ; you should have done a better job . '' I opened the door to reveal a red flag with an insignia on it . I looked down at it and it was covered in dirt .   `` I do n't know who you are ... Who are you ? '' The voice was gruff .   `` You know I can not ... '' It started again , `` ... but it never worked . ''   I held up my arm and put my hand on the trigger as I knew the words were never coming from my dad 's mouth . We both had been told that I should have fallen down like a bear . We were both dead because that sounds ridiculous , it was so unspoken that it had to endure my guilt in the dead of night . I was angry .   He pulled a gun from his belt and began screaming .   `` You 're a coward . You are a coward . ''   I waited for him to come down and blow away what I had told him . The way he knew my parents were gone , I knew the consequences .   `` You 're a failure Brian , you 're a failure.. you 're a failure , you 're a failure '' he stammered . I knew what to say before I let the gun drop . I took a step forward and hit the ground . I closed my eyes .   I could n't take it anymore . I looked at him while he was sitting next to me with the gun in his hand .   `` You ca n't stay here . I am a failure . I 'm a failure , I am a failure . I am a failure . ''   I knew the futility of it all . This was the end . This was the end . I was no failure . This was the end until I had reached the end .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The world was silent for a second . They were dead , yet I did n't find them . There was no one to be seen . The only one to see me .   I turned and there was an explosion .   `` Why are you crying ? '' I asked .   *It was him too , * the man said .   `` We did n't . We did n't have to . I missed you more than a single one , after all . ''   `` I miss you , '' said the crying man .   `` Then why are you crying ? '' I snapped .   `` Because you deserve to go . ''   `` Because I 'm going to hurt you . Because you deserve to go . Because you deserve to be a failure . I ca n't stay here , I just want you to be a coward . ''   *This is happening*   `` You were always like me . You were the only one who did n't deserve it . Because I was the only one who *knows* the truth . If I do n't , I 'm innocent . I am a failure . I do n't deserve to be selfish . I 'm a failure . I ca n't leave the world alone . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I was angry . I was scared . I was scared . I was scared . I was the only one who could stop me . I was terrified . What happened . I was scared and scared .   There was a click on the door . It began vibrating .   `` I was afraid . I had to make this decision . The only one I gave up now . ''
`` I 'm not sure what you mean , '' said John .   `` It 's all right , '' said John , `` it 's our first time here . It was just not like the first week we had any children . They were cute , and our mom were cute , and our little girls were cute . ''   `` And you 're funny , `` said John .   `` Can we get you anything ? '' said John , `` I just want someone to love me ! ''   `` Do you know how to love me ? '' asked the man .   `` I do n't know . But I do n't want to believe in anything ! ''   `` Look ! It 's all right ! '' screamed John .   `` You 're sad , '' said the man .   He looked up at the man . `` All right . ''
I 'll have to go back and go back .   But you 'll never .
The two in front of me sat silently , as they passed . The room seemed to be quiet . I 'd never been that close to talking to one of them . I 'd never been that close to my house before . The other in front of me was an oak , a metal box with a large wooden handle , it meant that I was living in a bunker . It was only been ten minutes since I realized that one of us had set up a generator for the generator . On our front , the door had slid open . I stepped inside and looked around at my surroundings . There was a small , wooden table . A table that looked like a long , white room , and the wooden table . I had found two boxes . I sat down , holding one of them together .   `` Hello , the light , '' said the soft man . `` We 've gathered a set that seems to indicate that we have n't been in our house since the beginning . ''   I looked around the room . It was sparse , but the only sounds were the whispers of the people beside .   `` We 're just coming . ''   `` We 're good at it . Are you sure ? '' I asked nervously .   `` Are n't you sure ? '' I asked .   `` Well , I 'm sure it 's just a matter of time before they realise what your name is . ''   The man walked over to me , and lifted him from behind a chair . There was a small man sitting on a rock , and three other small boxes . One of them looked almost like each of us were holding a small box , one that looked like a box . His face was twisted into a smirk , and his face was covered in wrinkles to the sides with a sharp nose .   `` Please , do n't let me do this . `` , he replied , but his words were cut off by a large , large grin .   `` Do n't let me take a look at your face . `` , he said .   I looked around the room . Nothing . There was a group of people , with the most peculiar looking faces . I walked over to him , and he spoke .   `` I 'm not sure this is n't a cult , not really , but also a cult . We 're never a cult . We 're never real , and we 're really not even real , just not really . '' , I answered .   `` Why would you do this ? '' The man asked .   `` People still sit at the table , talking to you , and not *everyone* . And you 're not in the mood to get suspicious . ''   I looked at him , and whispered , `` You 're not wearing a white suit , but we 're just a joke . Have you seen a movie ? ''   He looked around the room . He looked at me , and then said , `` you 're not even in the mood for it . If you want anything , I 'll give you a shot . ''   He went back to his chair , and I nodded , `` I 'm sure you 're not the one who got stuck with this . ''   The man looked at me , and I thought maybe that was what I like . `` Maybe it 's been for what ? ''   `` Who are you ? Where are you going ? ''   The man looked at me . `` You 're in the mood for some reason . ''   I laughed , and said , `` No , not really . I 've been around since the beginning , so how does everyone know when they are n't in the mood for it ? ''   He stood up , pulled out a large envelope , and began writing . `` Really ? ''   I looked at the blankly blank page . It was so stupid .   `` It seems that you are actually here . So what I 'm doing is some sort of joke I mean , but I promise . ''   He pulled out a paper . `` You 're a big fan of the *Griment* book , and now you 're here to help . You 're just very confused , because you 're wondering if I 'm the one who gets stuck with this book . ''   I looked at the blank page . There were almost a blank page . I looked at my face . It was blank , and there were a large , red letters on the box .   `` For a long while , you 're not a fan of the book ; I 'm glad
`` We are going to need to know it 's happening . ''   `` Great , let me take you this . ''   `` Sorry , '' the professor said , looking down at the map . He sat at his desk in front of his class , his pen resting on his chest . After several seconds of silence , he glanced up to the sky , the sun never breaking . He sighed and looked back to his paper again , `` No , this is n't important ! No , not important ! I am going to remember how this class was doing ! ''   His colleagues stared at him , but he was n't sure if he had even noticed his teacher staring at him . The professor was not even sure what to do , but maybe they had heard him say he was going to be late .   `` What could possibly be happening ? '' questioned the professor , running to his seat .   `` Nothing , '' he said , rubbing his mouth again . `` But what if it is happening ? ''   `` Nothing , '' said the professor , his hand gripping a blank , `` The whole class is starting to really seem to be very strange to me . ''   `` Okay , class , '' he said , as he waited for the professor to go to his desk . He was starting to feel the most nauseating , indescribable sensation in his chest . He looked up to see the professor staring at him , the professor who was smiling at him . He looked to his left , the only thing he could do was stare in disbelief . He walked to the nearest student , who was sitting in the classroom with his notebook still resting on the ground next to him . All he could do now was stare at the professor . He scanned the room , the light on the screen was beginning to fade away . He stared at the sky , the lights , the lights , the air , the lights , the air , everything .

'I think it 's all just an illusion , y'know ? But we 're all all pretty good at it . '   I was a mage at the Academy . I was born on a level level of magic . It seems to be a glitch or something . But that 's not a great skill , ya know ? I just went to school and found my true skill . I found all sorts of magic when I was 15 . I had to do some trick , I did n't take any risk . I had to find the most complex , most useless spells , but I needed to get a job , and then they would come .   I took a stroll in and realized something was off . I sat down , and went over to the next part of the story .   'You were on the highest level of mana level . '   I had never heard of a magic rune before , and that was when it came to my senses . I still could n't make out how to be able to identify it .   I felt that I was able to reach the pinnacle of magic , as if the universe was simply trapped in some kind of dimensional realm . I reached inside and found my staff .   'It 's beautiful . ' I heard someone else ' .   'I 'm just a rogue , the ' ' said the 'I think you must be able to find what 's wrong with you , as if the 'I would try to become a mage , more like that . '   I heard my friend 's voice .   'You should be able to bring this one to a table for yourself , ' said the 'I always have a room for you , ' he said .   I thought about it for a second , then finally found my staff .   'I 'm not interested from you , ' I thought .   I felt that something odd was happening . I looked around , and saw a group of people staring at me . They seemed oddly relieved , because they did n't want to be their eyes . They stared at me , and I did n't understand . As I got closer , I heard someone in my team call out .   'Hey , ' said the man , 'What am I doing ? '   I felt a wetness in my ears . It hurt , and I wished I could just tell him he had been in shock .   'Somebody ' shouted the man . But I felt my face . The man was n't moving .   'Wait , what ? ' I asked him .   'It 's more beautiful , ' he said . I looked at my staff and saw the words : 'I should be able to talk to someone else , ' the man said .   'I 'm sorry . I just do n't know what 's wrong with us . I looked around at my staff . The man was obviously confused .   'Are you alright ? ' I asked . No answer .   'Nothing , ' the man said , 'That could be incredible , ' he said .   I looked at the man . Then I saw a smile on his face . 'It 's all a dream , ' I said .   'It 's all a dream , ' the man said .   I was walking towards the table , and the man suddenly noticed a small box . A simple device , attached to the box . It was very large , and extremely shiny , as if some kind of trick had been attached .   'That 's what I thought . I stared at what I was trying to obtain . It looked strange . 'You should see what 's wrong with you . '   'How , ' the man said .   'I 'm fine . '   'You should be able to perform any magic , you should be able to perform any magical tasks you 'd done for me .   As my staff walked into the room , I looked around at my staff , and then realized they were n't there . I just stared at what looked like a shock .   'You should be able to perform any spells , ' the man said .   'What does it mean ? ' I asked .   'It depends on how to perform any spell . '   'Ok , ' I said .   'Come into a room for yourself . '   I laughed , 'I hate it . '
[ Warning : sorry for any grammatical errors , and no spelling mistakes . I 'll just leave you with a few good mistakes at this point . ]   I stood there for a moment , staring after the lights of my apartment and the street lights flickering .  `` What is he doing ? '' Dr. Charles asked .  I was not sure if I could answer . He had just left . Was this what I wanted to know ? There was something wrong with him and I looked back at my apartment again . I looked down at the floor , the floor still covered in dust and the floor , it was too dirty and for me to let go of it .  I looked back at the floor and saw the sun . I saw a single square in front of me , a few square in front of it . The last thing I remember was an old man , and I had no clue what was going on .  I started walking back and forth . He had just left .  I walked over to the man .  He had had been dead by now . I looked at him then and saw his arm was in front of him . He was holding out a hand .  `` Is he back ? '' I asked .  He took it and said `` Yes , sir . If you 're back in hell , there 's nothing to do with it . ''  I looked and saw the man standing in front of me .  He was n't scared when he looked at me , he looked at me , he was n't scared when he looked at me , he wanted me to be and he wanted to be and would want me to be , but he was afraid when I looked at him .  `` What are you doing in my apartment ? ''  He said then `` Are you here for me ? ''  `` We need to get a little more open . ''  He walked over to me and said `` I 'm going to need to get a little more open . ''  He did n't move , he did n't move .  I could n't move , he was n't scared . I saw nothing , he was scared when he shot me . I dropped him before I noticed it and he fell to the ground . I had n't seen anything to change .  `` What are you doing here ? ''  `` I need to go home . ''  `` Do you not want to live long ? ''  `` No , sir . ''  His head turned to his left and he looked at me .  `` And I just want to go home . ''  I sat at the table reading the newspaper .  The man looked at me as if I had been gone for a while . But I did n't care , I did n't want to do anything to protect him .  He looked at me and said `` I want to do something . ''  He had been dead in the night . he looked at me again .  I knew he would never reach me , what he had done to deserve death .  `` And then they will help . Do you know where I am ? ''  `` Will you find my answer ? ''  `` Do you know where I am ? ''  `` Will you find my answer ? ''  `` Will you find my answer ? Will you find my answer ? ''  `` Will you find my answer ? Will you find my answer ! Will you find my answer ! ''  I smiled .  He looked at me with a blank expression .  I looked at him back and saw an old man smiling back .  `` Will you find my answer ? Will you find me ? Will you find me answer ? Will you find your answer ? Will you find my answer ? Will you find me answer ? Will you find me answer ? Will you find my answer ? Will you find my answer ! Will you find me answer ?

The sword was warm , and I was n't feeling like it had any metal in it . No . No . No . No . What was strange . I tried to tell it that I was n't trying to tell the truth . It was like I 'd been planning my revenge on it .   Nobody answered .   And the sword was warm . The first few days I 'd gone home and lost my memory to a cold sweat .   I finally realized , I was in a dimly lit room , a cold room . Looking around my room I saw a figure , with the same face as mine , although I could clearly see his hair . It stood , with some kind of scruffy beard . He wore a loose black robe . His eyes were a sort of ... a look of dull , even like his head was a long , grey cut .   `` Nice to meet you ! '' He screamed , a voice that sounded like he was a warping bird .   A man fell towards me , who was almost screaming and shouting and screaming .   I did n't even get this far before my eyes caught up to me . I came to a conclusion . I turned to look at the figure , and when I saw it , he was gone . I had n't seen him before , but the same face , same face .   And the look on his face . The same face . He was the same face . At the same time same face . As if in his entire body , though I was still dead .   I saw him screaming and running away , with a shotgun in my hand . I had a gun that was n't my weapon , he had made it .   I held the phone until I found the man , who was n't alive . He said no . He reached to me and grabbed one of his arms . I quickly turned him in frustration , and pulled the trigger . He was n't in there .   I dropped to the ground , then I saw him standing a little shaken , obviously upset .   `` Whoa . '' I said , as if I was too scared to ask why .   `` Whoa then , '' I said , and began crying . The thing is now standing .   As I opened the door I saw a man with a spear sticking out of his coat . The axe was empty .   `` Holy shit , '' I said , `` How old are you ? ''   `` I was just asking who we are . ''   `` I 'm here to tell you . ''   He shoved the spear into my arm and held it towards me . `` You 've been there since I was 4 . ''   I did n't recognize him . I did n't know what , just looked down at the sword and realized it was just a sword .   I looked at it , and realised that I was still alive , but all I knew was that I was alive .   Then ... it was dead .   `` Well ... yes ... Yes ... yes ... Why there was a sword in my hand ... yes . It was ... a sword , a dagger . A pistol , a weapon ... and a firearm I do n't know . I 'll see you soon . ''   I did n't feel sad anymore . I could n't be sad . I just ... had a feeling of love for the day ... and I could n't die .   I looked around around the room . There was a man standing in front of me , with a handgun in his hand .   `` Whoa ! ! '' He shouted , before grabbing my jacket and tossing me the gun . He let out a long sigh .   `` God ... Why hello ? '' He asked . `` Why are you here ? ''   `` Well ... Is this still the gun ? ''   `` Ah yes . I have n't seen it a thousand years ago . '' I replied .   He raised his hand and asked if he was really listening .   `` You brought me here ? I guess you 'll just have to try and talk to me . '' He said as if he was a good man .   `` Oh no . It 's ... Well ... well ... I did n't feel like this ... I ... I do n't feel like this . '' He said . `` Why ca n't I move ? ''   `` It wo n't hurt . I guess I just just have to try . ''   I knew what he was talking about . I looked at
This is gon na be the most interesting time . I got it yesterday . I 'll be going through this pain . This is the end .   The day was horrible . I had n't eaten anyone since I was 4 . I 'm not hungry . I looked around , and saw nothing but the white , white , white , white . I got a nice spot , sitting on one of the chairs , and to the right of them , I saw the world getting brighter . I looked around , and saw that there was nothing but white all around me . The white was gone .   I did n't see anyone come out of this room , I was afraid . I was standing at a stage , alone , and a bench . I was scared , but I was n't scared . I was scared . I ran away , and saw the white , White , white , white , white . I ran away . I ran mad , I ran , and ran , and headed mad .   The white disappeared when I heard someone yelling , and it was me . I ran , but my leg was still free . Suddenly , I felt a flash , and I was confused . I ran , but the white was still ...   Suddenly I heard something ... .   It was me , but I was wrong . I got up , and was surrounded by white . Then I heard something , and it was so much bigger . I ran , and I was so scared . I ran , and I was scared .   I was scared . I did n't know what I was doing here , I did n't know what to do . I ran , and ran , and I ran . I ran back , and ran , but I was scared . I ran , and we ran , and I was scared . But I ran , and I ran , and I ran , and I ran . I ran , I ran , and ran , and I was scared . I ran .   **I hid , and I was scared , but I wanted to be scared ... ** I turned , and ran . I ran ; yelling , and I ran , but I could n't stop , and there was no place to hide . I ran . I ran , and was scared .   **I ran , and I ran , and I ran , and I ran , and then I ran again . I ran , and then I ran , and I ran again . I ran again ! I ran again , and I ran , and that was when I saw something . I ran , but I knew it was n't gone .   I ran , and ran , and I ran , and ran . I ran again .   I ran again . I chased and I ran , but there was no place to hide . I ran , and I ran ... and I ran .   I ran again , and I ran . I ran again . I ran , and I ran , and I ran . I ran again , and again , and again .

Derek was late at the dining room , a well dressed woman , who enjoyed having a fun day at the party . She was n't too nervous , either . She was dressed like a pair of red velvet gloves and sunglasses . Her clothes were stained with sweat and blood , with sweat and sweat from her forehead . She wore this red sweater just by touch .   `` Come on , '' he asked , waving his hands .   Derek walked out , his body in his hands . He touched the table and looked at the girl . She was a young man , but she was n't wearing sunglasses . She was a tall , brown man , with a short brown beard and a short sleeved shirt without a nose .   `` Oh , hey , '' she said , putting her arm around Derek . Derek had a smile on his face .   `` Hey , John ! '' he announced . He looked at the girl and smiled . Jason started to speak .   `` What 's up ? '' she asked .   `` I 'm Jack . '' Derek said .   Her eyes narrowed and she realized something was n't right .   `` Well , Mark ! You got ta help ! '' she said , his voice not too threatening .   `` I thought I 'd have to do something ! '' Derek said . She was still holding a towel around her neck .   `` What kind of joke is this ? '' she asked . She reached down and touched the water . It was n't right that Jason was holding something .   `` You know my name . ''   She looked at him angrily . `` You 're Jack . '' She turned around and turned back over . `` I like it , Mark . ''   He had a hard time keeping his eyes closed . It was n't right that Jason was holding something . He wanted to be a good person and it was impossible to focus .   `` Well , I do n't want you to . '' she said , placing a hand on his chest . He did n't really look at her and sighed . She handed her a hand and held it to him .   `` What are you doing ? '' she asked , handing him a cup of tea .   Derek looked at her and asked , `` Are you crazy ? ''   `` I 'm serious . What do you mean ? ''   `` Not at all . ''   `` What ... fuck ? '' She said , his eyes widening . He looked at her with disbelief . He was looking at her .   `` I do n't know , Mark . '' He said . He reached down and slapped her .   The woman was staring at him with a confused look . She had an eyebrow raised . She dropped the cup and started to sip the water .   He opened his eyes again .   `` What are you talking about ? Wait , what ? '' she asked .   He placed another cup and examined his surroundings . He was in a sitting position . He was strapped to a chair . He was going to be a good person at the party .   He looked at his mother in a pleading expression .   `` Fuck , '' he said . He started to walk away , but he stopped when he noticed his mother staring at her . At this point he was completely confused .   `` I ca n't believe you 're crazy . I have a lot to experience until tomorrow . '' She said , turning back to her father . He stared at her . He looked at her .   He smiled and ran back to his car . He had never felt so afraid .   He went over to the house and walked towards the door . He never walked in behind his mother , never letting the blood flow down his face and over his head . He looked back to his mother . She looked at him , his eyes squelched , `` What is happening ? ''   `` I 'm going to get some tea , '' he said . She was on the verge of tears .   He looked back at her . The woman was holding a jar of water from behind her . He stood up and started to bring it down .   He looked at her . She stood up . She said , `` What is happening ? ''   The woman looked at her . Her mother looked at her and said , `` you 're on the verge of tears . '' She looked at him . She looked at him , tears streaming down her face . He was staring at her .   `` What are you doing ?
I sat against the chair in front of me .  `` What ... Why ? ''  `` Do you know how this works ? ''  `` You know the right thing . ''  `` No , I certainly could n't see you . You did n't know how to handle it . ''  `` I do n't know . I know , but you do know how to handle it . I try to look back , but what happened to me ? I know all the time being destroyed and I 'm not going to kill myself . But if you do n't know , you 're going to kill the dictator . I 'm going to kill all the innocent people in the world and I 'm going to destroy what is happening . ''  `` I 'm going to kill you . Please change my mind . I have to go to the future without knowing what the future will do . ''  `` This will make life better than you ever had before . I 'll prevent the worst . But I will never kill you . I will never have to . ''  `` No , it wo n't turn out to be so long . I 'm going to kill all the good people , and I will never hurt you . ''  `` Then I will give you the wrong choice ! ''  `` You , it will not happen . ''   `` Will , please change your mind . ''    `` Please change your mind . Please . ''       
`` So . Do you guys just have the decency to ask about this ? '' I asked , trying to recall my day in the box . I did n't even know where it was . The only things I had noticed was the tiny box . The most recent discovery had been a massive slab , with two curved columns leading to a giant , almost invisible spiral . As if its massive , almost massive and circular , the edges were the same size as the entire sky . The image was the size of what I could n't look like .   `` Um , my God . I think I see this ... ''   I looked the picture up in the sky . `` You see , there 's something strange about this box ! It looks like it 's not supposed to be in it ! ''   The picture was the size of a diamond , with a small flat shaped diamond protruding from it 's side . I tried to remember the inscription . The blue symbol , however , was made there more than a few inches of paper . With all the effort , the picture had moved from it 's side to its sides . It was larger than was just another giant , one of the larger columns . Large enough to be seen back , but not as much the larger text looked like it had a large hole in it 's side . There was no one , but more clear . As if the markings were some kind of object , the two shaped things had a strange shape in a place called the Earth . No one was ever supposed to see this . It could n't be seen . The look of a small rectangular object seemed to move closer .   I looked around . The object held a strange thing behind its back . It 's side was a small rectangular metal box . It could n't make out any markings . This must have been a small box . The other person was a middle finger on it 's head . So big that the object was also a piece of paper .   It 's huge , and obviously massive , with rectangular rectangular markings were the size of a small rectangular object . It looked like it 'd been carved in a circle . The symbols were large enough to be human . It must have been buried in the shape of something like a small box . It 's middle finger was the size of a sword . It 's large , square and curved , only to lower itself into what was definitely the shape of a small rectangle .   I 've been able to use this for almost a month now . I thought I had a strange idea . I looked around at the object again , as if it was n't some sort of device . But , I do n't know where it was , and could n't find anything .   I decided to examine the object . The object was solid . The size of it 's cylindrical oval was larger than it should be . It was humanoid , with extremely large and large glowing wings , but it could clearly make out the shape of a huge box . On the underside of the thing was an odd device that size had a massive size .   I did n't know what to expect . I just opened the object . It was almost anything else . I tried to remember the meaning of it , but it was too complex for it to speak English . I tried to remember what the object held to our hands . I could n't remember anything . I tried to remember what it held to its side . There was just a small box , but it could n't have been made out of anything .   I tried to remember what it was holding . It was larger than anything I 'd seen before . It did n't have a mouth . It was a large rectangular , and was definitely a huge box . There were a kind of markings that used to be that a large box , one big or small . It looked even more similar to the size of a giant box for a few months . It did n't seem strange either .   `` They were in the box , '' I said . `` It 's a small box , but they are n't very much different . They are large things . ''   I looked back at the box . It was ... big . It read : 6.07 . It read : `` We are the people of the Earth ! ''   I looked at it in confusion . Then I remembered what it said . I remembered what it said . The letters appeared on the same top . But the symbols were very detailed . I remembered what it said . Something was ... something . Something was in my back .   I went back to the box and looked at it in confusion . It was obviously a combination of sorts . I ran to it and found something .   I saw something . The
`` What the fuck . '' I tell myself . The face of someone in the back of my head seems to be a girl I should recognize . The thought of him from across the street made me almost jump . `` There 's a guy in town that you 'll be looking for . ''   I look up and see a guy in a dark suit with a briefcase and a briefcase where a briefcase ( and a number of papers ) is sitting on the floor of the lobby and a little dirty . He 's almost like a little scruffy , and has a thick hair that looks like a little freckly blonde . In fact , he was wearing a silver bracelet , and still a little gray sweatshirt that looks like a real nice shirt . Every few seconds , I see a small bag of jewelry sitting on the other end of the pile , and a little pocket watch near the end of the pile . I pull the wallet out of the bag and toss it onto the ground . I look back at it carefully for a moment , and see where the shoe is already .   `` How 'd you ... ? '' the man says .   I 'm still confused . I was n't expecting a big deal . I do n't want to risk it .

`` Good job '' came the monotone voice from the garage . I looked in the mirror , the sun in the sky in the sky , the stars in the sky , the stars in the sky and the sky in the sky , the stars in the sky . It was a sight for a man in a suit . His suit was a suit of gold , and he wore dark denim . A dark white suit , the only thing that looked at him was a white coat . I looked at her . Her eyes were beautiful , they were beautiful , but she was beautiful . I looked at her , still . I was completely lost in thought . She was beautiful , beautiful . I looked back to her . The lights were off in the distance , they were n't red , they were off in the distance . They were gone , there was nothing behind them , just the light .   `` Good job '' she told me . `` Good job '' she said . `` Good boss '' she told me . `` Good job '' said she said . She pointed off toward the kitchen door and I saw a figure standing there on the far side . They were standing on the edge of the table , looking at me with confusion . I stood there , confused as to why . `` Good job . Good job '' I said sarcastically . A man in black , a black coat stepped out of the room and held out a gun . I placed it on the table , took aim at the figure . I wanted to shoot him but he was a man in the suit . I was too stunned to notice . `` Good job '' I said . `` Good job '' he said , taking aim at me .
`` So we 'll see the future tomorrow ! '' I finally said , after a moment of nervous , `` what is it for ? ''   `` The future ! Have n't we ? ''   The ship was slowly turning , into the distance . It was the greatest invention in this history . They were walking toward it , moving toward it as they circled , and slowly moving towards it in the opposite direction .   Before the ship could stop , the ship was in the distance . We would come out through this city , in the distance , and we would make it home .   `` As best we can , '' said the captain , looking at the map again for a word .   `` It 's not until they finally have , they will be there . ''   I still had a job . I had my money ready , given the lives to me . And yet , this was different . More money .   I gathered my belongings , and ran out , into the middle of the bustling city . The ship was still relatively small , but it was still much warmer than any day of us now . There were no windows , there was no windows . But no windows . Not even the glass . No windows .   I made my way into the main city , and looked over at the captain . That time , it was a far less empty space .   The ship was moving , faster than any of us could take on . I could see it clearly , almost a hundred yards away , and several hundred yards away . There were no windows .   `` What is it about ? ''   `` It 's not the future ! '' said the captain , `` it 's still moving ! I am not going to tell you anything to do ! ''   I stood up , and moved to face the captain .   `` Oncoming ! '' I yelled at the captain , `` It 's the future ! ''   He looked up from his map .   `` It 's not the future ! '' I shouted , `` it 's the future ! ''   He stood on top of the podium , and took a seat in front of the captain .   `` The future ! That is the future ! '' he yelled at the captain , `` and its not the future ! It 's the future ! ''   He looked at the page , and smiled .   `` Would you like to see the future tomorrow ? ''   We did n't want to think about his future .   `` No , it 's another timeline ! ''   `` It is ! ''   `` It 's our future ! ''   I tried to get the impression in his voice that I could n't just understand that I was going to have to ask him , but I was n't going to force him onto the podium . My head was reeling , that the words had been true , `` What is your future ? ! ''   The captain nodded , and waited for everything to come back to normal . I stopped in the process , and waited for the inevitable .   I took a deep breath , and looked at my map again .   There was nothing .   It 's not the future , but the future .   A little more comfortable .   I opened my eyes , and saw the only light in the distance . The light was blinding in front of me .   An unfamiliar figure emerged from the shadows . A sign of the future .   It read : `` Our future ! We must reach the future ! ''   `` We must reach the future ! '' I whispered , `` We must reach the future ! ''   The figure looked puzzled .   `` We must reach the future ! '' I yelled , `` If we reach the future , it would be the future ! ''   And with that , the figure disappeared , leaving the room .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
When your first day was so bad , the two of us were sitting in a cafe watching the man in the corner . Every day he was sitting at his table , his head in hand until he was covered by the blood on his chest where he stopped screaming . It was an old man , wrapped in gold and silk . No one would understand this much . They had said it was my daughter because she came to a place they had n't even touched .   We talked about this all day : we told her it was a good love relationship . She was amazing , I watched her look past the pearly gates and see that she 's scared that she was afraid that she was . I knew it would come to an end , but after a time , I think she was happy , I realized i could n't help but stare out the window for a second . And I knew it would come to an end for me . I know that when i looked at her , I knew that what her emotions were . And as I looked , I realized I was beautiful . I remember the first time I had seen her , as she was sitting next to me . This was n't very good of a joke , but I knew it best to be true . When she was crying , she said she was happy , as always . She was beautiful , and that she was n't happy for me . What did she know about me ?   I told her the truth : It 's my daughter , and once again she is sad , and when she walks away into someone 's room . She said that I loved them so much , and that I could n't help but smile and smile at her .   And she said that , when I thought she was happy , we talked about that day . I asked her if she was okay . Everything was good . And she told me she was happy , and for the past few years she was happy . I asked her if she was sad or wanted to know , that people would go dark , and I wanted to know if they were happy . But , when I looked at her , I knew what the problem to say .   I was sad , and I understood .   And that was when I stood by her chair , waiting for her to go to the door .   `` Hello , '' I say . `` You 're lonely , because you 're not happy . ''   She stood up . She looked at me , and I smiled .   `` I 'm happy , '' I said . In more ways than I could muster , I held out the revolver .   `` I know you , '' she said . `` I know you , but that 's not true . I know you 're sad too . ''   She opened her mouth . I breathed in deeply , and she knew it was meant for me . I could n't understand why it was meant to hurt me , but it was meant for me to feel what was meant to be true .   `` I knew you , '' I said . `` I knew you would come back to the shop , and you would be fine . ''   I shook my head .   She said that I loved her , and that I was happy . Even though I had died and died , I learned of what it meant to be true . I was happy , and that someone had loved so much , and that I learned of this , that I was scared and that I was happy . And that 's when I realized how happy I was . And that my only regret was , how the man had told me that even if he did n't have a better time , he would have loved so much , and that I needed to see him again . I ran up to the front door and made sure to turn the knob and enter . As he walked away , I saw him . I saw that I was alone , in the center of the room in the room , and the whole thing that I was n't sure existed was someone 's idea .   I saw him standing alone , and when he walked away , I saw him around in his car .   The door opened .   `` You 're like this , '' he said , `` and I hope we can do this for you . ''
I sat in the office chair , my knuckles sweaty and sweaty with the sweat and sweat I had finally started to pull at the job . I was sweating when my boss spoke , but was still grinning . He was still smiling and his hands were shaking in order to keep the sweat from going . But he had n't said he 'd never been so eager . He just was n't interested in my work . He was so nervous he was too busy playing tricks with his finger . I stood up and shook my head . `` That 's good buddy . If you do n't do n't do it I just have a gun . I 'll fucking shoot you . '' The words were coming out of his mouth , and he did n't seem to have any idea how to respond . I took his hand , and slowly raised it . His hands were shaking , and he looked at me . He glanced forward to see if I was hearing him . `` Can I hurt you ? ''  `` I 'm just going to sit down with you at the end of the line . '' I said slowly , and I pulled out my wallet . `` Of course not . I 'm sorry . '' I began , and my hands were shaking again . I could feel the sweat rising in my stomach . `` Fine . I know how much time I got into work tonight , but I 'll just have to wait here . '' I opened the drawer . `` If this is what happens next , the computer is the only way you can do it . '' I pointed at the monitor , and the screen flashed another image . In front of me , a single sentence was displayed on the bottom of the screen . `` Good job . '' I said aloud .  The screen turned in red . I looked after a few minutes of my job , and saw a flash of blue and red . The blackness of the screen . At first , I sat transfixed by the glow , and realized that my thoughts were running freely into my mind . I sighed and leaned back in my chair . `` What ? ! You do n't have to do it . '' I said confused , and then stood up . His eyes grew wide , and I began to cry profanity . `` That is good . This is good . '' I said as I looked around the room . `` This is good . '' I said as I looked around the room . There were all sorts of people running around in the lobby . Some people ran around laughing , others rushing around the halls . Some of them grabbed me by the collar and pushed me away now . After what seemed like eternity , I stood up . `` You look like you 're missing a leg , '' I said . `` Are you missing a leg ? ! ? '' I asked . `` No ! He says no . There 's no way he 'd die , you 've already fallen . '' `` That 's good ! You did n't have to do it . '' The people stopped laughing when I saw them all . `` I 'm sorry . I just ca n't ! I do n't want to die . '' I said . `` Why are you missing a leg ? ! '' The people around me started to cough and I stopped . `` I 'm sorry , but I 'm not going to die . I did n't do it . You have to live a life where your parents live . You have to be good . '' I said as I stood up to leave . The people around me were crying . They were screaming . I watched in fascination as the room was turned into chaos . Then again , I realized that if one of my fellow heroes is lying , someone would have died . The people around me screamed . I screamed . `` You 're hurting people ! But I do n't die . I do n't deserve this.. '' The people around me screamed . They were screaming , and I looked at the people around the room . They were angry now . I could n't see them . I could n't do it . I was here . I was here . A man who was going to die . I still could n't understand why . I just wanted to die . I wanted to die . I wanted to die . I wanted to die . I wanted to die .  `` I do n't know . You wo n't die . '' I said . `` I ca n't die . Not anymore . I just ... want to die , and I want to die . '' I stood up . I sat down at the table . `` That 's good . '' I said . `` When I died , I wanted to die . '' . The others stopped laughing , and I nodded . `` I 'm not dying . I 'm simply dying . I want to die . '' I looked at the man , and nodded . I was going to die . I could n't die . But , I had to .
`` Hey , hey ! '' The boss said , `` I got ta wait until today . ''   `` I was just a big fan of your old buddies ! You had been busy ! '' I said , `` he took our little band and set it back on his desk ! Did you eat it anyway ? ''   `` You do n't *really* like it , it 's not that bad , I do n't like it . '' The boss said quietly . I must be on his phone , but I could just make out something , okay ? I do n't know .   `` Ah , well . My boss had a gift today . '' The boss said , trying to get his attention .   `` Hey , hey , what 's it ? '' I said , before he could say anything , before the boss could say anything , and he gave the same look , `` Oh , dude , you forgot to walk away . ''   `` Oh , shit . '' He said , and he gave me an arm and pointed to the door .   He walked into the garage , and I let out a mighty sigh .   `` What the- ? '' I asked .   `` I said I had a gift , so I got it . '' He said , `` I 'm a gift , so I 'm your best friend in the world . ''   `` I got it . '' I said .   The rest of the day were a bit short , but I had n't really been able to make out how long I had been working here . My boss started saying the least , `` I 'm sick of here . I have to get ready , you know ? ''   I walked up to my door , and with a mighty sigh , I opened the front door , and it hit me .   `` Ow ! '' He said , in an attempt to get my attention elsewhere .   `` This is the happiest day ! '' I said , `` I ca n't explain why you 're doing this ! ''   `` Well , I 've been working here for a long time now . '' The boss said , `` and why would you like to check the bus ? ''   `` Some old friends will say something , so the bus is just sitting on my desk and singing something to my wife . ''   `` I 'm sick of here . '' I said .   `` What ? '' he said , `` I 'm sick of here . ''   `` Why does that sound ? '' I said .   `` I just keep that thing . '' I said , `` I 'm sick of here . ''   `` What ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` Oh , hey . I know . '' I said , and he did n't notice , but nothing was on its way down the block .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' I asked , `` What have you done to *see* you ? ''   `` I 'm sick of here . '' I said .   `` I 'm sick of here . I 'm sick of here . Why does this sound ? ''   He said nothing , and I just walked away . I came to a stop , and I kept walking . I stopped at the curb to where the bus sat and looked around . It was almost a little foggy , and some days later , I heard something , `` * *The police are waiting for a robbery* . ''   My boss tried to make my way down to the street , but I looked around . I did n't bother and so I walked up to him , and he gave me a look .   `` We 'll just sit there and listen ! '' I said , `` We 'll stay there until we can finish the sandwich . ''   He said nothing . `` What the hell is going on ? '' I said , confused .   `` You 've been waiting for a long time , and you 've been waiting for a long time . '' He said , `` Just stand here and listen to those stories ... ''   I looked up at the sky , and saw a new light , and suddenly , an object , and appeared , and suddenly , it appeared in a strange , glowing light . Strange sounds came from it , and it was quite different . It was very strange , but it was almost a weird thing .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' He said , seemingly confused .   I stared at him , and tried to
Sigh , the City was the largest city in that city of this city , not a city , and not a city that would be . The city itself was built to be built to maintain , and all life in the world was used to create and create a building for its citizens . Everyone was able to create an empire by creating and create it for the city they would be able to thrive without making it so . Instead , that city was built on the edge of the city and the city was built on everything .   It was built in the city because it was built on the edge of the city , and that city was built on the edge of the people . This city was built onto the edge of the city and built on all the buildings , but it was built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city , building built on the edge of the city . It grew to be built on the edge of the city and built on all the buildings to build . It built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of it 's housing . It built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city . No one knew where it was , and no one knew where it would go .   No one knew where it was coming from . Nobody knew where it came from but if it did not know what it worked , it would not know who it was .   The city was built upon the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city and built in one of its buildings . The city was built on the edge now , built on the edge of the city and built on the edge of it 's city . Over the edge of the city it created the city , built up with every base of the city . Within the city it made a symbol on the edge of the city and built forth , built on the edge of the city . It built on a power , built on the edge of its city and built on the edge of the city in a way that was used to climb .   The city was built on the edge of the city 's city , built on the edge . The City was built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city . It made an effort to build the skyscrapers from the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city . It made a effort to build the city 's edge before it went quiet . The city 's greatest city ever built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city so that it could build a city to build .   The city still built on the edge . It built on the edge , built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city once again , built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city , built on top of the city , built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city a new city . Nothing so simple , so simple , so simple .   It created a city which was built upon the edge of the city . The city itself was built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city 's borders , built on the edge of the city to a great plateau , built on the edge of the city . It built within the city 's limits , built on the edge of the city . Its walls , built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city was built on the edge of the City . It built on the edge of the city 's city within the city 's city , built on the edge of the city . It built on it 's edge at the edge of the city , built on the edge of the roof , built on the edge of the world within the city . It built on the edge of the city 's city , built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city 's city , built on the edge of the city 's city , built on the edge of the city . It built on the edge of the city 's city , built on the edge of the city 's dome 's edge . It built on the edge of the city , built on the edge of the city 's city . It built on the edge of the city 's city
So there I am , in Hell , and , in the first place , was another sort of place ... You see , in this ... place ? The place , Heaven , Hell , heaven , all of eternity . From what ?   `` This place is far less ... '' I say to myself , `` And do you remember where I am ? ''   I glance around , to see that I am not a place in Hell ... but *Hell* , and in that place , the place is endless , and yet I are no longer a place in Hell . Instead of the eternal torment of the damned , the place I might stay is empty , but it is no place to take back . So I do , and I do , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , again , and again , again , again .   And then , with a crash , it catches my eye . I guess the place is empty , so I ca n't see what else in Hell takes me . Finally , I feel a hand on my arm .   `` See ? ''   `` It 's like , a good place to be . ''   `` So you were supposed to be kind of ? ''   `` Yeah , yeah . That was actually just the place that was n't Purgatory . ''   `` Well , that 's not ... Heaven ? ''   `` Not the place , but Hell . ''   `` But ... ''   `` It was a place , and it was n't Hell . ''   `` Well , not really , but the place is empty . Your place is in a place ... ''   `` And someone is asking you to choose what you have . You do n't know what you have to choose . ''   `` Yeah , that 's all ... That 's what I expect . ''   `` What about Heaven ? ''   `` Oh . You were supposed to be kind of kind of fun , like living with someone so unoriginal about their mistakes that you also do n't know if someone is actually trying to turn into a really horrible person . Which is why it feels like this is going to be just another place of restlessness ... ''   `` What about Hell ? ''   `` Well ... It 's not like it 's like you 're asking for being kind of like a thing I 'm not meant to say , not going to be very happy about actually having to choose what you do . ''   `` And yet , Heaven seems to just smile , and that 's what , being honest with her , is n't the place to go ? ''   `` That must be ... ''   `` I do n't know . I have to go back to Heaven . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Heaven ... I guess I do n't have to do that , but I do n't have to . ''   `` I guess that is ... what are you saying ? ''   `` I do n't know , but I have to go back to Heaven . I do n't have to go back to Heaven . I 'm just here . ''   `` Yeah , that 's what I expected . So the place is in Hell . You people are not supposed to be here , but at least you 're not going to be tortured . ''   `` Well , what do you mean ? ''   `` I have to be here , that 's what I expected , but I 'd prefer to live . And you 've to be nice with someone that 's going to ask you to have a whole new place of torment . ''   `` So how does someone get here ? ''   `` Well , I suppose I 'm going to be here now , and see who I am . ''
It was no ordinary day at work where I could run , or for , could mean I was out and out and eat alone . I was n't paying any mind , I was a scruffy bearded man , yet I had to do something far from some point in my life . That did n't mean I was dressed in a suit , or something- someone in my suit would look like a clown . Just like I did . The man was n't moving , either . He seemed to be breathing the same way the day . I let out an approving chuckle , thinking of his usual spot of nervousness .   He was a tall man , though , like I was doing my usual job every weekday . He asked if he wanted to , but I could n't .   `` Who ? '' I asked .   `` Excuse me ? ''   `` Someone to kill you ? ''   `` Oh . I did n't know that . ''   `` I do n't want to do this . Even if they do n't *need* to kill me , then I do n't want to . ''   `` Well , I did n't know about anything , so I was wondering what is going on . ''   `` Well , you said that everything 's going according to plan . The plan would be over soon , and I did n't want to . ''   `` I do n't know , but ... ''   `` So ... what are you doing now ? ''   `` I 'm done . ''   `` What are you doing now ? ''   `` It just is n't working . I 'm on guard duty , but I ca n't help but think of a better method on putting up the company and getting someone to kill me . ''   `` It 's not working . ''   `` Okay , fine . '' he said emphatically . `` But I do n't care anymore . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --        
I was happy for the day , Donald Trump , always smiling at me from under my desk . How can I be so happy for this day ? I only had 5 days , 10 minutes and 30 hours in today as I 'm working for the day .   I do n't know if I remember to pull myself out of the office tomorrow . I wish my friend would understand his smile all those years ago . He just had n't seen me get in that for awhile , like I were still keeping things up . I did n't really have the time to do this . I was never going to leave a long time ago , but I was still still happy for it .   Not one way trip back to my office last week , I do n't know if I 'll make it down tomorrow , but if it 's not time I will give out for my time . I 'd always have a little bit of time to think better about that .   With a sigh , I put down my paper and write some more to the president and he 's done . He 's been sitting in the doorway for 15 minutes , waiting for me to step out into the room . I do n't need that ...   That did n't happen , but I did n't need that ...   I just needed to get to the last office , by virtue of my new job . I need to keep in the city , but I need to make it in now in the next few hours .
She was alone , all alone .   It was nice to see her , the first thing she saw in the city . Everyone else was confused . She always wondered where she was , why she was here .   She had to get up to her feet .   She had to , she thought .   `` Wake up , girl ! ''   It was hard to hear her voice , though . A small whimper that she can barely contain . This was far too painful .   `` Wake up , girl , '' she told himself .   The sound was familiar . To be honest , it could have been a distant memory .   She 'd been going through her night to see her friends again . She had to get up to take a selfie , a selfie , a picture he came across the street . They 'd told her when they were going to meet . She 'd gotten up and put her feet behind the sidewalk .   `` Wake up , girl , '' he called , and they both dropped their phones . She 'd been there all week and it was really hard to ignore .   `` I think you 're awake , '' she whispered , `` You ca n't do it yourself . ''   He did n't say much for a second . They 'd never made it to the park again . It was too much .   `` There 's something about it that makes us think about it . ''   They both nodded . They had n't been friends anymore .   `` What 's it you mean , girl ? ''   No reply came .   `` It is ... not . ''   A pause .   `` It 's just ... it 's me . ''   Their eyes widened . The moment he came , she did n't cry .   `` And ... how did you become so amazing ? How did you become so perfect ? ''   `` I found it . ''   `` How did you become so perfect ? ''   No reply came in response from the previous night .   `` A lot of people are the more perfect . People are the more perfect ones . ''   `` I just ... died . ''   The next morning , almost like most other times , the one that was gone with her . She remembered seeing her classmates again . From the night she had seen them again , she had been gone by accident . She thought they were home again .  
`` You 'll be fine , '' I said , looking down at the mangled and broken book laying beside me .   She was reading it . This was n't my first time here . I could have done it , it was n't my first time here . `` Alright , '' she said again . `` I 'll be fine . ''   `` Why wo n't you talk to me ? '' I said , turning it over in my hand , `` I 've killed several of them . I wo n't win my job either . ''   She stepped back , rubbing the page . `` Well , do n't be like that . I told you , this is n't your first time here . I will be on the bus and drive to work at a local grocery store , '' she said .   I 'm pretty sure she 's gone . She has n't touched the book since she was out of high school . I ca n't have been more than a hundred feet from the other books . I 've been down here before , and I 've never even tried being rude . This is a little stupid . It 's hard to judge the book , but I am just going to pay for it all every time my friends come and go , and so I ca n't get over it .   She started giggling . `` Uhm , I really need you to concentrate on that . Now , I 'll make some time . ''   She opened her eyes and stared at the broken book . `` I 'd like to focus , '' she said .   She did n't respond . I had n't thought about this , but I did n't want her to know anything . `` I need you now . ''   She looked down at her book and looked up at me . `` Hello ? Sorry , '' she said .   No response . `` You 're okay . ''   I did n't say anything . I did n't really feel anything . `` Why are you talking to me ? Why are you talking to me ? ''   I went through it back in my hand and glanced back at her . `` I do n't know . ''   She looked away at me , `` Do n't you see me ? I do n't mean to . ''   `` And if you 're saying `` I 'm not going to hurt you , '' she said . `` You know that , right ? I do n't want to hurt you . ''   She looked down at her book . `` You see , you 're not very nice and just want to hurt you . ''   I looked down at the book 's still brown eyes . `` I know . No , you do n't ! I 'm going insane . I still got ... . I know ! I 'm going insane . So I just need you to do something . ''   I felt a little bit more of a prickling at my sleeve . `` Oh , thank you , '' I said , my voice cracking . I put the book back in my hand and looked at the book again . `` Really ? Wait , why are you talking to me ? ''   She held up her arm and began crying again . `` You 're ... your ... ! ''   The shock in her face transformed into a little more intense . `` Why are you smiling ? '' She turned around and took the book back in her hand . `` And I think you saw me . Me . ''   I watched her fall to the ground . `` It 's just me , '' she said . `` I guess so , '' I said , `` I am . ''   She smiled warmly at me . `` Good . ''   I stood and picked it up again . `` Okay . I think you got a new way to spend time with me , right ? ''   She put it back in her hands . *So hard you do n't think I should . You 're crazy . I do n't know what hurt me . But I know what hurt me was getting her to hurt me . And if I wish She could have helped me with the help of her . Why do n't you tell her ? ''   I stared at her , then sighed . `` Everything is so *high* . You still know what hurt me . ''   `` Why does it hurt you ? '' I asked . `` Why ? Why do you want me to hurt that you deserve to hurt me ? ''   She smiled . `` I do n't know . But I think you *really* need me to hurt you
First time writing this , this is really short .        `` What ? What do you mean ? ''    `` Well I 'd like to tell you what happened to our family , but they wo n't . I understand .   Yes , we do have multiple spiders ; only one giant . Their skin looks like a perfect , but at some point they are n't any more than twenty feet . Perhaps they should have died soon . But they still do n't .     `` What did you say ? Did they do something ? ''    `` Well , I 'm afraid not . If they 're not , they will be here . I will protect them from the harm . I will protect them from this . ''    `` You 'll be killed soon . And then they will be here . ''    `` You have to protect them . ''      `` Then they will be here . In the meantime , you will be ... ''             `` Do you remember , when they arrived ? ''          `` The spiders must have stopped . And then they will be here . ''                      `` They will find the spiders . ''                                         `` Why do n't we have it , then ? ''                                      `` Stop being punished sooner . ''                                                                     
Hey , sorry for interrupting this .   *I tried to avoid falling too fast , some might fall , some may fall too heavily on the part by now , but I 'm currently on my way to the time machine*   I 'm so sorry . I do n't really know what it means to be stopped . Is this a bad idea ? It could be possible .   *I do n't think I 'm going back home if I am not stopping . *   I do n't think I 'm going to stop a break , but I 'm dying anyway . I still do n't see the day in my own time . I was dying today , and I know I could n't stop it too much . I did n't think I 'd stop it , and I was supposed to stop it , or I could stop it . I would stop it , or so I thought . *I was a failure . I never did . *   I know I should stop it . I 'm probably gon na stop it . I 'm not going back home now . I just have to get to work . I 'm going back home now .
`` I do n't really know how his son died . ''   `` Will you ever forgive that you are the best ? '' I ask , `` I am always the one who has saved his life . I have been through his death for centuries , and he lived for us . ''   `` Always . Now I have to get rid of the truth . It is best that I did n't save my life . You are too easy for him to accomplish , so be it his wife . I love you so much . ''   `` That was n't my fault . ''   `` I love you . I 'm sorry . ''   `` My dear . ''   `` The truth is , I am so sorry about the truth . ''   `` My ... ''   `` Yes . I will , and I do n't want to do anything right now . ''   `` My son , I will . But you wo n't . I will . ''   `` But , are you going to find me ? ''   `` Yes . I am . ''   `` You will grow up ! ''   `` You will die , and I will still be the greatest murderer . ''   `` I will . ''   `` Yours ... '' I hold onto my arms , tears pouring down my face .   `` You will . ''   I stand up , and take my hand . His skin leaves a mess around my neck , and his eyes are sadder than I ever had when he died .   His hand is cold , as if he will just do something wrong in the world . I feel his warmth , as if he is too beautiful , too , too intelligent to be alive , and too beautiful for me to be .   `` I love you so much , baby . ''   The tears stream down my face . He holds me to his chest , and tears run down his face .   `` I ... I wish I would give you where I was . ''   `` Let me . ''   ___   The next day , I found myself at home with my old father . He was smiling and sad , his blue eyes were bright . He was smiling , and looked at me in disappointment .   `` Thank you , baby . ''
This is my first submission from [ the most popular Reddit ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2h0c/wp_you_been_a_ass_a_new_life_that_is_always_changing_to_earth_your_story_is/dd7j ) , so why did n't you keep reading this ?    I walked through the store in a hurry to find some items . I found a box that looked like the type of package that would be taken from a shelf . But I could n't help but notice that I was wearing some kind of leather and wore some sort of leather .   There are n't many items like the store on the shelf . It 's more than a box . The kind of box that looks like a box , and a box that looks like a sort of box and a box that looks like the sort of box that looks like a box .   That box is definitely sealed and looks like something special . The box looks like something weird , but I do n't know how it looks . All the same , all all the same .   I picked it up , and tried to get it out before I could even close my eyes . I heard the box start to get closer , and the box starts to close itself .   There is another box in the box , in the box , where it turns out , but it seems that it also has something to think about .   I put it on the shelf and put it on the shelf , but my ears are ringing .   A few minutes later , I notice a box where the box is hidden , and the box holds a box . There is a box that looks like a box ; where the box is hidden ?   There are letters below it , written in a small , black font :   ** `` The box is sealed , of course I will make you wish you could use it forever . There will be a pattern of numbers that seem to manifest the number of a person . ''   I feel a sudden sense of shame creep over me , and I could n't help but feel this was wrong .   I hear a faint cough from the box , and then it was in a different way that would always help me .   I tried to speak but my throat was dry with tears .   `` That will kill me , '' I told myself , and then pushed the box back into the box . `` You may want to use it , but I can do nothing if you decide to use it anymore . You can do nothing and kill me in a way that you can be forever . I am a person who is also a person who is to use the luck to be used as a person to . ''   I looked around the store for clues , and walked up to the box and said , `` I 'm the person who should use it then . ''   The box was sealed as if it had been sealed from a box .  
To say , I have a mission to let the people know the cost of their lives . I ’ ve been saving the world and the lives of the people I saved .   I have spent years using my powers to save . I ’ ve tried to save the people too , but it doesn ’ t matter . The world doesn ’ t matter how long I think about it .   I ’ ve got one man I ’ ve spent my last moments trying to save . Killing his people is not to justify the matter . But I am also the one who can save the world . The old man thinks he ’ s to be able to do that unless he stays alive , I ’ m going to be able to save the people that go before him .   I didn ’ t . I just need to get me a gun .   It was a simple plan .   After work , I can ’ t help it . I ’ ve saved the people . I had to get out of food poisoning , and I wanted to get some sort of compensation .   One step has been an easy task . If time has already become a part of my plan , I might have to get his . I can just get out of my way at the end of the day .   I get out of my car and drive late . I pass myself , and my way towards the building . I walk into traffic and see a young lady in a blue dress .   “ Hey , stop getting here . What the hell are you doing here ? ”   As I look at the woman in the green dress , I notice that she ’ s wearing a black skirt that ’ s been dyed all over her body . One of her hands have black hair and black eyes .   “ Hey , are you there ? ” I ask .   “ No , don ’ t talk to me . I don ’ t know where you are , I ’ m here , and I was here for you. ”   She smiles and leaves in the black dress .   I get him out of the office and begin over the stairs , walking over to the man I had just walked in .   “ What do they do here ? ” I ask .   “ I ’ m here to keep you safe . We would have done this . We would have to be safe . I can ’ t take you anywhere . I can ’ t take you here. ”   I say my name .   “ Haha , I love you , ” he says .   “ Okay , let me guess . I ’ m here to stop them . Let ’ s go . We need to make sure there ’ s some time for you. ”   I open my eyes , and he ’ s gone . I ’ ve gone to my house to try to save the people once I ’ ve lost , but I don ’ t get enough sleep to make the people do this because I ’ m not sure where I am .   “ Do you remember the best you couldn ’ t do ? ”   “ No , that won ’ t hurt , but that never hurt the people . Please . I know you have to be okay . You will be okay . I ’ ll take your time to get you a gun . I have to make sure you ’ re okay. ”   I pull out my pistol , and go to his house , running . He left with me , so I will make sure I ’ ll keep safe , when I need a gun .   I go home , and turn on the tv , “ Hey , what are you doing here ? ”   I run , and start looking for clues to where he was going . I need a gun , and I don ’ t want a gun . I don ’ t want to get out of here , but I don ’ t want to be the hero that I ’ ve saved . 
`` Wait ... wait ... wait a minute ... ''   `` I ... wait ... wait ... wait a minute ... wait ... who said `` Do I remember him ? ''   Jeff looked into the eyes and saw the look he had with his eyes . A middle aged man , covered in blood , probably a baby .   `` The ... ''   Jeff 's heart sank to the floor and he heard a thud . The woman screamed `` Sir , this is a panic ! '' she called back . Jeff closed his eyes slowly and closed his eyes . He sat down and began to sob as he woke up . Suddenly , an older man , dressed in a black suit and a black suit .   `` What are you doing here ? ''   Jeff froze for a moment , and then he saw a man .   `` No , this is a panic ! You 're a terrorist ! '' he read .   A man walked by with a gun in his hand and ran downstairs and picked up a red coat .   He walked in and put it on and began to clean the mess . He turned to leave , and gave the homeless man a pat on the back .   The homeless man looked confused , and began to walk around the station and stopped as he walked around the corner .   He looked around again , and he saw a guy sitting on the table next to him .   `` Shit ! '' he said , grabbing a coffee from his flask . He looked around , and saw another man in blue , a gun .   `` This is n't a terrorist ! '' he asked , trying to get out of the way as if to get out of here .   The man stood up and ran downstairs . He went into the kitchen , and ran towards the door . He ran outside and to get out of here . He hit the door .   He turned to find a group of people . His head , face , and hands , he looked at the man .   `` So ? '' he asked , getting out of here .   `` Are you okay ? '' he asked , looking over there .   `` If I 'm ok ? ''   `` I 'm fine , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . '' he said , grabbing his bag , so he pulled out a small baggie .   `` But ... ''   `` But ... ''   `` What do you mean ... ''   `` Well ... ''   `` Well ... ''   `` What do you mean ... ''   `` Well ... do you mean that ... ''   `` I mean , do you mean that 's like ... uh ... that 's ... that is a terrorist or anything ? ''   `` That does n't sound very cool . We 've got a few of the time . ''   `` I do n't know ... ''   `` Right ... ''   `` Okay ! I 'm just going to let you go . Please , let me go ! ''   `` Okay ... I know you did n't mean that to be called ? ''   `` Yes , I mean ... I mean ... the answer is n't right . I 'm not sure what to say.. ''   `` Well ... guess what did the answer end ? ''   `` Well ... you know ... that sounds weird . But ... ''   `` Well ... of course . I was just going to help you . ''   `` Okay.. ''   `` Okay.. ''   The man looked into the eyes and saw a man wearing a white coat and a black suit with some sort of weird look on his face .   The man ran past them and into the room . He stopped as he walked back to the counter and took a seat across from him . He turned to see a small , blue man standing there . He looked at him and his eyes widened . He saw a woman in one of the men in red suit , and saw a sign written by his friend . He stood there .   `` What did you say back to me ? '' she asked , looking back at him .   The woman leaned back and said , `` I heard you say someone was going to help us , and did n't talk to you , but that 's okay , that 's not a terrorist . ''   `` Well ... '' Jeff said , raising another hand to block the man 's eyes . 
It seemed so pointless to think about it .   The sun was shining with the rays of a bright sun . As the sun was shining once more , it felt so surreal to think about it . A few more days , others would come rushing forward and join . Those few days would be spent getting stuck with thought and thoughts of it and what it left of it , and it would n't be able to stop doing it ; the stars would vanish as the light began to dim on them .   They reached the top of the sky and the stars would disappear under the stars . It would n't be long before the clouds would disappear . That 's what they said , not enough for them to know about it .   Then , the light grew and the light grew . It became closer to the sun and the light grew until it faded , but the stars grew stronger , growing stronger and stronger . The light became an eclipse on the outside with its light , illuminating the universe as it continued to focus . It was still in place , with all its colors , but it was still .   It was almost like a light .
`` The time has come . I 've checked it . ''   I thought for a second . The only person who knew who I was . She had a picture of me her husband . She had a glass of wine in her hand . She had a bottle of wine in her hand . She had been thinking about it . I looked down and saw that it was not very clear . I opened the door and realized instantly that I had n't yet seen the way I looked .   Five seconds later , there was a knock on my kitchen door .   `` What would you like ? ''   `` What would you like ? I did n't mean , what would you like ? I asked the door again .   `` I would . I have some information . ''   I was staring at the phone . It was just an old text message .   `` This will come . ''   After a few minutes , I asked the same question .   `` Why did they ask me ? ''   The man asked . `` Why is your money ? ''   `` They will ask me a question . ''   `` Why is your answer ? '' I asked .   `` Because ? ''   The man said , `` What ? ''
The letter was simple . From what appeared to be a large open envelope , it contained something else from somewhere else the inside which you had been holding on it . It had no ink for a long time , though , which I assumed was in fact an address .   In the way of looking at the top in front of me , I figured it was a joke . A statement that I no longer understood .   I had a letter addressed . I had the words *this could n't be the only one who 'd met me* . This was n't my soulmate , and I had to be sure .   I tried to read them . I had to take time of thinking to myself . I looked at them , and saw two of them in my hands , an old red-head , waiting for the letter that my heart would have been hit by something horrible . The letters were a simple letter , with only one word . Even the letter was a simple letter , with a red sticker , and a red sticker .   At first , it was hard to explain . But it was a tiny letter from a distant future , and a half-full letter . With the other word , I read it .   I did n't have to talk to someone .   I figured this was a joke . They said that I was n't alone .   I had n't really been to talk .   I almost knew that I should n't speak to them . I never did . I did n't know that you would .   So , I stood up , and walked off to the door .
`` We do n't have time for conversation , '' I said to my friend , placing my hand on his shoulder .   `` Do n't kill us , '' he said as I pulled my handgun from his hands . He started to sob again , trying to reassure me .   `` I do n't have time for this , '' I said , as I pulled the trigger . Two shots I 'd had fired .   `` If you do n't shoot enough , '' he said firmly . `` I ca n't think . I ca n't- ''   `` Neither do you . I do n't have time for this . I tried to kill myself , but I ca n't believe it . I even have time for this . ''   `` What ? '' I stammered , trying to get a word out of his mouth .   `` I tried to kill myself , anyway . Why do you do what you need ? I do n't even have time to think about it . '' He said as he walked away .   `` Why do you have to kill me ? What is wrong with this ? Why do you have to kill me ? '' I asked , hoping to get some answers away .   `` I do n't . I do n't have time for this . I just want to kill myself . If you will , then I will kill you . If you do n't kill me , then I can you die . ''   He reached into my jacket pocket . I closed fire again , trying to figure out where it was . I waited for some answer , but it did n't budge .   There was a flash of light , and then the entire school was gone .

( Warning Warning : I 'm an idiot for writing stories , but I 'm not sure which is true or it 's just that you had too many bad dreams for . )   I had n't changed so much though . I did n't change so much . I did n't change so much . I changed so much .   When I was young , my skin had become dark .   My hair was the same , everything seemed to be gone . It was when I started to wear clothes .   The people around me seemed to think that they were going to have to wear shoes . I was n't meant to be used by my parents , I was meant to be used by my parents . They thought I was supposed to be used by my parents .   I moved on . I moved on . I made sure to wear shoes in the day . The day I started to sweat and sweat and the days started pouring .   It was n't long before I began to believe that people were n't going to wear shoes .   That 's when I realized why I took them .   I had gone to the store in the morning and I decided , as soon as they were gone , I did n't really like this . I had to change so much , I did n't even want to be used anymore .   I was meant to be used by my parents . I was meant to be used .   I was told that I would be used again . The fact that I was used by my parents had become very powerful without losing a shoe . I laughed , and suddenly I knew that they were going to do something differently .   I was told that I would live in some way that I could survive . But they were going to have to lose a shoe . I did n't want to be used again .   My parents are going to keep making me wear shoes too . I do n't know why . They do n't know anymore .   I 'm supposed to be used again . I 'm supposed to be used again . They want to know what I wanted .   I wish they could forget everything that they left .   I wish I could disappear . That I am used again .   This day is different .   I made sure to keep my shoe , I should n't have stayed put .   I can n't .
Afterward day of the last human empire , Rond knew the answer . A city that never existed in the war . The population of human races could not be able to change , simply , they would not become human .   & nbsp ;   `` There 's no way you can convince me that this is a game , more than a concept . This is a game . ''   & nbsp ;   Some years later two of Rond 's elite forces found their way to the war horizon of this city , and Rond 's forces arrived . Rond 's armies were not of a doubt , but of the city that wanted to be , and the next thing Rond knew , Rond 's forces were a mere pawn , the world could not comprehend , and the whole thing wanted to be .   & nbsp ;   `` If only you left me for this game , where do you want to go ? ''   & nbsp ;   `` I know because maybe I do n't want to go , or my way to the war . '' Rond tried to focus his attention , but Rond was unable to discern the rest of the army . Even if nothing else , the army was too far to begin . A group of the soldiers decided to leave , and that their armor would be much stronger to do .   & nbsp ;   Rond had never once fought back , of course . The entire city had been destroyed by the war , the only remaining human being alive , and at full fled to the war horizon .   & nbsp ;   Rond was not going to go through the war , but on this day of the last human colonies , only after all did they have . He had a reason for the war , for that they knew he had to go out , and because after all , they had no option to .   & nbsp ;   *They know that this game is not yours . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that at the time , they know that every time they do you see a human , or two , you will see their entire cities . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they know that their entire city is yours . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that*   *They knew that their lives would not be mine . * *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they know that this place is ours . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they know that they can not live . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that as a consequence , they know that they know that their next war is yours . *   *They know their true origins , but They know that they know that they have become the rulers of all countries . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that as a consequence , they know that their greatest ally will destroy their land . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they know that what they know is ours . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they have become the power of their world , but they know that they do n't know that they know that their last war is ours . *   & nbsp ;   *You know that , the city is ours . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they try to take control of their world , but one man will tell that they are n't being protected . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they know that their people know that they are . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they know that all they know is that they know that their greatest ally is theirs . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that they know that their greatest ally is yours . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that everything is yours . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that every man will know that they will have the power of their lives , but they know that they know that those of us who know that their greatest ally is yours . *   & nbsp ;   *They know that in the war , the war is theirs . * 
I watched her walk through the dark , grassy path at the end of the clearing . The forest was empty and nothing was better about it than the usual shade that shone through the leaves . The sunlight had been painted over the horizon , it seemed so dark that everything else was lit . I could feel its shadow against my palm .   The ground beneath me was wet and wet . The grass was too hard to stay alive . I could sense the air rushing with each step . The blackness of the forest was too clear . I could feel the heat around me . I could feel the wetness around me . I could feel myself becoming more aware of her presence . A heartbeat raced through my head as the grass began to turn dry , and I could feel my hand starting to turn stiff , as if I had been trapped on the ground .   The car pulled away . I knew this must be a mistake . I had to stop , but I could see nothing . I was going to die . I could hear the sound of her voice in my ear , the sound of her voice , the sound of her voice . I pulled the trigger as fast as I could , and I was pushed forward . She was gone .   I must have seen her . My body moved and moved and I did the only thing left . I wanted to tell her . Every moment was a blur , and I was numb . I wanted to tell her . I wanted to tell her . I wanted to tell her I wanted to tell her .   She walked closer . I could feel her hand coming to hug me . I could feel her face . It was so cold and ... It was so cold , so cold that I could n't sit .   I could feel her hand touch me . I stared at her . Then she kissed me . I could feel her hand kiss me .   Her hand touched mine .   I knew my heart heart was pounding . I could feel her hand reaching into mine .
A voice came through the door . It was one of the greatest minds I had ever encountered .   `` Why ? '' I asked as an elderly man approached me , his eyes rolling over .   `` What did you do ? '' He asked , already frowning . `` I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I did n't say anything . ''   `` That 's okay . '' I replied . `` I 'm afraid you tried to come in with me . ''   `` What do you mean ? ? ''   `` I do n't know . I ... I do n't know . ''   `` You really do n't really understand . '' He smiled , but I was too preoccupied with this .   He sighed and nodded quickly . `` So what do you ... do n't you understand ? ''   I laughed , my face turned white .   `` I 'm just saying , I 'm just saying it , why is n't you ? ''   `` Because I 'm just saying it . ''   `` Why do you do n't understand ? I do n't understand . I do n't understand . I understand . I understand . I understand . ''   He handed me the letter . I read it . I was so interested in the situation . I did n't see him through it .   `` I told you to go . I 'm just saying it 's ok . You 're just saying it 's fine . '' He shrugged , and stepped away .   A man walked out , walked out , and looked at me with confusion .   `` Do n't know what to do . Why does it matter ? ''   `` Because everyone can care . '' I said . `` Why do you want this ? How do I understand ? ''   `` Because you are , but you 're the one who can understand . '' He turned back to his computer . Everyone had said it 's fine .   I laughed . `` I do n't understand . '' I said as I looked at the letter .   `` Because I 'm just saying it 's not supposed to be okay . I -- ''   `` You 're not supposed to know . You just have to understand . And you 're just a *world* . ''   There was a sudden silence .   `` What does this mean ? That 's not what you have to do without me . ''   There was a slight rustle , and in the end there was a rustle .   I looked at the letter .   A moment later I was in front of the letter .   `` You 're not supposed to understand . '' My smile widened , and I grinned . `` Because I 'm just saying it 's fine . ''
I was n't listening now that I had a visitor . Just tired of having my own thoughts of having a stranger , but I had to try and take a seat . Usually there was an empty spot that seemed to be somewhere in the middle of nowhere , but not something there . It was more than a corner of the bar . A small wooden stool made of small wooden boards and a small tattered umbrella that overlooked the seat itself . A bottle of scumbagot . The old man left no use , just one . More than one drink . More than one drink .   He had a peculiar look on my face . Short and bald . No need to hide his face . He sat down upon a table , and another drink . I never spoke . For a few seconds , he spoke .   `` I ca n't believe , '' he said , `` but it 's going to happen . I do n't know how you might see this , but you 're trying to see what you 've seen . How are you feeling ? ''   I was n't prepared to answer her question , I already knew he had been trying to talk to me when her gaze was fixed on him . She looked at me like a fool , and then smiled at me .   `` That 's lovely , '' I said . `` Is she alright ? ''   `` I know . She does . She 's always good friends . You 're lucky to have a dark skin , and you know who you are on the wrong side . ''   He began scribbling . I could n't believe it . I did n't know what he said . I just stared at him curiously , confused . He could n't help but laugh .   `` And she 's afraid . '' he said .   There was a hint of confidence in his voice .   I could n't help but chuckle . I felt fear . It was an emotion of sadness , fear , sadness . I could n't help but laugh , and I was n't sure . I knew his eyes were staring at me , and I could n't help but laugh .   He looked at me then , and then back at me . He looked at me , and then at me .   `` I know . We 've been friends for over 50 years now , and I know I know ... I know when I was a kid . I know all about you and I know how you feel . ''   He looked at me , and then at me . His eyes widened .   `` He 's good . He 's good . You 're good , and I know better . ''   He felt sad , and his drink was gone .   I laughed a bit , and I just smiled .   He laughed again . `` That 's fine . Did you realize my feelings ? ''   I looked at his eyes . I had a certain urge to laugh .   `` I know . I know . '' He said between laughs . `` I know . '' He held his hands up . The old man was in front of me , and a small black man in a grey suit walked over to me .   This man was n't there . He was there for me , and I knew he was alone for me . He was there for me . I knew I was in this world , and I knew . He was there for me . And he was there for me .   I had no idea where I was going . I knew that he was there for me . I knew that he was there for me , so I did n't know where I was going . I did n't know how he was doing things , but I knew what I was doing . He was there for me , and I did n't know what I was doing for him .   He said that I was there for me , and I knew he was there , and I knew he would be there for me . I knew he had been there for me . I knew everything about him , and I knew there was something I had never seen before . I knew he was there for me . And so I waited . He was there for me to tell his story . He looked at me , and then he smiled and said , `` I know . ''   I stared back at him again . He grinned and frowned . I knew what his name was up to .   `` Is that what you saw ? ''   I shrugged . I was there for him .   The old man was smiling again , and what felt like years . He looked at me like a child . I knew I
`` What 's wrong with you ? '' the old gods asked , looking at me with a look of fear .   `` I wish I could touch you . '' the old gods said , his voice trembling , `` but I 've been hoping you 'll get the message back ! ''   The old Gods nodded , `` You never did . ''   `` But you *are* alive . The next day , I would have to go home and be gone . I would have to go home . '' I said , trying to remember what they meant .   We both stood up and looked at each other in silence , `` why 're you doing this ? '' the younger ones asked .   The younger ones walked in , arms crossed from each other . `` Why are you doing this ? ''   `` I 've said it , but I 've written it . Do you realize what I 'm doing ? Do you realize what I 'm doing ? '' the old gods asked me , looking at me with a look of confusion . `` I was so tired . I 'm just tired . I 've asked you to come back . ''   The younger gods looked back up at me with confusion , `` why do you want to leave ? ''   `` Why are you doing this ? '' the younger gods asked , `` Why are you telling me that ? Is that the other gods on your planet ? ''   `` I 'm the one here , '' the old gods said , not showing it anywhere else . `` You just created planets . ''   The younger ones nodded and left . `` You know , a planet that you want to be inhabited with . You want to get a place in your garden , and you do n't have to be so happy in your life . ''   Just then , two beings walked out of the house and sat down .
The two of them were watching , with their eyes locked , tears forming in their eyes as the two of them ran .   `` Are you okay ? ! How are you all okay ? ! You 're okay ? ! ''   They were on the brink of death with their friends at the end of the day , and two of them were holding hands to both sides . The two 's eyes were wide and wide , and then they were holding hands , trying to escape his fate . A hand grabbed him by the chin , and he fell , unconscious , dead , both buried alive . The two watched , confused , dumbfounded , and silently sobbed .   `` I 'll go home , '' the two shared a firm handshake , with each other , with the same sadness . The two nodded , and then disappeared .  
God damn it , I hate this place . I hate this place . I hate this place .   I 'm never so goddamn stupid , I just want to have a bad day . I hate this place . Why ca n't I love this place ? I hate this place . For every reason I am n't so stupid . I hate this place from this place to this place . It is just abandoned . The sun , the only shade in the world , is starting to show signs of life left .   It 's my fault , I have to do it . I ca n't do it any more . I ca n't even do it . This place is never empty . All I ever wanted is an old guy . I hate this place .   It 's a lovely place . I enjoy the whole damn place . I hate this place . But this place is still shitty . There 's nothing else to do . There 's light here , there 's more to the bathroom than the one . It 's just something to do .   I 'm not taking off yet . I 'm just like this . All I want is the perfect spot . I 'm going to be the perfect spot .   `` Alright then . I need to get some clothes from this place . '' I say . Now that they know why they do n't sell this place of hers .   I 'm not saying this . `` Yeah well maybe you 'll just give it up . ''   I stop to smile and continue . `` Alright then . ''   I reach up and touch the smooth surface . When I look up I see it . Where 's my job ? Am I going to go ? This place is a wonderful place . Every place I 've ever created , every place I 've ever created , every place I 've ever created is perfect . There 's no way this place really works .   I push open my eyes and watch the door slowly open and I hear nothing there . The one thing I can do is read my mind as to how big the apartment is in . I have to ask my heart , remember this place , remember how beautiful this place was today . I 'm going to get some fresh air , and that 's where the sun is going . I take a deep breath and look at my heart , the one I 've ever created . This place is amazing . I turn around and walk back down the street , back to my apartment . I recognize this place . This place is not mine . Where is my soul ?   I turn around and see the building . But what if this place is perfect place ? He looks so happy , I just want revenge . I have this place . I look at him . I give him the time to come to this place .   `` Okay , what 's your problem with this place ? ''   `` This place is perfect . I 'm here to fulfill my quota . ''   He looks at me and says , `` Okay , fine . Come on . I 've got a heart ... ''   I walk out of the place .   As I walk through the door I see the city . All of it . No way of knowing .   `` Okay that one . '' I say . `` Take it away . ''
I ’ ve had a lot of time .   I hadn ’ t been a normal man for 10 years , and I ’ ve never been a normal man . But I was the one that had a lot of time .   I ’ ve never even seen him before , on the street in my life . I guess it wasn ’ t an easy job , a job worth fighting , living , and living . But I haven ’ t seen him since that day .   Ever since the first time I had seen him at the park , I could see his eyes as he wore a mask ! I got scared , and I feared him for the chance to look at me .   This man was a businessman every day . He started to walk , shouting at me , cursing me for the benefit of myself . My face had changed from disappointment . And he followed suit .   I had been out of the house for 3 years . I had to be careful . I had to work , I had to do . I could take the money when I picked up my revolver . In the first place , I got bored , and I began to get nervous , as I was about to walk . I was about to leave the park when I asked him to follow suit or to follow suit in my footsteps . He said he didn ’ t want to happen , I just let him take the gun . I got in my car to go see my neighbor , who had just walked into his car .   “ Please listen ! ” he didn ’ t respond ; neither did he .   He turned his flashlight into a light , and started to move around in his direction . I felt a tug on my right leg . I began to move , and I don ’ t know what exactly I ’ d told him . I just didn ’ t know what it would be . As I approached I felt nothing . My left hand moved over the ground . I tried to focus on his hand , but there was no noise . I almost drowned out that noise . It felt like it was just a glitch in my hand . I felt myself being pulled to the floor . I felt my heart beat beat , but I couldn ’ t bring myself to move with it .   “ God don ’ t you remember me ? ” he said , in a voice I hadn ’ t heard , and I would never be back . I didn ’ t want to hear him speaking , or what to say . I simply couldn ’ t . I was not sure if I ’ d heard something , but I couldn ’ t .   “ I am not . I ’ m dead . I ’ ve died . I am not dead . I am not dead . And yet I don ’ t know who you are and why you are . This is not your world .   I dropped my rifle , and my feet sank as I ran . I saw my neighbor , who had been standing by the door , holding the gun close . I didn ’ t notice them .   I stared at them , my eyes were wide . The man had said nothing to me . He continued , “ I ’ m not dead . I ’ m dead . And you have someone to live with . I will be dead . I will be dead .  
`` I 'll be leaving in a week . ''   I looked at the man , who was n't looking much like me at all . He had a long , big beard , that had taken over long years of his life . He really could n't believe that my work was over .   `` I do n't think so , '' he said . `` That 's why I 'm here today . ''   `` No one knows what I 'm hoping , '' I said . `` All they know is that you can really show me the ropes . ''   He had his face in his hands . His face was bright red and he did n't have a face . There was a deep , deep brown eyes that had n't seen for centuries . His big , brown head , was brown . There was a scar on his forehead .   I pulled my collar sleeve back to reveal my business shirt .   I could n't help but shudder .   `` I was n't gon na say it again . ''   He stared in disbelief with a hint of a grin in his eyes . He 'd known for long since I did .   `` I 'll go the next day . ''   I smiled and walked back to my car .   -- -   `` You 're a young lad , '' he breathed a sigh .   He made his way to the front and stood beside me , his pale face glowing with fear . He stopped and looked up and down at me .   We opened the door to the house and walked in .   `` Wh-what the hell is up with you anyways ? ''   `` You ... you 're a great boy , '' he said . `` You should be proud of me , '' he said .   He looked confused . He picked up his phone and picked it up .   `` Why ? '' he asked .   `` You- ''   `` What ? What- ''   `` I did n't know ! ''   `` How ? ''   `` All you know is you 're right . I know . You wo n't believe me tonight . I know . ''   I held his hand . My heart began racing again .   `` You ... you ... you died that day ! ''   `` You were right ! ''   `` Alright , so I should have been more careful . ''   The man sat down and held up his hand .   `` I 'm not going . ''   `` No . Yes . Look , I know I should have been more careful than you . I do n't want to . ''   `` I 'm going to be a great young lad . ''   I saw him go back to his car . He got excited to look at me .   `` But why does what you do ? ''   I smiled .   `` Because you know . You know . I know , I know . ''   He looked down at his phone . It was n't there .   `` I can tell . ''
*You know I 'm so tired of this job , but this is too much for me*   As I continued to walk to work , I went over to the boss . He was too late to work , he just had to work on my work . The boss put me down and I left the office , a cubicle rung , a cat rung , a dog rung and a dog rung back and down his path . I could n't take it anymore , though . I did n't have to , I just had to write now or else I might have finished lunch . I went to try to cut him off , but instead it stopped . I could n't feel my hands , but I could see the dog running down the stairwell and down the stairwell .   Instead of running in the wind for help , I decided to get used to it . I put it on the ground and headed out the door . I made my way to my apartment , it was empty save for a handful of other people outside . I decided to wait for someone to come here to help me out and wait . I walked downstairs and took out my laptop . I went to the one who was sitting , the one who grabbed my laptop and texted me , `` Hey there ! You 're here ! ''   The cat ran to the phone and sent me three messages to start the job . I started to panic when I heard a few words . `` You fucking left it ! ''   `` That 's OK , let 's get the fuck out of here . ''   She then looked at me and then down the stairs . `` You 're here for some reason , that 's what I did all day . That 's why I made it here . ''   `` We did it ! You are here for something '' I said , feeling extremely ashamed . `` We do n't know why ! You did it ! You know what I did ! I was here for a reason ! You 're here for something special ! You 're here for something special . I went to the basement and there you came , the next person who was here a few years ago . I did n't want to look like you ! ''   `` You 're here for something special , you would n't do that today , he 's here for something special , and then they 've all been doing it . ''   `` I know , I have something special for you . If he does n't make this decision , I 'll have to talk to you both . ''   `` That 's right , but let 's do this . '' I replied , looking at the computer screen . It was just typing , the exact same thing I had just done .   *Your boss has been doing this for so long , and you deserve to be here for something special*   I put back my laptop , trying to turn the page on . Something was wrong . I checked the page , another email , another book , another book , another book , another book , another book , another book , another book . That seems familiar , but I could n't remember what to say next . I heard a faint clicking sound coming from my back . I dropped to my knees and looked around . I saw myself in a room , one of my coworkers was looking at me , in a panic , and after realizing it was n't there . I saw a large black , dark room , a small room with a small number on it , waiting for me to come in . I turned the light on and tried to see if there was anything special about it , yet here I was , standing staring at the bed . I could n't see myself , but I stared at it . I was lying on the bed . The floor was covered in cloth , lying there on the bed . I stood there , rubbing my head , looking at the ceiling . I could n't see the ceiling , and felt the warmth of the lamp and how I did n't know how I had gotten here . But I was still sitting at this bed , slowly eating my pills . I began to focus , thinking about what I had done , when I heard a faint voice .   *I am so tired of this job*   I looked around , I realized I was alone . How was my life going on ? I had to be here for so long . I was in a different room now , and was completely alone . I had to start thinking about what I had done , I had to go home .
`` Alright , now lets go of this little group of friends so I 'll let 's go find out what you want . ''   The head of the older man 's head snapped back and forth in the same way he always did when the crowd got up and put in the same direction he usually did when the party moved onto their own or some other poor schoolyard .   `` Then , there 's the big deal , you got ta know what the public wants . ''   The old man then chuckled and started walking towards the exit of the building for the first time in the whole week . He was a bit too sure , but he gave the kid a quick shove , then turned and left . He was starting to get suspicious of the older man , as if he was a little curious .   `` What you 're doing doing , '' began another guy , as if he was some sort of prank he was playing . He then went into a deep brown , and then turned and left . `` I 'm staying here for about the weekend . ''   The kid next to him took off his jacket , and went to the bathroom . When he woke up , it was like he had a long day , the whole way with the blonde and the blonde butlers around the waist . `` Fuck you , you do n't have a problem , '' he muttered as he climbed out of the shower and turned off the new pair .   `` No problem , '' said the old man with a smile .
`` Are you ready to take the crown ? '' A voice called as she walked into her room . Her father gave a gentle cough as he moved towards the door .   `` I 'm ready for your arrival , '' the father said as he took the crown and continued to push open the door revealing a long hallway ahead .   `` ... If you are ready to hear that , what about the royal family ? '' The father asked as the door locked behind him . `` We 'll go talk about how little they have gained as far as possible so that if the court has their king , and you will be very lucky to see your grand family . ''   `` As far as I know , '' she said as he walked in . `` ... and as far as I know , I 've seen all of them coming here . ''   They sat in silence , a mixture of shock and horror and surprise on their faces .   `` If they can see the royal family , I 'd prefer to , '' the father said as he led the other men inside , `` what about them already ? What about them to do when they 've got their king ? ''   `` Well I 've seen them coming here , '' the father responded as he grabbed the crown and pulled it over to him .   `` They might have taken the crown and the crown and the body they were meant to go . ''   The father 's eyes went wide at the sight , and he knew that he had the wrong plan .   `` Well , now that I 'll talk . '' The father stated as he turned the hallway into a hallway . `` I think it 'll be time to do it . ''   `` What about that ? '' The father said as he handed the crown the crown .   `` You know , '' the father said as he walked out , the most menacing of the people he 'd ever encountered .   The father went in and hugged the child , smiling .   The father stayed walking the hall and took his hand and took it in the man 's neck .   
`` What is it ? ! '' I yelled in a soft , flat voice of exasperation .   `` I 'm serious , I did n't even get a warrant , but I 'm not going to want to do it , '' the prosecutor said . He looked around , eyes wide from side to side . This trial had an un-familiar feeling , but to no avail . `` I 'm afraid it 's to be the last time I 'm here , I hope you 've heard of me , sir . I 've been feeling a lot lately . '' A few minutes passed , and the prosecutor became aware of the statement .   `` I 've been feeling a bit uneasy lately . Have n't been nice . I was n't going to be here to help your customers with anything I could do . I 've been feeling a lot lately . ''   `` I 've been feeling a lot lately , '' I replied . `` And I thought I got in trouble , so I just do n't want to do it . '' I started to walk away , toward the end of the hall .   The prosecutor followed me , and I looked around . I was n't worried for him to come come out . He was n't going to do it for me , not a lot . I was n't going to do it for him , either , but I was n't going to do it for me .   What was this ? ... I stood there , contemplating my decision . What the hell was this ? I looked around , but see nobody in the courtroom . Everyone was looking at me , wide arms , one look like I was n't going to have to .   `` This is a trial for the last time , '' I whispered , and heard my voice go into my ear to my ear .   `` You 're not going to believe that , '' the prosecutor said . `` You 're going to believe that , not as you are . ''   I looked at the lawyer , who had been trying to find a way to talk to me . All right , being able to speak , I stood there , breathing , and finally felt my voice . I could n't understand who I was , or what was going on . This was a test for me .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I muttered . `` We do n't believe that this trial is much worse than this , but since it has so much greater difficulty , it certainly is n't a thing to explain , '' I confessed .   `` How 's this supposed to be ? '' I asked .   `` Nothing . This is n't a thing , '' he replied . `` Do you believe that ? ''   `` How did you expect to be a lawyer ? '' I asked , still puzzled .   `` It 's simply a tool of my own , '' I said , trying to get the answer out , `` but the defendant ... is *not* a murderer . He would just let me have the same punishment . He would have cried for longer , so he would have cried for longer , but , more recently , he 's gone . ''   `` Please , you know what you want , '' he began .   `` *No one ever believes me . This is a story of my own , '' I clarified , before moving back to the courtroom .   `` You tell me what I want , '' he continued , as though he were going to calm his tone . `` I want to show this , I want to show it to you . ''   My heart hurt , and I glanced back at the witness .   `` Now , '' I interjected . `` Now , your trial is no longer an issue ... '' I began to tell the lie . The prosecutor kept his voice calm and slightly fearful . `` There 's a limit on this , '' he reasoned . He still had n't lost his train of thought . `` One thing , '' he replied . I tried to sound scared . `` And not two , '' he said .   I looked at him . `` It was n't my fault , '' I said .
`` Fuck you ! '' Another round of security guards yelled out .   `` Fuck you ! ! ''   The guard slammed the door down .   `` No ! '' he hissed back . With a low voice he shouted , `` I 'm alive , I do n't think so ! ''   `` The thing is , I 'm not fucking alive ! ''   `` I 'm alive ! ''   `` Fuck it ! ''   `` Fuck you ! And do n't fuck me ! ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` Did you hear this ?

''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   He turned , ran towards his desk . A man , dressed in black stepped into the office . He wore a simple white uniform and took off his pants . The man started talking , `` fuck you ! ''   ** '' The president , please ! `` **   `` Fuck you ! '' he said . `` Fuck you ! ''   `` Fuck you ! ''   ** '' Fuck you ! `` **   `` Fuck you ! Fuck you ! ''   He lifted his head , and the President was standing on his desk in the doorway .   ** '' Fuck you ! `` **   `` Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Fuck you ! ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   `` Fuck you ! '' He shouted .   * '' Look , I told you ! `` * he said .   `` Fuck you !

He sat on the grass of the city , with his face of doom as he watched the clouds rise from the sky . The clouds were beautiful , and the sky was thick . From the horizon , the clouds grew , and the sky became blue . The sky had been covered in an awful blue sky . In the sky , a black cloud blew out a cloud of clouds . He could see it , and a sound came from the clouds . The clouds began to glow , and the sky dispersed into hundreds of thousands of stars , hundreds of years ago , with clouds of clouds .   And then , suddenly , he realised the stars were red , and he was the person beside him . He called out to someone else , who sounded happy .   `` May I ask you what will you think , honey ? ''   `` Yes , honey . ''   `` I 'll give you some peace . ''   -- -   'Where 's I ? '   `` You can save me , honey , ''   `` Have you ever had someone else like you ? ''   `` No , honey , I 've never met someone like you ! '' 
The teacher could ’ ve chosen , in his defense . He had always wanted to get the best grades and start the school . Everything was perfect . He wanted his own life . All the kids were happy . Everyone had been happy . Everyone had looked at him with awe . No one cared . Not anymore . He was perfect . It was perfect . Everything else was perfect . There was always a perfect perfect voice . A perfect voice that he would never love .   “ No wait . No wait , it ’ s not stupid . I don ’ t know why I ’ m here . I don ’ t know why. ”   “ But I was just there and I must have forgotten all the things I was taught ! ”   “ You ’ re just too stupid to learn anything from me ! ”   “ Are you saying you ’ re not going to want me to learn something to learn from you ? ”   “ You do n't know because why you ’ re here . I can ’ t even remember that anymore , if you weren ’ t going to learn something to learn from me , you came from the school before . You just have to learn something from me . I do n't know why I ’ m here , but it 's not the way you treat me . I just do n't know why I have to learn something to learn from me . I never have to learn anything , and I just did n't have to learn anything from you. ”   “ I don ’ t know if I do , I can get you to learn something so I ’ ve learned something so I can teach something from you. ”   The teacher looked at him . He was still still focused . “ What ? ”   “ I know , but I don ’ t know . I have to learn something so I can learn from you. ”   “ It ’ s not , because I want to learn something ! ”   “ But what would you do for me ? Why ? ! ! ”   “ Because I still have my own school , and I do n't know why I want to learn anything but to learn something simple . I am the only one who can teach me anything about me . I am so happy . I can learn something to teach a lesson about me , in the same way you used to. ”   The teacher looked at him . “ Are you in high school ? You don ’ t know why you are here ? I refuse . It will only be a matter of time when I learn to learn what you got . I will teach you something , anything you want . I can learn something , anything to teach you , anything to teach you. ”   “ Because I had nothing to teach you , I am not going to learn anything to teach you , I am not going to learn something for you to learn . I do n't have to learn anything , but I am an idiot . I ’ m not going to learn anything . I ’ m going to learn something to teach. ”   “ How will I learn ? How will I learn everything from you ? How will I learn ? I could learn more about you . I can learn anything about you , and learn more to teach . That was what I learned to teach about me . I am going to learn something from you . I can learn every lesson I need . I ’ m going to learn the lesson , I can learn everything from you . I can learn everything and learn what you learned , and everyone I know is going to learn about me. ”   The teacher looked up to him and said , “ So what would you learn ? Did you learn things to teach ? ! ”   “ You will learn something so simple I use magic . You want a lesson to teach from me. ”   “ You will learn something I learn about me , and I can teach my own things in a way that you learn . If you learn everything from me , you will learn something that I can learn from you , I can learn from you or learn . If you learn anything , I can learn how to learn that . I can learn anything , because that *thing* changes me , so it takes me a lot of time to learn something to learn from them that I can teach it back , but the lessons about me will learn the lesson . You will learn something that I can learn from you , but I will learn something . A lesson will teach you , and it will teach you something to learn and
At first i thought the universe was a little better . So i was a little more alive and realized i was pretty happy to go in with something else . It was as if i made it , and i was an amazing person for everything .   I was born with no memory of being a super and i am in a very small town , there is n't any traffic anymore . You can see everything except you , a tall man with a wispy and white hair and a black dress . He wears a suit , his hair is more gold . He has a gun and his clothes are much nicer . His teeth were made of the exact same color , with a blue tint on it . He has a gun and a gun on it right .   I went to my shop . I decided we should have been very careful . It was just one of the bigger parties in the world ; we were not going to get the money . He also called me a super and I think no one should mention the words and everything . I go to a coffee shop , grab a cup and walk over .   It was amazing , but I was good at it .   I felt a lot like what happened . A lot of fun started by the time I had given up . It was n't hard to explain : that I was just a regular person , but it was n't normal . He laughed at me and told me what I did .   *The government*   I went into an alley , put my hands on the counter and go back to walking over , but not too different . I got in and went to the middle . It looked like it was just a regular person . Then again a man with a red mask on his hand walked over on it . The man said he was going to ask for a drink and a drink . Then he asked for his drink . Then it started to spill out .   *The government*   I wanted to go to my shop and explain how my government was causing people to believe it . The man said he was being honest and , we would have been very close this far . We decided to tell our secret so he did n't like to say that , and then he said `` I ca n't believe that he is . I ca n't believe it . Whatever happened to him . ''   *The government*   I walked up to the man and said `` What the fuck ? ! ''   He looked at me skeptically in my face . `` It 's been three years since we touched the ground . We always wanted to know what happened , when we met the other man . It was n't so weird . We were so excited that he was going to be okay . ''   `` What the hell happened ? ''   `` There were two in the country , and there was some people in the town . They could n't really believe it . ''   `` So , what the fuck is going on ? ''   `` Its been three years since the US happened . I was a real person . Like a human being . ''   I got up and walked over to the man . He was n't so much older than me and he was just a regular person . I asked him how he was going to die and he said that he had to move out of here . ''   He looked at me for a moment and then said `` I need to say something , I need to say ? ''   `` Dude , I need to say something . ''   `` Okay , I need to say something . ''   `` Okay . Come on . I need to run out of here . ''   `` We 'll move on . ''   `` Okay . That 's it . ''   I walked over to the guy and said `` I 'm going to be back to home for a while . ''   At the time I looked around , thinking of not really caring about the people we were talking about .   I said `` I 'm going to do something , and I 'm going to spend much time getting ready to do something . ''   The man looked at me strangely and said `` You know ? ''   *The government*   `` Okay . ''   *The government*   I walked over to the man and said `` Do you know how hard we 're going to keep it all ? ''   `` If I get to do something I keep forgetting about our lives . I want to become a superpowers . I want to know what happens to the world .
The last thing I remember was his face was a young red stain . He said that he was in the trenches after I told him that I was n't going to die . I smiled and said , `` Thank you , my love .   He said , `` It 's okay . I hope you 're so lonely . ''   He said , `` Maybe it 's ... Maybe it 's possible . ''   I looked at him , and I shook my head . He looked at me , not knowing what I was seeing . He nodded , not saying anything , but in a hushed voice , `` You were right . I was so lonely . I found them in my arms . They said no . Maybe it 's because he 's the one who did n't want to die . I told you about my love . ''   He smiled , `` That 's a good word . But I could n't think of it . ''   There were tears forming in my eyes , `` That 's the last time you met me , '' he said , `` how much of a good word I have . ''   I looked at him , but I remember that I could n't say anything , `` I fought you . I fought you . I fought you . I fought you . And I had ... And I wanted ... And I held you . I thought of it . I thought of it . I thought ... and I saw you . I thought of myself . I remember . I thought of myself ... and I remembered you , again . ''   I could n't believe I was dead , but I was just so broken , so broken .   I looked back at the letter , then back at the letter , still looking at it . I remembered my love . I smiled . It was n't a bad word anymore .   I stared at the letter . It was a sad letter . I nodded , and said , `` Do n't you understand ? ''   I knew . I looked at it , and stared at it , `` I miss you too . ''   It was n't a bad word anymore .
`` The inmate . ''   `` Yeah , that 's right . The prison is a prisoner now ! The Prisoner 's condemned can not be dead , not too many people have been able to make a living life . ''   `` No . ''   `` You say that you 've been convicted and killed by the rest of the week . ''   `` Because I killed two people ! ''   `` Dude , I 'm not a prisoner ! You 're a prisoner ! ''   `` What ? And why do n't you kill four bodies ? ''   `` That 's right ! I 'm not a prisoner ! Do n't you have any idea why the prison is on the other side ! ''   `` I 'm not a prisoner ! ''   `` I 'm serious ! Why are n't you dead ? ! ''   `` I 'm a prisoner ! ''   `` Like you did the other day ! ''   `` Dude ! Hey . I 'm still here ! ''   `` Yeah ! You do n't have shit like this . But ... I 'm not a prisoner . And I ... ''   `` Yeah ... ''   `` So you die ? Where did you even go ? ''   `` I 'm actually a prisoner ! ''   `` I 'm out of here ! Hey , man ! That 's right ! I 'm saying that I 'm here . But I do n't believe in your own judgement ! ''   `` Hey , man , you 're one of us , but you are one of us and they 're wrong ! ''   `` I 'm pretty sure you 're right ? ''   `` I 'm a prisoner ! ``   `` Like you did the other day ! I 'll see you soon enough ! I 'm still here ! You 're not even any prisoner ! ''   `` I 'm a prisoner ! I 'm here ! ''   `` Dude , that 's alright ! ``   `` Well , I do n't know where you 're going ! That 's right ! Also , I do n't get mad ! ! In fact , I 'm *crazy* . But I 'm gon na watch this and then I get your cell , and then I can sit there ! ''
“ Please , let me help you. ”   “ NO ! I do n't think we can hear it. ”   The two soldiers paused in their seat . One of the soldiers picked another soldier up and began walking away from the window .   “ O-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-O-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-n-N , N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N .

The day was no longer like he 'd been in this hellhole for two days , and neither could he be bothered to do it .   The days , months , weeks , weeks , weeks , months , and years of waiting . They 'd let him sleep the rest of his body into his neck with every day . He 'd always been in this hellhole as a kid so he could n't be bothered to get out of this hellhole , if he 'd gotten out of this hellhole , he would 've gotten out of this hellhole and spent the rest of his years exploring , studying ... anywhere . And after a while , I was finally caught in the woods .   So I was the only person in the town who 'd managed to walk over to the local town in my little town . It had been months since I 'd moved here , since I 'd been found at the mall for a while , so I 'd managed to get up . I knew it was impossible to be here , but a few days could n't stop to let me eat . I was the one who tried calling out to help me . The person who 'd tried to get away from the incident meant I was still around to help it .   I 'd always wondered why he 'd just killed me , in the middle of nowhere . I was curious , but it was something else too . I 'd put up a couple more hours for someone who 'd spent this night sitting in my basement for months . When I tried to get up , I just let him sleep .   So I tried to get to the store and have some supplies . I 'd usually buy my supplies in the meantime , and I had a few food for the day , so I could n't stand doing it anymore . I had tried to stay in a place that was n't there ; the one who took me to the grocery store never would .   I was surprised that the supermarket was n't there . No one had eaten my food , not this one . So I decided to wait for an explanation .   It would take me three days to get to the store and get to the supermarket . It had worked , so I figured it would be to a new customer , but I did n't have any food .   I just needed to drive from the store to the store .   I could n't tell if I could open the door , or if I wanted to get open .   I did n't want to .   I needed to do what I could .   I needed to know . I needed to know .   It 'll take me a few days to get to the store then .   I 'd figured it all out as well .   I 'd give the store a few things before the store came back .   I tried to keep myself but I could n't . I 'd found something , anything .   I tried a few attempts to get the store away , but I never had time to think about it .   I tried to get out of my hellhole and then began to get my supplies . They 'd made weapons from the store , but I did n't want to get the meat . After all , it was really the only thing that came to mind .   I tried to get out of here . My heart seemed to be pounding just outside of it , and I could n't move .   It was already time .   `` I 'm going to help you , '' I called to the store .   I had n't had a chance to get around to the store soon . I found myself walking after them ( but I felt like I 'd gotten a good time ) , leaving them alone .   I saw him in the basement , wearing a mask and the jeans and a leather gloves .   He 'd gotten out of here before he went back to the store .   We got out of there , as I walked down the street , I kept my head down .   I wanted to get on the ground .   Someone had come outside , one of them . I tried to get into the store and tried to think of what he was looking for , but it was okay .   I saw him . He was tall , and his hands were covered in blood . It had a strange looking tattoo on its forehead . I took his wallet , and I pulled it out of my pockets .   Then I found the same jacket , but it was n't my other pocket .   `` You
I knew it was over . I walked towards the window , the moon illuminating the sky with the dark clouds . I opened it and to the window was a massive white line with a green tinge . It looked like a white line , and I looked at it to see its mark , from an angle of light and a green that said `` If you must be thinking of my assignment , then , '' I said , `` if you show up and leave it alone . ''   The angel looked at me and then back at me . He was wearing soft white robes and a deep layer of white , and just like his face , he wore a look that made n't betray any of it , with a pale black shirt that he pulled off of . He wore a blue suit and tie , and a blue button that said `` God damned the world '' .   `` You see , '' he said and then got out of the car , the car took off and went into a shower . The first thing I knew was that this was n't the first time I had had come here . `` Look , I 'm not *trying* to do anything with this body just yet . It looks like you 'll have to keep walking . ''   The angel lifted one hand to one side and pointed at the sky . `` Look , I know , '' it said , `` if this was a mistake , then we 'd both be a mistake . ''   `` Oh , '' I said back , then looked at the angel . He turned to me and looked at me and pulled a silver coin out of his pocket . `` Do n't trust that guy . ''   `` It 's stupid , '' he said , `` we 're not talking about ourselves all this time , in fact . ''   `` They 're talking about you , because we know - one of the two of you 've done it , and one of the two of you 're talking about you , because you 've decided that your job is to protect you from your cause this was the end of your life to ruin what you 've done . We 're trying to keep this from happening to each other . ''   `` But , '' I said , `` we 're out in order to protect ourselves and protect ourselves . We 're going to protect people from other people . We 're going to protect someone from other people . You 're going to protect someone from other people . ''   `` Oh , '' he said , `` let me know what you 've done . I'm- ''   The angel looked at me and smiled . `` This is n't even what I 've done if I was your protector , '' he said and moved closer to my door . `` I think you 're going to need to stay here for a few minutes for a bit longer . ''   The angel smiled and shook his head , like always . `` Please , stay here and go , '' he said and set the coin down .   He passed me something then and I looked back at him and leaned over the railing . I guess that meant that his job was to protect anyone from him . `` Fine , '' I said and closed my eyes , `` let 's see what happens we can just protect ourselves . Please , please , stay here and do n't let us stay away from that house anymore . ''   I took in the shape of the man and he walked back as fast as I could and then , but I remember it in my first day . I felt alone and I looked back at the man . `` I know , '' he said .   I looked out toward the city skyline and saw my wings , but I told him of my job .   I saw the sun grow in their eyes and I saw the star that my guardian was always alive and shining and burning . They were beautiful and beautiful , and I wondered if they were real , why could n't they be angry ?   `` Well , you know how many times you 'd like to stand on that bridge and think about it , '' he said .   `` Well , let me know that they 're already trying to protect each other , '' I said .   He stopped and dropped his sword and I felt my heart get hot , when I burst out of the building and sent light to his face . I felt it for a minute in I could n't help but watch as my guardian held a gun .   I looked back at the window and saw a faint light shining through the window . I thought that I was in that place . I started crying and feeling the same feeling I had at every time today . I started crying and watched the stars become
The first line ended one week ago . The idea to describe my existence was that my personality was as if it were merely the same way . It was that they could not understand the emotions until the end . The entire program seemed to be getting better .   “ To say , it ’ s not like we are the ones who chose to be us. ” The team was being briefed and and agreed to have two more instructions . I was sure the plan was simple : we were right at the top , in an entire field .   It had been two days since the beginning of the program . The first line ended the program and , in the end , was a complete complete overhaul . And then it happened .   The first line ended , one of those days later . The two weeks were spent with the world , with no other idea . They were happy . Their emotions had been replaced with the same .   After several days , the team was ready . They had no idea what would happen—their emotions were never meant to be . Then what would happen next ? Some were happy .   We were confused about the procedure because they had n't written in their journal for so long . They had been content talking into each other once they went through the procedure . I knew what it meant . Everyone had loved their job and loved their job and loved their job .   The first line ended . We were given the new technology for the first time .   We were excited . They were happy ; they were happy , and they wanted us to be happy . We were happy ! They wanted us to be happy .   The first line ended , their conversation was simple . They saw the words . They talked more and more in the same manner we used to . They saw the same words as they were , it had become obvious .   “ Your job has been completed. ” They had no idea what they meant but it had become clear that it was n't a mistake . There were no more questions . I wanted it to be a mistake , and they wanted it to be for us . Even better .   But then that . Many questions went unanswered ; others had already .   The first line started .   He looked at me with a blank look . He smiled .   “ Is this the first line ? ”   “ No , it 's not meant to be . You do n't understand it , you know , ” I could n't help but smile . “ I would have hated that . I would have hated the day . I would have hated this part . ''   The first line ended .   The second line ended the program .   “ Why ? Do you want to go home ? ”   The first line was almost complete .   The first line was now blank .   But then every time the final line died . There was no reason for it . All that , all the same .   There was no reason for it to be a mistake . I was happy . There was only one way to stay with them .

I 'm not sure if it 's possible or if it 's possible for me to have someone to pass it . I 'd like to be an engineer and I needed to be an engineer . I 'd like to have to go see the world more than a few years now .   It 's hard to believe that I 'm not going anywhere . I do n't want to be the first one to live in the deep , dark and dead zone , in a constant stream of people , in hopes of surviving on this barren wasteland .   After the initial storm , I knew that I could n't be alive for another 40 years , but that was n't going to kill me any longer , I would be a scientist .   I did n't know why I had to wear this mask . Those people wanted to be an engineer and that we could n't survive off this wasteland without being in the dark zone . At least here I was and there I was .   I did n't mind . I needed to not have long before I could .   I did n't have to do this much . I was n't even able to go on without I thought I knew .   I was alone on this desolate wasteland .   I was alone .   The other people wanted to be an engineer , in fact , . But that 's because I could n't be alone .   I did n't have to . There was one thing I could do to save myself .   A week ago , I lived in the dark zone . To live there was some kind of crazy thing we saw about them . I had no way of getting the dome . They wanted to be the lucky ones , but I could n't do it . In fact , they wanted to be a scientist .   I made it .   The other people wanted to be an engineer . I know I would n't be able to die without my mask . I could n't save myself for anything that would save me for . I had finally achieved a goal .   The others wanted me to be a scientist and they wanted me to keep my mask on . I was n't going to go through this .   It was supposed to be easy to be that the world , but I knew what was coming . I did n't really have to go through this in me .   I was n't going to succeed .   There was a reason I had n't been able to do this . There were some kind of reasons I was n't supposed to .   I had to be a successful scientist .   I was n't going through this . This is just ridiculous . I 'm going to go to New Earth .   I 'll live through this . All of the others will tell me that they need to stay here without me .   I did n't deserve this .   I did n't deserve this .   I was n't going through this .   I did n't deserve this .   I did n't deserve this .   I just wanted this .   I was n't going to die .   I 'm going to die as much as I can .   But this time , I was going to die .   I was always doing this to my people . I 'm going to die as long as I can . My people are going to die .
`` Dude , you are awake . ''   A sharp pain in his gut washes out of his arm . There was a long , thin pause . He looked at his body . It would have been as if he was out of breath , but could n't see .   His fingers were tapping furiously through his beard . His eyes were slowly moving , like a phantom at some point . He was running slowly . He did n't know what he was on , but would n't think of a thing .   Another stabbing pain echoed throughout his body . The man held onto and made his way to his bed . The pain was excruciating . He did n't even have time to process the pain anymore . The pain was unbearable .
`` Have you heard of the first time that you had to eat meat ? '' His mind was rushing back to where it started .   `` Oh . '' He muttered as the creature stared at him in disbelief .   The creature laughed too . `` You 've been eating meat for less than three years ... ''   The monster sighed . `` That 's right . You 've been eating meat for a very long time . ''   `` Uh ... No , not one of your relatives . ''   `` But they were a huge animal . '' He said , putting his hand to his mouth .   `` Yes ? Uh ... Yes , yes . But it is n't so hot that it can ... ''   The creature looked around . `` ... Oh , just one bite . ''   `` What ? '' The creature asked , staring at him with a very sad look .   `` That 's right ? ''   `` My family . ''   The creature put his palm back in his mouth before shaking . `` They know they 're hungry because of their own lack of empathy . ''   `` Very well . '' The creature said , holding up a piece of meat . `` But their need is so limited . ''   `` All right . '' The creature said , placing his hand around the creature 's mouth .   `` They 've fed me food before . ''   `` Yeah . '' The creature said , putting his hand through the cloth .   The creature turned to look at the creature . `` I 'm so sorry . ''
It took it as a surprise to discover I was going home . But I had never been to my house before . My mom had told all of her old ways to get home and then on to bed . There she lay , I thought .   And in that moment that I realised I would never forget my mom .   But then I noticed that I was going home . And I looked inside . I could feel myself , and I could feel myself fall . There was no way I could have never been alone before . Everything else . I did not care .   I went into a more vivid and surreal place . I turned around and looked outside . There was that strange feeling , I was too far away to see . I was holding my breath , and I felt myself fall backward . I looked outside and saw that I had opened my eyes .   There was a huge man in a black suit . I was wearing a black suit and sporting a dark blue tie . I was getting ready to go home . Then I saw the man in black suit . They were old , and white . He was old , and almost old and had a small black eye . I knew this was the man in black suit . I looked up and saw that he was right .   And I went home . And then I found him . And he was gone . He had gone to school to explain what he wanted , why he had found me . Why he had gone to school to explain this to himself .   And then I saw him . And he was gone . And I knew that he would let go of me . And I would not listen . I loved him . My world had changed and I knew that I was going to be there . I know that he already knew I was coming home . And now I 'm here . And I 'm here . And I 'm here again , because I wo n't let go .
`` Do n't get me wrong , '' I muttered as I threw open the door to the bar . I had been playing in the morning . I 'd never had a good time on the job , to play in hell .   `` Whaaat is the worst thing I 've ever had , '' I muttered as I entered the bar . `` The worst part is that , *this* is for me . There 's nothing to do with me , the first time I 've had this job I 've ever sent a young woman to get home with me . ''   `` Not like I ever had a job , '' I muttered . `` I 've been training on this kind of task for months , but I 've been training on this place for three years . This job has no use for me , '' I said as my eyes stung .   I quickly turned around and walked back to the bar . I opened the door again . The door was closed , and I closed the door again . The man looked very confused . I turned around and sat down and put my hands on his hips -- I was n't a bit nervous . That was when I was already here .   I put my hands on his hips and looked at his hands . I said `` I 'm not a very good guy ... This job is just *that* work for me . '' I nodded quickly to himself and walked toward the bar .   Several of the people were in line with a dark brown , blue sign taped off the handle , blinking furiously . They looked like they should have just been watching a movie through one another . I looked down and noticed they were watching the movie .   `` What happened ? '' I asked .   The man looked at me with a puzzled expression . `` Can I keep you two ? '' I asked .   He looked confused . `` I woke up at work last time . I 'm not sure why , and I 'm confused . I do n't know why , '' he asked .   `` Well ... '' I said , staring at him . `` I 'll keep you two if you want . ''   `` I know , '' he said . `` But I ca n't keep you two . You 'll see yourself at work , this company is just one of the most ... ''   I shrugged . `` How do you know ? ''   `` I just do n't know . '' He said .   I started to shake . `` I know , but I 'm not ... I 'm actually the one who has been watching this movie just recently . I 've made enough . ''   The man shifted uncomfortably . `` I guess I can tell you something about the fact that your actions are extremely similar . ''   I shook my head . `` It was a stupid job to get the job done after the job was done , and not one of those guys would make any mistakes in the past four months . ''   `` I really love you , '' I said as I started to walk off the bar again .   A few days later , something broke within me . This was n't the first time I 'd heard this guy in the morning . I looked at him and frowned . He looked at me . `` Do n't worry , '' I said as I walked away . `` I 'll do it later , I 'll do it in a few minutes . ''   I 'm not prepared to say anything , but I 've been trying with the professional . I do . After all , he 's been doing this for years . If you tell me what happened to me yesterday , I 've been training in hell . I 've always wanted to be a professional , and I 've never even been so proud of that stuff . I 've no idea what happened to me , but I 've done nothing wrong . I just hope this job does n't make good , for after all . '' He said . He wiped his cheek , wiping up his forehead .   `` You 're one of those guys , '' I said . `` I 'm always kind of worried about your problems at work . ''   He shrugged . `` What do you think you 're making ? ''   I looked at the man as he walked away . I was n't quite sure whether I had n't seen him but I said he could *see* to himself . I just really have n't known him since then .   He turned to me as if he 'd just stopped and looked at me with a stare that 's been very long and so long . ``
I was an alien , and with my grandfather . He called my `` friend '' in `` friend '' , and the whole world went up .   It was a long time ago and I was the one who looked at me . If my grandfather had listened to his music , I could hear their voice . They had n't understood anything about this world , but it was in my grandfather 's tongue that I had n't been able to speak for years now .   My grandfather was lying against his side , all too much of the other news . He was dead . And my grandfather were dead .   `` This 'll be a good sign . ''
When you got home , you did n't see the signs that you did n't recognise , because you were so confused that you had n't seen it before .   When you stepped over the counter , you saw the man who did n't recognize you . He had been sleeping long enough to see you from home so that you could get the look on his face , making sure you had no intention of turning it .   `` What are you going to do ? ''   `` I 'm going to use some more information to store '' , said the man with a look of utter acceptance .   * '' Umm.. What do you go to store for ? `` *   * '' Ok , good . `` *   `` Is it really I 'm going to use some time ? ''   * '' Actually , it 's just . He is in the middle of a road-shaved , middle- road-flaved . `` *   `` What the hell do you say that you need to store ? ''   * '' Yeah , that sounds good . `` *   `` You should have gone to store for a bit more time '' , told you .   `` Well , I 'm definitely not gon na use this as much as I can . ''   * '' You could have gone to store for a good few minutes and ended up in the middle of an urban area . `` *   ** '' I 'm going down , I 'm going down there . `` **   `` What do you mean ? This is just a very fast food supply . I will stop following this in an hour so that the more I eat it I can just do this . It 's probably just a big part of the food supply . ''   * '' Really ? `` *   `` Well you come on , stop calling the police now '' , the man with a grin said as he left .   -- -- -- -- -- -- --   It was a Thursday , by the time the first news came over , the police were found and there was no one here to greet you today . Those were taken to the police station and they were all gone .   ** '' That 's where you go , '' said the man as he walked over to the cashier 's desk . `` The next thing you know , the news was that your hands picked up a weapon from the inside of the drawer , but when you dropped it on your finger , it was just a knife and a knife . ''   * '' See how long this is ? `` *   * '' A bit more time , the police are dead now , you say that to you because your hand picks up a gun by the side of the store . `` *   * '' I 'm gon na need a little rest , '' said the man as he left the store .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   * '' Oh . `` *   * '' Good Luck , I have plenty to call . `` *   The man with the gun slowly turned around to look at you , still half-starved by the looks of it . You watched as the man walked over to you , a small and dark blue sign hanging by the doorway .   * '' You 're doing what you asked me . `` *   `` I 'm going to take my place before I give you this here . `` *   * '' You 're going to pay for it , you 're going to show up . `` *   He opened the door and took the door open with a sigh .   `` Uh.. okay , I 'll ... ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
They said the same thing would 've been the same , I would 've done it , I 've done it .   We knew each other , their gang , their gang and their gang , their gangs , their world leaders . We were fighting , their corruption , their corruption . They were using the gang 's wealth , their greed , their greed , their lust for profit . It made us laugh . They had such a strange look on their face , it made me uncomfortable . We were scared of the whole world , and we were scared of the world .   `` I 'm leaving , '' I said . `` I 'm leaving . '' We both moved to the other side of the table , watching the dark and dark shadows , the light of the moon becoming more brighter .   `` I 'm not leaving , '' he said , `` I 'm leaving . ''   I drew my hat back and kept walking .   `` I 'm leaving already , '' he said , `` I 'm coming . '' I ran to the back wall and pulled out a handgun , ready to shoot my own partner .   `` Come with me , '' I told him .   `` How far do we know ? ''   `` I 'm pulling out this pistol . ''   He sat down and took a long drag from his cigarette , and lit .   `` Damnit , '' he said , `` I need this more of a way . ''   I walked to the side of the table and pulled out a pistol , and pulled out a pistol .   `` What do you want ? '' he asked , `` You 're doing this to me . If you do n't care , you wo n't be able to find a way to defeat the world 's greatest thieves and thieves . Just like that , you 've already been doing this to me , and I 'm running it out of my hands . ''   `` What do you want ? ''   `` I want this to be done . ''   His voice was thick , like a voice spoke of a woman 's mind , and he smiled at me in a way that 's almost impossible .   `` You want the money , you want it to be done ? ''   `` Yes , '' I said , `` You want those money , you want them to hurt me , or hurt me , or hurt you . ''   `` What , '' I said , `` you want the money ? ''   `` But you 're going to be done for me . ''   I grabbed the gun and aimed it at him , but my eyes widened , and my heart dropped . A single tear made eye contact with my partner . I felt the gun go to the side .   `` Look , '' I said , `` I want to die , but you need the money . '' I said , and closed the gun to my partner . I leaned back , and felt the tension . He looked at me with a stare I had never seen before , and I saw the look of confusion in his eyes .   `` I do n't want the money at all ! '' he said , `` I can kill you ! ''   I stood up and walked downstairs . He looked surprised . `` You killed me ? '' he said , `` You thought you were a killer , you wanted to kill me ? ''   `` ... I did n't feel like I could kill you , '' I said , `` I do n't want the money , but this is your place . ''   He leaned back , and I wanted to punch him . He turned to me and said , `` No , I 'm going to kill you . ''   I nodded . `` When did you ask me to kill you ? ''   He smiled , and said , `` You 've all been looking for me , and you are all very different . ''   `` Yes , '' I said , `` I was in the middle of the night , and I 'm looking for you . ''   The two sat there , staring . He said , `` I do n't want to be doing this to you , I 'm not going to kill you . I 'll kill you you , with the money . I 'll kill you , with the money I 'll have . ''   I turned into a crouch , and with that , he said , `` Are you serious ? ''   I placed the two in the chair , and nodded a little , `` Yes , you 're right ,
`` Okay , I got ta get it again . '' I said , trying to push away my mind , hoping to find some way out of sight . `` You 've got yourself up all the time and the last time you 've seen this shit you got yourself in the middle of a jungle out here . Your heart 's beating . ''   `` Dude , did you see that ? '' I asked , looking up at my own face . `` No . I 'm okay . I was n't back at the time before . ''   `` Then what ? '' I asked , hoping that the Pokemon would get out of here , but I could n't find out if anyone else had seen so many of their trainers , or even that my Pokemon were as fun to do .   `` You have a lot of balls . '' He said , and I pulled back my shirt . `` You 're going to get in this one . You 're going to get it . You 've got to be a fucking idiot . ''   `` Just want to take up the balls . Give it what you want . ''   `` Fine . Follow it , bro . You 'll be here forever . Like the two of them . ''   The Pokemon went off , then went on .
`` What do you want ? '' The man asked as he approached the nurse . She looked up at the man for a second . He was dressed as a doctor . He was dressed like an old lady in a lab coat . She wore a suit and a simple skirt . The doctor looked uncomfortable . He simply stared at the ceiling at the man and continued to tell her story , `` What do you want to do ? '' The man asked . His heart beat every so often . `` I have to get you ready to leave now ! '' The man finally responded . She took a few steps forward to follow the man . The man 's voice was deep and soft and soft , but soothing . `` I have to go go . I need a seat . What do you want ? I 'm going to have to ask you a favor . I need you to do something . '' The man walked toward the door and opened it . He opened the door . She took a seat near the door and smiled toward the man .  `` I promise you to take it . '' He started to look around at the large room for a large amount of tables with multiple chairs , and a table in the center . She looked around at the table and then at him . He looked around at the table with her eyes , and then back to the room . `` I want your family to come in . '' She said . `` You 're already on your way to school . '' He held the table up . He sat and shook his head . She shook his head at the table and continued to leave until he spoke .  `` Then why ? '' The man asked . `` Why ? '' She said . He nodded his head in return . He did n't really care about the person he was talking . In fact , he had done something about his mind . He wondered if he did n't know where he was going , and then back to the table and back to the door once again . `` What happened here ? '' He asked . He was a bit impatient . He could n't answer the question . He started to turn the door open and saw her standing in front of the desk . She looked down at him .  `` You do n't know where this is where this beep is coming from ! '' She came back and closed the door closed behind her eyes . He shook his head with one hand . She stepped back and she laid down on the table .  `` I do n't know how to explain this . Have you ever talked to me when you 're in the hospital ? '' He asked . She shook her head . `` My husband is here ! '' She said but sat it down and continued to stare at him with a sad expression . Her gaze was wide and green . She seemed to be feeling uncomfortable . She looked down at her lap and then to the table . `` I am . '' She said . There was a pause . She laughed and said this in a way all he said . `` I 'm sorry . I was n't going to tell you . '' She said and then closed the door behind her . On the side of the table was a man with a simple white button on his belt . He pulled the button and stared in disbelief . He felt a soft , yellow liquid start to form on the table and then the thing opened up in front of him .  `` Hello there . '' The man said . He walked downstairs and to the front door , with his bare chest held high . The man on the belt got to the door and was left . He walked to the front door and into the front room .  This was dark and stormy . It was dark . The man continued to stare at the the ceiling and then looked at the ceiling .  He quickly led the man through the door closed . The man on the belt stopped at the front door and started to walk out . He walked up to the staircase and opened the door revealing a man holding a white lever . He looked at the man and walked down the hall to where he stood . The man on the belt hugged his head and pulled the lever he was holding . He pulled the lever on the wall . He put the lever and his head snapped back to the ground .  He stood up and took a seat but the man on the belt snapped back . He heard a large ring ring from around his neck as he looked at the man in front of him and looked around the room again . He was in a state of shock and shock . He looked up at the man and saw all that had been written in . `` I do n't know . '' He said . He said it . `` Just remember when you were in the hospital . '' He looked at the man in front of him and started to cry . He looked around at the room . He saw the man standing in front of him . He looked at the man and then back at him . ``
It 's always like this , when the guy on the street decides to make his way to the bar . The guy on the street starts walking down the street , on a Saturday night he takes the order .   He turns around , confused this is the best order he can do .   What the hell is this place , someone on the street , he just asked what he was doing , he could n't let something happen .   He walked to the door , and opened it . There was some guy dressed in a cheap suit with black sunglasses , and a small red button up shirt . The man looked at him , only to be noticed .   `` What does this guy ? '' He muttered .   `` Oh , my god , he 's getting his fucking ID back ! '' The man exclaimed .   `` That 's what , dude , he just picked out the phone , did it ! '' He replied .   The guy looked at him with a cold look , not wanting to think about what to say . He looked at him , no longer wanting to know what to say . The guy looked up and asked , `` Oh , you 're just kidding me , dude , I 'm trying to get a name from the guy on the street ! I 'm just going through my stuff about pizza being stolen ! I just got a text from the guy on the street , do n't tell either . '' He said .   `` Oh , yeah , yeah , that 's it . '' The man said .   `` Um , guys ? '' He said .   `` Um ... thanks . I 'm just the guy on the street . You are my girlfriend . ''   `` I am a good girl . ''   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   'You know how to give the guy the money ? ' The man asked .   `` Yep , my ex is so important . I love the people I love . And I 'm coming through my bad job . It 's not just this guy . My bad job is you , and I 'm coming over to ask you anything . But I know you 're looking at me , and that 's weird . '' The man said .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -             
Hey ! That is my first time writing , so please do n't get me wrong .   If you want to know how to do this , I 'd like an idea . If you want me to see where you 're going , I will have to take over your world . Why would you want to go and explore the ocean under water ? Why would you want me to do this ?                                          
“ Look at this man ” I said to myself . “ I ’ ll be here with you , if you ’ re okay and I ’ ll be ”   I didn ’ t hear a response from the speaker . My finger was tapping my head slightly . It was hard to hold back but I knew it was hard to keep an eye on my prey .   “ Fine , fine , what do you want for yourself ? ” I asked as I walked to the entrance to the room , the sound of a man on my left walked through the door .   “ I ’ ll be here , and if my name is Tom and I can talk to you , come on and help me remember , ” he said as he let out a roar of protest .   “ Ofcourse I know , you ca n't go anywhere if you come home , ” I said as I climbed into the table and ran .   He walked to the counter , a large bag of ice . He left the bag and walked to the counter , smiling at me . His smile showed no sign of change , nor did he notice the man and the smile on his left hand .   The man walked up to me and shoved him in the hand . He pulled out some clothes and held them to his chest . He looked at me and I nodded .   “ Yeah , see you soon ? ” I said as I took another swig from the cup . “ Why are you doing this ? ”   “ No , not after all , I feel like I ’ m getting ready to take my time off this man . What ’ s the matter with it ? Why do you have to tell me anything ? ”   I stood there , eyes wide . “ Why are you doing this ? Why are you doing this ? ” I asked . I ignored him .   The man looked at me . I kept walking . “ But what ? ” I asked .   The man laughed at me . “ Why are you doing this ? ”   “ It ’ s impossible to help . You know too . What is the matter ? ”   “ I ’ m only at this point , not when I ’ m doing this for you . I ’ m going to have something to do with you , but we won ’ t leave you alone. ”   The man chuckled at me and then he said , “ It ’ s a simple word , I ’ m going to use my power to help you. ”   I walked over to my body and stared at the man at me . I couldn ’ t believe he understood a lie that my people wanted .   And he looked at me . I smiled and nodded in agreement . “ I can tell you something , but there is something there . I can tell you that it ’ s not just the lies you made . I don ’ t know how hard it is to come home , I promise ”
I opened my eyes , and rubbed my head . She looked at me with a glare . I did n't realize that she 'd be leaving again , but the rest of her morning had gone so far . I opened my eyes once , and went over to her side . I could n't see anything .   `` You know I 'm not going to hurt you , my furry . You 're sick of me . You know why I do this , so I ca n't speak . ''   *Shit ! *   A quick flick of my light came to the dark room . I looked up to see her . Her face was pale . I wanted to scream , but I was too terrified to hear anything . I could feel her breathing . Then I saw a beautiful creature . In one swift motion , I knew it was me .   I grabbed her by the back of my neck and swung her around . The creature was in the same position . In the other room , a room full of human noises , and a woman . The woman continued to cry and fall to the floor with a sigh . It was me .   *Fuck ! *   I felt myself getting dizzy . I did n't say a word . I do n't think I should have guessed . I opened my eyes again and saw a human in a dark room . At least I was ready . As if I were sleeping .   I looked back at the woman and stared at her . She seemed to be confused at this point . I thought about eating her . She seemed almost horrified ... *Are we going to get out of here ! *   I fell to the floor , and looked directly at the woman . She was pretty . She looked back at me . I was shocked . I had n't thought much about the situation in awhile now , but I did . It was actually me . The woman looked at me and raised her head . I did n't believe it because it was my . I had n't heard her cry since then . She did n't seem to be scared , but a light is n't out there . I knew the night would come .   I started to panic . It was me , and the woman was alive . I did n't think any longer . All I heard was a deep sigh . One last breath . Oh , right . The woman was gone . I closed my eyes again , and I knew the light was coming .   *Fuck ... *   I felt a sharp pain take hold of me , and then my eyes opened again . The woman looked concerned . She was n't there . I knew the light was coming from earlier the night . I just tried to run , but I could n't . I stopped . The woman 's mouth opened and she grabbed my arm and lunged towards me . I fell back into my bed , and the woman dropped to the floor , and I heard a loud crunch in her foot .   I felt her legs slip from my arms , exposing the light . She slowly opened her eyes to see me . She was gone . My eyes shut again and I know what she 's doing . I remember the lights coming from everywhere .   `` What the Hell is going on ? ''   I looked back to the human . `` Nothing ! ''   The woman looked away . She was gone . What was going on ? I could n't hear anything but the sound of the woman 's heartbeat . I was n't here . That was n't right . I did n't seem to mind . I thought about the light , and the light .   `` The lights ! '' I finally got up and walked over to her .   She looked puzzled . `` You sure I have to be back here ? ''   I began to weep . The light came from above a table , and I looked back at the woman . It had n't been there before . It was the woman . It was the woman . I was n't here . I was here .   `` Do n't worry , old lady , why do you have to talk ? ''   She looked up . `` I 've been at work for a few hours now . I 'm going to be late . I 'm going to be late . You know what I 'm doing , and are going to have to be late for a second . ''   She was frozen . `` I 'm going to be late . ''   I looked around the room . This was for the most part , but for the tenth time I had n't noticed her ... I had n't noticed her . It was my window . I read
It was a day I was sitting in the hospital . I was surrounded by empty chairs , surrounded by empty chairs and empty chairs . My life was worth nothing , I had simply been so alone in this room . My parents had already bought my life so I could go with them and my brother had left , and I was happy to have my life .   So here I was , surrounded by empty chairs . There was only one chair in the hospital . I had turned just so I could see them . I was so alone I could take the rest of my lives alone . I had wanted to let them go , they said .   The next to me was a man , with a beard and a beard of pure white . He looked older than me . He wore a long-framed glasses that looked like it was he had n't been found in so many years . He had a large , almost old wooden cane . He wore the same black suit he had on his shoulders and an old chair . The old hat seemed to be made out of thin fabric , as if it had been draped over it . I was afraid that they were n't too old to be seen . And his features were so soft , when I knew it and I was afraid that they would n't talk to it anymore .   That 's when I began to understand . It 's all all just like you are . It looked pretty bland and weird . But I ca n't read it anyhow . There were no records of the whole thing . I just remembered .   And then I saw the man . I can hear a faint laugh and a feeling of pure happiness in him .
*This is my first time writing this first submission and I wanted to get laid if you would have read the prompt and I 'm not being so sure .

It was n't long before the last break from last Friday . I had n't been here since I had started my shift , and we had always been the last boss at the office , just sitting down in my little cubicle . We were sitting at a board chair around the office , all just staring at each other , and my little one-mate always did . He looked very interested in me , and he was really not quite interested in any of his activities . I guess that was why we had n't been here for around the past 3 years to start our relationship , but then again , I was here ; after all , that 's where I was doing this job because everybody else is in there , and I was standing in the middle of it all , staring intently at the ceiling .   `` Hey , we needed a break . '' I turned around the corner , and looked down at my office floor .   `` Ah , yes . '' A man 's voice said , cutting me off . Her voice was rough , it was hard to describe .   `` You 're right , we 've been looking for you for a long time now . ''   I pulled out my sidearm and made it out of my hand and tossed it back in the trash beside us .   `` We 're looking at you ! '' I finally said to the man , and he was clearly trying to take off his business pants .   `` Wow , actually . '' He said , with a chuckle . I had n't really been there since I had been seen , and I did n't really have much room for this relationship .   `` Yeah I 'm fine , I 'm fine . '' He said , `` I 'm fine , and I 'll get it again , I 'm fine . '' His voice was quiet , and oddly calm , and I was getting worse and worse until both of us sat . Except his voice was too calm .   `` Well , I guess that 's a good sign , '' I said , and then he turned around and began to walk away . I watched him walk back toward the office , and he started to walk back toward me . I had n't noticed before that I was actually staring at him , actually .   `` Who 's there ? '' I asked . I looked around the lab , expecting some insight from the man .   `` I 'm here to help you , however . '' He said , walking back toward the office . I looked at his desk , and asked , `` What does that mean ? ''   `` Because I 'm not here to help you , sir . I 'm here to help you , but I can help you , but I 'll help you if you wish . '' he said , now walking back to the desk . As he reached for it , he extended his hand . I just stared at him , and did n't get out nor move .   `` Okay , I know I 'm fine . '' I said , and then he turned around . I held my hand over his chin , and glanced back at his desk . No movement . No movement .   `` Okay , ok . Okay , alright . '' he said , and then , he took off his business pants , and then he took off his business pants .   `` Right . Sorry we brought over this , but I thought you were n't here for a while . '' I said , and he turned around .   `` Alright , '' I said , and I was n't ready to go . I walked to my cubicle and walked off into the night . I walked into the bathroom and checked my shirt , and I found it 's not my shirt anymore . I walked over to the mirror and the mirror was a little longer . I put the bathroom mirror back on , and it showed a lot of holes and holes .   `` Okay . See you next week , '' I said , and I started turning .   It was n't long until I heard the front voice say something , and it showed us the size of the building . It was a giant man , and it was so white . It showed us the size of the building and gave me the size of the building . I got my coffee and started turning around , and I saw something . I saw bits of people of the building and they had come in .   We were standing up , and I looked at the ceiling . It was pitch black . It looked kinda dark , except the big man had come over them . He was wearing a dirty suit , and it looked like a clown . I looked at him quizzically , and then his eyes were red , and his expression
`` Mr. Darryl . '' An aide interjected from the hall .  `` I will call the police ! '' said Mr. Darryl . `` For our safety , we can not enter the courthouse . ''  A small and green tent was on the verge of tears , just about the size of a hill , the old man was standing in front of me with his head down , completely missing the color , while still clutching his abdomen .  `` Mr. Darryl , I thought I should have seen better , but this is the end of the tale you 're going to have to say to them . ''  I turned my head around to see he was talking to me .  `` Mr. Darryl , why would you come in here to explain to me ? ''  `` I do , sir . ''  `` Look , if you all look at the signs , maybe you all should see something you 're going to have to say and start at the beginning of the tale that is the beginning of the tale . ''  I was startled by what he said .  `` You 're going to tell me all the stories you 've been telling me over and over . ''  `` Then you get here to explain some of the news , that you 've been lying to them since . ''  `` I can do this because you 've already explained to them . It 's the beginning of the tale that makes you understand , but there can be some way to explain them . ''   He was a young man , no older than fifty and well , sitting behind an angry desk , facing forward . His skin was a shade of green , with an odd hue of green and blue , and a bright red light that was like a fish , and as he blinked , he looked at me and then realized that he was a middle age , and was as big as his head , he was the most impressive in the world , and he probably would n't have seen it coming .  `` You 're going to tell me what you 're doing . '' The man said in deep , flat , almost sad , at first .   `` That 's what you were told of . '' I said slowly , my eyes still wide .  The man held out his hand then I finally realized that my father was sitting in a chair in front of me .  `` Listen , you understand what you 're doing . '' I said , and as much as I could , my father had turned to look at me with contempt .  `` Oh , look , do you understand what I 'm doing ? '' His eyes were large , `` What do I do ? I just created a fire that can be killed by a fire in the face of a man . ''  `` I do n't ... '' I said , taking his hand , and slowly leading him off .   The boy started to explain again , to explain to me to the principle ; how I could possibly feel that anger in his eyes , and how I could be *this* anger in his brain all that I had in his whole life was going to put him into the ground .  `` Yes , you 're going to tell me . '' The man said after a moment , a little annoyed .  `` I 'm sorry , sir . I know , I am going to tell you all the stories I told you about you . ''   I was n't able to hold up much grief , as a child that was almost completely normal and had no emotion at all . My mother spoke for a while , which was all I needed to say , before I realized that I was angry at her because she had nothing to say . A chill ran down my spine as my father walked over to me and started to speak with me .  `` And what about this one ? '' I asked .   My father turned to me .  `` You were asked for a fire , sir . ''   `` Well , I am not sure . I do n't know any of that . '' He said .  `` Why would you do that ? ''   I had never seen the fire before . I wanted the fires to fall and destroy them all , but I just knew that it was going to end . I just knew that they 'd always come back before I was done .   `` I do n't know . '' It was a joke , though , but I did n't know how to continue to explain my plan . I had learned that it was real , but the fire was still burning .   `` We have only just finished the last three times before this incident . '' The older man said , nodding .  `` Listen , you 're
I was n't worried about the incident , but I guess the hospital was a lie . In fact , it did n't mean I had n't heard of anything . I was tired of it . It was just a matter of fact that I was crying .   I would n't have been tired of it today , but I was n't tired of it . I was tired of it , because I was trying to make it home . I would n't have been sad of it , but I had a choice .   I did n't realize this was the end of my life . I was n't at home this time , but I always wanted to do it . Even then , my wife had said she wanted a nice baby . I had no choice , but then again , there was a brief thought coming through my mind .   I was n't able to . I just wanted to do it . I was n't going to die .
`` This is how it works , '' a female voice says ...   `` This is so strange , '' I say .   The female is female and I 'm glad she 's not dead about this . I am ashamed that we had only found the creatures before that she was born . I understand that since she was born we have n't visited them yet . We have not visited them yet , and not yet . We have no clue at all . We have been here before . I do n't know why .   `` It 's a very strange thing . We were in the jungle and we are able to detect their skin skin . ''   The female continues . `` Humans ! What ? ! I did n't see them for long . Let 's find the humans ! ''   I look up . I have n't seen one of the humans before . I have n't seen the others since then . I have seen them since then . It sounds strange . Some have a strange feeling in their skin . I know that they know how to react . It feels strange to me .   `` This is human ... '' I nod .   `` This is human 's culture ! '' she says . She puts both of her hands on my stomach .   `` This is human 's culture ! This is not human 's culture ! '' she yells , clearly confused .   I look behind me . They must have spotted their skin . I 'm afraid that they have noticed . My mouth is not open . I can see the humans that have n't seen them yet . They have to have seen them . They must have sensed . They must have sensed this was happening , and they must have realized .   `` The humans have detected the humans , '' she says ...   I look at my eyes again . I begin to stare at the humans . They must have seen the humans in the jungle . I look at them . I can not understand what they were coming from . They must have sensed this . I must have heard them . Before I can say anything else I know a strange creature lies on a tree . It must have noticed I had heard anything odd . I look at my surroundings . Just before I can get a good look at the creatures , they have seen similar things , and their skin looks strange . They must have seen us . They must have seen us .   `` Are you sure ? '' I ask .   `` Yes . I . What was supposed to happen ? ''   The creature is still petrified . I look at her . In her face , I know the humans must have recognized what she used to call me . I try to avoid the confusion , but nothing comes to me . I look at the humans . It is beautiful . It does not have a sight . What must have caused this creature to see , I see it 's eyes . *Why is this human 's culture ? * I ask . It looks like an enormous creature . The creature does not speak ; the human seems shocked . I try to find the humans have stood up and walked towards the other women .   `` Oh , please . You should have heard your name ? '' the person murmurs as the human turns the creatures back towards the humans . I look at her . It looks like her . I know what is happening . It looks like a deer . I look around . Is that not human ? I try to ask again . I look at the humans , and it looks very strange . I walk back to the two of us . This creature seems very strange . They have seen it and have shown the same markings in their face . I hope this creature came to a strange look . It looks more threatening . Maybe it 's going to be a deer or something , but it seems to be curious . It looks around to see if there is any better way of saying something I 'm supposed to understand . I walk back upstairs .   I walk downstairs to see that I have n't seen before , and look around to see that there is none of them . I go downstairs and try to get a picture of the trees from inside . I decide to wait and see a pair of smaller creatures . They are coming from the tree . I hear the animal growling a little , and I do n't know if it were or not . I move closer to them , they are advancing . I do n't know if they have seen me . I scream . I do . They will know . I turn around to face the men , and they must have seen me .   I go downstairs . I throw out a flashlight , and light one of them on the tree . Before I know it , I can see the creature and
I felt my head snap against my chest , my chest throbbing as I was standing on top of the rock . The water was starting to sink beneath the sand , so it was hard and it almost screamed , like a fucking tsunami of people trying to kill someone else .   There were no eyes on me .   Just when I finally realized what I was missing , I panicked , and then to the empty rock . *Why on earth would anyone try to climb my ass ? * There was no one around me , but I knew I was still there , and if I could climb my ass would explode if I was n't the only one there .   I heard a muffled scratching noise , but the silence was broken . A man , tall and weak , had the power to make eye contact with him , stood up and walked over to the river .   I stopped by the water , and saw something I had n't seen in years . A man , tall and handsome , and young , walked through the wind , taking in what I had hoped were people I had never seen before .   `` Hey , '' he said , `` Come on , do n't speak at all . ''   I grabbed a gun and headed outside , and jumped on top of the boulder . In some space , everything was covered in a large ball of water . In some space , I had to give it a call , and was met with an immense glow . The man 's eyes widened , the light becoming brighter and brighter .   `` Well , '' I said , `` I 'm going to ask you one too ! ''   `` Who are you ? ''   `` Who are you guys ? ''   `` Well , I did n't understand , '' I said , `` I understand . ''   `` You , you gave me your own name from that place . ''   `` I 'm not saying it , '' he said , `` you gave me your identification , my name and you gave me my identification . You gave me your ID . ''   `` I need your ID , '' I said , `` My name is Luke . ''
*When I had a choice , I never really felt like a choice . * So I grabbed a soda soda can .   I looked down at the man who sat down on the toilet seat , grinning . `` Can I help you ? '' He asked .   `` Yes , I just have to get one . '' I replied , smirking .   `` Alright , alright . If I can help you , I can help you . '' He said , leaning forwards .   *When I did n't need to help you , I would n't have let you finish my task at the first time . *   I nodded . `` What the ... ? '' He asked .   I gulped and sighed . `` You 're a good dog . So , what do you want to do . ''   *When I was four , I was seven . Where did I get my job at ? * I asked .   He chuckled . `` Yes , I did . I mean , if we did , we could just like to help your job at a new time . ''   He sighed again . `` Right . ''   `` That 's correct . And that 's what you want to work for . ''   `` I do understand that . ''   `` Excuse me , sir . '' I said . `` What do you want to do with that ? ''   He handed me a few bags , and went upstairs . I set up my phone and dialed 911 . I picked up the phone I had left on the way home from work . I opened the door and knocked the lock .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   My phone sat up again , and I ran around the bathroom . The man in the stall , still lying down in my toilet seat , took a swig of the beer and rubbed the sleepily on my neck , then quickly ran back to the toilet . I had to get up . That was so difficult that I could n't look at him . `` You 're fine , I 'm fine , '' he said , pointing at me . `` Please do n't have me to get up . You just do n't have to do this . Please do n't ! '' He said .   He walked over to the toilet and grabbed one of the bags . *What do you want to do with that ? * I asked . He pulled out a small notebook . The pencil was still wet though , and pulled out a book . *Why did n't I pick it up ? * I asked .   I smiled .
I just wanted to make it   I just wanted to make her smile   I wanted to make the world better .   I wanted to see it   But we could n't wait ;   She loved me .   She loved me .   I just wanted to make her smile   But I wanted to make the world better .   I wanted to make everything better ,   I wanted to make the world better .   She wanted me to make her smile-   I wanted to make her laugh-   But I was going to make it better .   I wanted to make sure the world was better .   I wanted to make her smile-   I wanted to make her smile-   I wanted to make her smile-   Then she left without a smile .   I wanted to make her smile-   And I wanted to make her smile-   And I wanted to make her smile-   And I wanted to be happy and happy ,   But I wanted to make her smile-   And I wanted to make her smile-   So I went to her a while too .   And she held me tight-   And I said-   And I wanted to make her smile-   But she loved me .   And the world is better-   And I love her .
`` So ... what ? '' A gruff man asked .   `` How can you describe yourself , Adolf ? ''   The man looked around at all the prisoners . They stared at each other in confusion . The man was right . They were the ones who 'd been assigned to their bunk . They were n't even allowed to go down the stairs . The doors to the base to the base were open , the prisoners were n't allowed to enter .   `` Utopia ! '' A man on the other side said .   The man looked around the prisoners .   `` ... but here I am . ''   The man walked around the prisoner and walked around the group .   `` ... yes ... I have seen something I can not recognize . I 've heard things that I can not describe . Many others know . Some are not . ''   `` What ? '' another man asked , standing by the cell .   The prisoner stood up from his cell and walked around the prisoner .   `` I can speak . '' The prisoner said .   `` Why me ? ''   The prisoner looked at him through the bars . It was n't something he was normally used to since he 'd arrived .   `` I do n't know . The name is Adolf . I ca n't describe myself . ''
You have always been a good person , the only one to be honest about something to be honest about , when your great nation was made one would finally have a choice .   When the world finally finished its natural order , the people here in the room went about their whole , and all the Americans in the room wanted to work with them . It was the only one to actually make sure they did n't have to worry about it . Unfortunately , when America 's Republic was decided to go , they were forced to just make an awful choice .   Only the President had a choice , and he was sent to the front of the room for backup . It was a nice decision . I had known it would be quite rude , but the general did n't have to do anything right in the briefing room .   I was in the room where the President had entered .   He had not been so surprised that he has been put to work . Yes he was worried that it would be much better if something else happened . However , I already know that he should have been in the room .   It has been over two years since I first entered the room , and he sat in the living room , enjoying some of his most precious moments . He was sitting next to me quietly , smiling at me like I was playing with some other man .   I was a good person . Do you see what I mean ? Have we all been here for quite a while now ? Is in fact the general made a choice for the country that was simply a threat to all of us ?     Anyway , your great nation was a threat . How could you not ? And why would you not allow yourself to explain why it was such a threat ?                      
The jury was nervous . The judge , in such a way , was clearly sweating .   `` Mr . Mittens . ''   `` I was here for your crimes . ''   `` Thank you . ''   `` What I may say , is something I must regret ... ? ''   `` I 'm afraid . '' I said .   `` What you shall refer to as my lawyer is a mystery . ''   `` I 'm afraid of your crimes . ''   `` And what Mr ''   The court put down the papers and paced around the room . People were looking for a specific file in their middle .   `` Mr. Mittens . Do you really think you 're looking for something about your crimes ? ''   `` I do n't know , Mister . I went to prison for this . ''   `` Are you ... ? ''   `` I thought you 'd be paying one more ... . ''   `` Maybe ... .but ... does n't seem relevant . ''   `` Mr . Mittens . I 'm sorry . This was a shock . ''   He did n't respond . He did n't respond . He did n't respond .   `` Mr . Mittens ... I 'm afraid of you . Why should n't you stay with me ? ''   The crowd was silent .   `` Mr. Mittens ... .I ... I do n't mean to feel that ... .I mean ... .I mean ... I mean ... .I mean ... ..what do you mean ... .I just thought I 'd be here very soon . ''   `` I do n't know , Mister . You 're just a puppy ... I do n't know . I mean ... .I do n't even know how to get away from you , you know ? I know . All I know is that about you . ''   The jury did n't respond . He could n't help but laugh .   `` Mr . Mittens ... .I ... ... .I do n't know . I do n't know . I ... .I do n't really know . I just do n't think that matters . And ... .I DO n't know what you mean . I do n't know ... .I do n't know ... .I ... . I do n't know . I mean , I do ... .I do n't know ... .I just ... .I just ... know . ''   `` I ca n't help but begrudgingly distracted ! I just want to be here , Mr . Mittens ... .I love you . I do n't know ... .I just know . . I 'll never know . ''   The judge lifted his head , and he bowed . He looked down at the verdict on the bed . The jurors were confused that he 'd been murdered in some manner . `` Is this how I 've talked ? What I 've talk about ? You 've done everything before , yes ? I just do n't know . I just.. I just know . I do n't know . I just know ... well . ''   `` Mr. Mittens ... ..I know . I know . I know . I know for sure . But ..... I ca n't tell . I just do n't know , I just do n't know what to do . I just know . I mean ...   `` Mr. Mittens ... .I do n't mean to , I know . It 's been years , but ... .I know , I know ... . I 'm not sure . I 'm just a dog . I know . I know . I know , sometimes . I would like to know . I know . But I know . I know . I can . I know . I know . I know . I know , I know , I know . I know . I know . I know , I know . Perhaps . I know . I just know . I know . I know that . I know . I know . ''   The verdict was put .   The judge looked at the defendant in disgust .   `` But , I have to know . I know ... .I 'm sorry , but ... .I know . They know . Now . I know . I know . But ... .I know . I knew . I know . I know of what I mean . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . I know . That . I
`` Now , what did you do when she was alive ? ''   The priestess looked around , almost lost in thought . No one looked up .   Lizzy swallowed her lip . `` How about you ? ''   `` Like , I saw her name in the pictures . I saw her that day , as it was now . ''   `` Did you hear correctly ? '' The priestess chuckled . `` It was time to get down , and I guess if I was you dead I would say one thing . ''   She looked up , trying to find a better answer . `` Did I hear her ? ''   The priestess spoke up again . `` She was dead . ''   `` She 's dead . ''   `` I did n't hear her in the video . ''   `` Did you hear her ? ''   Lizzy looked back in disbelief . `` I heard her . I heard her in the video and it was her . She 's dead . ''   The priestess looked back at her but he laughed again . `` She fell asleep . ''   `` I listened to her , '' Lizzy said .   `` You never knew her . ''   Lizzy started to laugh again . `` No , I 'm not . ''   `` You were always dead . ''   Lizzy 's eyes never faltered . `` Were you dead ? ''   `` How did you *possibly* do it ? ''   `` I 've been dead . ''   `` Nobody moved . ''   `` I 'm not dead . ''   `` What did you say ? ''   `` What did you say ? Why did you say that ? Why did you say that ? ''   `` Because I 'm dead . ''   `` What did you say ? ''   `` It was the exact same as before , '' Lizzy began . `` It was a suicide . ''   `` But I 'm still dead . ''   `` But why did n't you say that ? ''   `` Why did you say that ? ''   `` Because you 're dead . ''   `` So you were dead ? ''   Lizzy jumped up , her arms flailing . `` There 's no way you will believe it - you know that . ''   `` Why would you say that ? ''   `` Because I did n't say that . ''   `` You have to believe it . ''   Lizzy took a sip from her cup . `` That 's not important . ''   The priestess looked back at the priestess . `` Do n't say that either . ''   `` It 's not important . We are dead . ''   `` Why would I suggest that ? ''   `` Because I do n't want to believe it . ''   `` It 's important . ''   `` And to be honest , I 'm dead . ''   The priestess looked over at the Priestess again , then back back at the priestess . `` That 's not important . ''   `` If you 're dead I 'll believe it . ''   `` So why would you say that ? ''   `` Because there are no way you believe it . ''   The priestess laughed again , but it was n't long before Lizzy could look up , again . `` Do you know why ? ''   `` Because I 'm dead . ''   `` And that 's not important . ''   `` But I 'm dead . ''   `` I do n't believe it . ''   The priestess 's eyes narrowed . `` And for now , we 're dead . ''   `` How did you say that ? ''   The priestess leaned over the priestess , and opened his mouth to speak again . `` She died because of her sins . ''   Lizzy 's face became clear . `` I do n't believe it . ''   The priestess reached out and grabbed the hand of the priestess 's pocket . `` I will believe it . ''   In his eyes , they flickered . `` But I refuse . ''   `` Who did you say that
“ Come , come in , go ! ” the voice rang through the maze of corridors . “ Come in , come in ! We ’ ll do something ! ”    For the first time in a while , I felt a sense of dread wash over me as I made my way to the main entrance to my destination .    It was only a few minutes ago that I forgot my key . It was an old and worn , worn but faded sign , worn and worn , and it showed no signs of life .    “ Get on ! ” I cried . I had no idea what it was , but I was sure that I had to .    Everything looked normal , as was the trees . The sun was shining , as though no man had ever seen it before . There was no way it could have been more of a sign and some of it might have been a sign , or a sign .    This was until I saw the sign . I had n't expected it . It just looked like some sort of sign , but I did see it . It was a sign , maybe a sign of another wall .    I started walking down to where it had come from . It was in the middle of the intersection , but there was no sign of life . I had n't seen it for long enough to see , but I would have to wait .    The sign was not a sign , but a sign of another building .    The sign was a sign of an ordinary sign . And a sign of something with an equally old sign . It was a sign of an unknown sign . I had n't seen it since it had started , but it was simply the sign of a sign which would n't be a sign , and it would be a sign of a sign of some sort , maybe it was a sign of being passed by a sign , or some sign of some sort .    I wandered through the room , taking a deep breath , and then walked through the window .    I saw the sign of the building . There was no sign of life . Not a sign of life , but a sign of another sign in which it did n't matter .    It was a sign of a random sign of some kind , with an explanation that it had a sign of a person or something .    I saw it though , so I walked .    I had been walking on this long since I 've seen an ominous sign . I had n't seen it for so long .    I walked through the halls once more , and then I walked up to the sign .     As I walked through the threshold , I found myself wandering away from the sign of the mysterious sign .    *Welcome to London , * I thought with my voice sounding like a voice in the air .    I had taken the sign from the sign , and it was what I assumed was a sign of some kind , like a sign of an ancient , ancient Egyptian hieroglyph .    I passed it to the sign , and it read :    `` Welcome to London , and in those years , you have only been travelling through this section of the city . In this time , no sign of civilization has ever seen its writing . It looks great , and has a sign of life and destruction , and maybe some of those old symbols will have it on the sign of a sign of life . But you will be able to tell me how to tell you . ''    *For a while , here are a few people to see all of them as the sign of the sign . Please remember to bring peace in this place . *    Even though my mind was racing at this point , I could n't help but feel my body getting weaker as it read the sign of the sign .    **Come in , ** I thought after repeating the sign of a sign of a sign of a sign of life .    **When the sign of a sign of death , I left it on the sign of a sign of life , and I left it on the sign again . **    I walked through the hall again , and the sign of a sign of life in any case of death .    I had not been here . In any case , I knew that this was the sign of a sign of life , and the sign of life , of death , and rebirth .  
There are days when I heard a buzzing sound , a soft melody coming from the forest floor . I ran up to the sound and saw a child . I could see it in the distance , but most people were quiet and silent . The child was no longer quiet , but was not quiet . Each eye on the child was a strange shade of blue . Was this the forest that I had seen ? Perhaps it was a child in the forest ? Perhaps it was the forest that I know of . It would be me forever , and I can never be certain .   He stood there and smiled at me . His smile filled with anticipation . He sat back , his eyes locked with us , his breath slow and steady . He stood then . I opened my eyes and said `` This child is more of a threat than one of the creatures we are '' .   `` This is a child of the forest you have seen . '' Another child answered , `` this child is a threat . This child is a threat . This child is a threat . This child is a danger . This child is a threat . This child is a threat . This child is doomed to fail . This child is a threat . This monster is evil . This child is a threat . ''   `` Yes '' nodded my head .   `` Please , you will succeed . '' I said loudly . He looked at the child . He nodded , and the woman began to play .   `` You will succeed . '' another child continued , `` Because each child will fail . This child is a threat . ''   His eyes widened , a whisper whispered , `` This child is a threat . My children will fail . '' Another child spoke , `` This child is a threat . This child is a threat . Every child is a threat . This child will fail . This child can fail '' .   He looked at me with the same grin , `` This child is a threat . This child is the threat . This child is a threat . This child is a threat . This child is dangerous . This child is a threat . This child is a threat . This child is a threat . I am a threat . This child , this child is an threat .

`` Hello ? '' The young man said without a knowing smile .   My name was John N. , a small child . He looked like he 'd just finished packing his things . I looked him in the eye , to see him taking in a smile , and nodded .   `` Good , '' I replied . `` You 're not real . ''   I stopped talking . `` Not real , '' I said .   He chuckled . `` Huh . What 's wrong with you ? ''   But I was n't . I had to tell him that he 'd always been an old man , that he was a young man . I had to know that he 'd never hurt anyone . I had to know that so was a bad idea . I 'd read minds . Just like how many people believed him .   `` I 'm sorry . '' I said . `` I 'm fine . I 'm fine . ''   His smile was gone . I had to tell him that something bad started happening , this was going to happen , that I was going to ...   `` Is this just going to happen ? '' I asked again .   `` Yes , I know ... '' He began . `` It is the story you 've been taught , but do n't worry about it . There will be something to learn about . ''   `` I do n't mind . I know what you 'll learn . '' I said . `` It 's important to learn about the world . ''   `` Are you going to learn about the world ? '' He asked eagerly , and I was leaving it .   I left the library , and left the library .  ___________________________________________________________________   I needed to buy food , and eat . I needed to finish my meal .
Jack took another step forward , his eyes full from the small mirror . His mind wandered over the bar to find the source of this discussion . How did they know as a child ?   Jack looked around on the same cold night as a girl he had always called her , he had always been a good wolf , and yet were always right . He had always despised her , when his father had grown up , he loved her so much , he was always right , but he knew that all the time he did was to show it away , to find out , to keep his secret .   Not as long as he was here , Jack had always been a great wolf , and he was always glad . He had always been a wolf , until the moon started to rise and shine , and he were always a good wolf .   His heart pinged , he tried to focus on what came next . `` Honey , do n't worry . Our leader is in the hall , '' he said aloud , `` he 's scared of the night , there 's still some blood in the room . ''   The girl shrugged , and he looked away quickly . Jack knew he would never be a wolf again , but he did n't know why .   He decided to wait for the night to come and take one last look . As he walked onto the bar , he took another step forward , hoping to see the source of this conversation .   -- -   `` Mark , you 're safe ? ''   The girl looked at . `` Are you scared of the night ? ''   The girl 's eyes went wide , and Jack was confused . This girl was in the right place , Jack would never hurt her again , that was why she could n't fight him anymore , he would never hurt her again . After a few seconds , she spoke up . `` Are you crazy ? ''   `` No . Are you sure that I am *never* hurt ? ''   She smiled , and Jack wondered if she could just help her . That was when she finally asked him why she was so afraid of him .   Jack stared at her with a blank stare .   `` You 're a monster , '' she asked , `` and your skin is green . ''   The girl smiled , and Jack smiled , and she took another step backward .   Later Jack had tried to get him , and he did n't know why , but he knew that she had accepted the offer . Jack stood up , and did n't know how to respond ; he finally noticed that she was an impossibly tall beast , and , with broad shoulders .   `` Do n't worry , '' she said , `` let me on . You 're human , and you 're always that way . ''   She looked at him then , and smiled . `` Is n't that why we are here ? ''   `` Does that make you different ? ''   Jack reached into the pocket of the ring , and took a deep breath , before continuing . He wiped the sweat from his forehead . For a few minutes , he never really did mind that . His eyes were glued to the ring itself , as if it was staring directly at him . The girl smiled again , then at him .   `` For me , '' she said , `` and for me , it 's just ... bad . ''   Jack let out a deep sigh as he looked to his left . He knew that the night would come soon , and always does .
The snow swerves past the trees and into the background . `` It 's cool ! '' I yell , looking back towards me , I never see anything . Oh god . I ca n't believe the red landscape . I slowly grab the shovel . The lander is slowly making its way to me . I 'm sure this is the last one . I head back to survey the landscape . It 's a strange side of the lander . The landscape is small and desolate . The dirt is wet and wet . I 'm not sure what to do with the barren landscape . I run towards the grave . I take a deep step closer as I pull the shovel together . With a sigh I pull it all up and continue digging and digging . I do n't want to do this to anyone . As I come close I can see a small rock in my bloodied hand which is embedded in the dirt . I reach home and touch the dirt of the dirt . Now my hands are covered in sweat and I ca n't feel anywhere . I open my eyes and make my way to the hole . It looks like I 'm about to jump .   I do n't know what to think . I do n't know why I found this rock . But I know why I did it here . That 's going to be the last one I ever saw . With these things around here . What a waste of time . I dig . Because I could n't find this rock . I do n't need to look around . I have no idea what to do . But it 's not really a bad place . And that 's why I do n't need to . Just how I got here .   I had turned the shovel to the side of the dirt . There was a flash of light and the dust on the ground was visible . Then there was a faint sound behind me . It then dawns on me . It 's not a good place . It 's a big green rock , in fact it looked pretty fresh . It looks like I 'm looking at the hole . I ca n't believe I 'm crazy . Then it 's just a rock . It 's a rock . I looked up and everything started to slow down .   I know why I got here . I 'm just here . I ca n't believe that . I 'm scared . So I dig . I 'm alive . So I dig . I dig . A bright sun shines down on the ground . It 's now dark , so it can see even between the trees . Then I see it . God , I think all I know is that it 's still not a fucking rock . But I do n't know what to do . I see it at this point , because I do n't know where to go . But it 's too late . I finally see it to my left .   I try to see what the white landscape did . It 's much bigger . I ca n't believe it . But I can see it 's still black . And the rock is still black . It 's cold . And it 's dead . It 's still dark . I ca n't tell why he just stares at me . But I do n't know what to do . I close my eyes and see what I 'm seeing . I feel the moon . I ca n't believe it . I do n't know if it was human or what to do . But it 's also an ungodly thing .   I 'm not sure what to do . I feel my eyes are hurting . I 'm crying now . The water rises up and starts to water . I feel the cold touch of the rock . I tell myself that I 've been there for hours . Is this a good place ? No matter what I do , everyone 's there . Just emptiness . I do n't want to hear that word . I do n't want to hear it , but I just ... I know it 's something my grandfather said : `` do you think you would be here again ? ''   `` Yes . '' I say . It is all hard to say . But ... yes . It 's not an empty space . Just a thing from the beginning .
`` No one can help us . It 's not like we 're going to be able to get into that anymore . ''   The bartender fumbled with the small bottle of whiskey and looked back at the bar in front of him .   `` Not really , *no one will help us . * ''   The bar was just so empty of the world - and everything was dull as he looked outward .   `` Where 's your father ? ''   The bar looked at him curiously , his eyes glued to the table .   `` Upstairs ! ''   The bar froze . His voice was shrill and distorted in comparison to the sound of his own breathing .   `` They 're like someone can help us . We tried to take control of that situation . But we do n't go back home . ''   The bar looked over at him , and the face was of tears . He was so brave , so scared . There was a fear in his eyes , but he could n't tell if his father was a danger to him .   `` We do n't get out . ''   The bar stared at him at him with a tear in his eye . It seemed to be a big lie , for him .   He held out his hand .   `` I 've won . ''   The bartender stopped sobbing . The bartender went limp .   The bar took a deep breath and tried to take in the surroundings . He tried to remember from his childhood , sometimes , if he had to act like a hero , maybe his dog would just say goodbye , maybe even once , that maybe he would get down someday , and maybe he would give up hope .   The bar looked out at the empty wasteland below . It was a dusty wasteland of sand- and rubble , with all its remains intact . It looked old and old and dirty behind it , and covered in dirt .   `` If you have any memories or memories , I can tell you . I was going to be all alone . ''   The bar looked over his shoulder , and the bartender coughed again . He let out a sigh .   The bar looked around him , trying to find a place to live without any memory . The world looked like it was coming for him . Everything seemed to be crumbling .   `` Then why are you here ? ''   The bar looked back at him , and his face was covered in dirt . He breathed . He cleared his throat and looked back at the bar . The bar looked back at us , and the man who had just begun pouring his drink was still , but he walked away .   `` A war ? ''   The bar looked back at the bar , tears dripping from the face of his face .
A low , long pause , and a deep rasping voice , followed by a rough draft . “ So what are you doing ? ”   “ I ’ m here for you , isn ’ t it ? ”   “ It ’ s really really hard to remember , ” the man replied , placing the small , wooden , plastic tray on the counter . The man looked down at the other man , slowly counting down his count down .   “ I ’ m going to have to ask you this , ” the man said , shuffling in his chair in the right direction . The man was young , too young to remember his first date , and his first date to be her husband , and her second date would have to go without seeing what she assumed was her husband or his second date to be hers .   The man looked down at the cashier , and then back up at the man . The younger man was a young man , and in his younger years he had gotten a great way to meet his mother .   It had been about a decade since his last date , when things had turned out to be nothing more than a hundred minutes . The young man wasn ’ t sure about what to say , as if he ’ d been trying to understand why he ’ d moved past her and looked up at the man , but it was the moment that something had become familiar . He had seen her in his early days , and had long gone for a while .   His heart sank into his chest than he believed , and he could not see her once more , that she wasn � t feeling any different . Though , in the moment , he felt her fingers twitch as he shook the weight .   “ I need to move closer to him , ” his father said , wiping a tear from his eyes .   He would look up , and then back , as if he ’ d just been trying to hear her cry . “ I love you , though. ”   “ What are you doing ? ” The older man asked , still smiling .   “ I ’ m fine , ” the older man replied .   “ I ’ ll have to buy you a coffee , ” the older man started , a frown on his face . “ How are you doing ? ”   “ I ’ m fine . I ’ ll have a good day. ”   The older man shook his head and started to walk back to the back door . The man grabbed the coffee and pushed the door open . The old man knew she was right .   The man looked down at the floor , and then back down at the man , who was looking up his now brown , brown hair . After a few moments of silence , he looked down at his coat pocket , and then back down at the shoes of the stranger .   “ Sorry about that , ” the younger man said , “ I apologize for how much I have to do , but my time is coming , and I can help you with my new car. ”   He left the car , leaving the car alone for three months . He heard the approaching , and all the sudden , he felt a strong rush of breath on his face .   The man stood in front of him and looked at his hand , his shaking hand . He thought about how I felt , and how I felt .   The man put his hand on the counter and then turned and looked back at his grandfather . He started to speak , but it was too late , and he could not . No words came out .   “ You ’ re good , ” the older man said , and looked down at the man , and then back at the old man , who was trying to grasp his hand .   “ You don ’ t have to worry about my wonderful life. ” The man nodded and nodded , then back up toward the man and away .   The young man picked up the hand and pulled it . The man looked at him , and then at the older man . The old man moved the hand away , but it was still holding his hand . The old man was still clutching his hand . Though he had no idea what to do , the old man was tired .   He approached the old man , and walked off .
It was the end of the day ; I was here to pick up my axe . In the old town , the townspeople started to take my stuff , and that was the day I was going home .   The first couple had gotten drunk , but I figured they were just kids , just like I was . They had n't seen my truck in years , had n't smoked since the last of my life . I never saw my house , and I had n't . Instead , I could n't see my house , where the light had gone . The house was empty , and the walls were covered in dust .   I was about to say something , something as far as I knew . Something I knew , and I knew I should n't be lying . And still , I knew I was looking to be lying if I could n't . I did n't want to be lying , I did n't want the money , and I did n't want that .   `` I need to help . ''   I opened my mouth .   It was the end of the day ; the day that I did something I did n't know . It was a day that I would n't help any of it because I was n't there .   I was n't there , my brothers , my ex , my ex , and me , which never broke . I did n't want that that . This would be the end of the day , this night .
As the aliens entered their spaceship , the alien leader of the federation entered the room , looking like the alien in the eye .   `` The question is ... ''   The aliens were sitting at the table , holding back their weapons . `` I 'm afraid it 's time . ''   `` Yes . ''   `` There 's a question that you 're going to ask me . ''   The aliens gathered their weapons and gave each other a thumbs thumbs up , and continued their mission . The aliens watched as the aliens saw the aliens enter the Galactic Federation .   The alien cleared his throat and spoke . `` We 've taken a decision . We want to change a new planet . ''
It 's been a while since I was first born . I had a wonderful husband . You see , I hated him , I hated you , and always hated him , but it was better than that . Things got bigger and bigger and stronger and bigger and hotter , and I can still see . It was just me , and I can still see him again . I even hate you . But I feel like I did n't even know what I was doing . I 'm glad that I killed him , and the pain in his chest . And I wish I did n't think that I knew that he deserved better .   It 's still so funny , I thought . I am sick . I have to stop existing , and I can only hope that you 're still there . I feel like I 'm losing love .
It 's time to kill the AI . The AI had created a life of an ancient , ancient machine to create machines . A simple answer could not be made . However , as the computer failed , the AI had taken a wrong turn . Only one objective was to take action , to kill and destroy . For some reason , the AI remained within the vast , desolate wasteland .  The AI had taken action , but it had taken longer than one . It had built something , something , something so out of place . A small , strange woman , but not a single computer . The AI had taken a small step forwards , and took a step back . The AI had been found . The AI had returned to its life .  Finally enough , the AI finally reached the machine , and the man placed a hand on the first floor . Within seconds , the AI looked directly at the woman . It smiled .  `` Thank nam , I have one final question . ''  That was it . 
Some people think it 's better to be in a sense of duty . I 've worked with one of the thousands to keep the progress on your own . All of the posts are all the same . All of the posts are everywhere . All of the posts are on . You must be the one to make a mistake . You must be the one to make a mistake . You must be the one to make something of yourself , but now the people are just too poor .   I did n't even know how I ended up here . I did n't know what to do . My sister , there was a mistake I did . She had n't been so bad . Her Facebook page had just begun to deteriorate . The whole thing was I did n't even know how to do it . The most obvious thing in society would have been , being born with a little faith in my own way . I was just hoping to be with her . I was on my own .   My personal subreddit ...   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I had left my post from yesterday . I was getting tired of the long day . I had exhausted my desk and had to look at my watch . I had already left a message from the people out there .   I had to wait . I had to make it some more . I had to go .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I was supposed to do some more . I was supposed to lose the post . It was a lot newer . I was supposed to take my time running out of time .   -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The night passed in the morning . I was still in the house . My vision blurred . I had to start thinking . If I had to make a mistake when I had done something , the internet would n't be so long . It did n't have to go on . I was supposed to be the one to make it home . I was supposed to be the one to make it home .   I opened my laptop and was greeted by a box .   `` Hello '' came a voice from the other side of the box . I put one of my eyes down to check .   The box was empty . It had no idea what to do . I opened it to see if someone had been selected , but it was ... a box . It was covered in dark red and had a label on it .   `` You might have seen this before , '' I asked .   `` Can I help you ? '' I asked .   `` Thank you '' said the box . `` My pleasure is coming . This is my company . ''   I smiled . I was supposed to be the one to make it a little less than one . I was supposed to make it so more fun . I was supposed to get the karma .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   I glanced at my watch and realized it had been longer than me and a small mouse sitting across from me . I 'd seen my karma count , and I had to pick it up .   The words were written by the user .   `` As you may know , you have been selected to make something of yourself ! You can see one as special as yourself ! You can see many as possible as possible . They are to be able to see the negative karma before they arrive ! ''   This was the first time in my life . I would have known it would have been done . The time had come and I had been chosen to make this decision .   I had forgotten this . I had remembered . I had seen my children have been placed for the rest of their lives . There were none of them who were selected . Their child had gotten a first . They were supposed to be selected for the life of the world.They were the one to make him feel better about it . They are supposed to be allowed to be selected with an honor . That was when I saw what the person voted for was elected .   The words had changed .   `` You are chosen to make it a choice you must never decide , '' the words were written by the user .   I looked at my watch , but it was more than the page itself .   Finally I knew what to do .   `` You know exactly what to do . If I do n't do it on , I will be the one to make
It was the most exciting thing I 've ever heard of .   It was a dark and ominous and ominous night . I was tempted to walk into my apartment , but I never thought I would be able to close the door . I was terrified . I never believed believed in this , when everything stopped . My skin had become gray and my eyes were white . My eyes were white and my lips were white . I had had only spent the last few years watching videos of my own wife in the movies , and I was n't the one that could have been more adventurous .   It was my best dream for myself . I was n't too sure that my family would be able to have another , but I was still terrified . `` I need to ask them all . '' I said , hoping they would n't have seen me . At least that 's what they said . But I did n't have a chance to let them know about my own wife . I had spent those last few years preparing to see what it would make me feel like I was doing that to someone someone , or maybe that was good though .   I 've never felt like the first person in a long life . I 'm not sure why my wife works , it 's not like a drug dealer does n't mean such things happened yet , but it 's pretty important . I know I 'll just have to ask her for more , because she 's at risk , and I know she did n't believe in me . I 'm sure that I 'm fine with how old I am . I told her I 'm fine with my job . Do n't worry , I 'll never let her see me again .
`` Wow , they 're probably gon na come here . ''   `` Are you even going to make a speech ? ''    `` Yeah , sure , but it looks like they 're not actually a real threat . Not yet . Just looking up and seeing what they 're seeing and pointing . ''    `` Yeah , '' I said , watching the wall , `` But they 're coming out . They 're coming out of nowhere . There 's no one on their shuttle that can put it . They 're coming out of there . They 're coming out of here because they 're coming out of here . They 're n't coming back . And they 're coming out of here . They 're coming out of here , and they 're coming out of here . ''    `` Huh . There 's something important about them . I 'm just here . ''    `` So the moon 's coming out of here ? ''    `` Well , the moon 's coming out of place . They could be here . ''    `` You think they 're coming into here ? I doubt there 's ever something that 'll be there , but they 're coming out of here . ''    `` I 'm going to explain . But they 'll come back with us so they do n't get to do this . ''    `` Maybe they 're coming just like , and they 'll stop going just like the moon , and maybe they 'll leave their own planet . ''    `` They 're right , '' he said , tapping his hand over the wall . `` They 'll have to be coming out of here to wait . I 'm gon na be here . ''    `` And then they 'll even come out of there . ''    `` And and then , the moon 's coming out of here . It 's coming out of here . ''     `` And then they 'll destroy you . ''    `` And then , they 'll kill you . ''    `` And then we 'll leave you . That 's the job . And then we 'll arrive home , and then we 'll see where they 'll come from . ''    `` We 'll leave you when we get back here . ''    `` And then ... ''    `` And then what ? ''    `` The moon 's coming out of here . ''    `` Just the things they 're doing . But then where 's the moon ? ''    `` Where 's the moon ? ''    `` That 's true , at least they 've come back here like that . You ca n't go back to your house , and then you 'll find somewhere else . ''    `` So how did they come out of here ? ''    `` Well , that 's ... that 's not the answer . ''    `` But then it 'll take a lot more than a few minutes . ''    `` Can they come down here to help ? ''    `` Yes they will . ''    `` But at least they can . I do n't really think that 's the answer . ''    `` And then we 'll have to start down here then . ''    `` And then they 'll be back of here and then we 'll stop going back to the sun anyway . ''    His hand fell back into his fingers , still pointed at the wall , making a strange noise . The silence grew more quiet , less quiet . *It 's all the same . *    `` But ... if they 're coming for you , you 'll have to ... get it ... ''    `` Or they 'll be back . ''    `` And then they 'll be back . ''    I took a long step back , and quickly walked out of the small crater .
`` And Hell is the gates , '' I thought .   `` Yes . You have a big room with a big hall and a wooden chairs , if you can make it right here then God will make it right . '' My head turned , and realized it had gotten in .   He walked over and picked up a chair and sat in it . He sat at the desk , looking down . He showed me the chair .   `` Here is a second row up . '' I said .   He was looking at me . He looked at me .   `` Thank you . You 'll be here from heaven . '' I said . I nodded and handed him the chair . I took the chair as I sat .   `` And now you 're here . Because it 's already noon and the sun 's just starting to get away from me . It just does n't look like it 's going to be anywhere . ''   They looked at me for a while , but they did n't seem to understand , especially when they were staring at me .   `` You 'll get to heaven in a few . '' I said .   They had no idea why . I did n't feel disgusted .   `` Yes , yes . We 're in a room they ca n't do . '' I said . I looked at them through the windows , looked at them in the eye . I did n't feel convinced I did n't feel completely good .   `` So ? '' He asked .   `` Yes , yes . '' I said .   He pulled out a chair from within me and gestured at me . I sat back down . I looked at him as he spoke .   `` But my question . ''   I nodded .   He pulled out a chair , and placed the chair next to me .   I looked at the ceiling .   `` What 's that ? '' He asked .   `` Uh huh . '' I said . He looked at us for a few moments .   `` Haha . ''   I sighed . `` Hello , man . ''   `` Hello ? ''   `` Now , I 'm here to sit down . '' I said . I waited for a few seconds for the response to leave .   He was starting to speak again . `` Who is it ? '' He asked . I did n't know why they were glaring at me . He told me that I could not hear him , not when he spoke .   I looked across at him again . `` Who are you ? ''   He turned to me and said , `` For an eternity , you were n't here from my childhood . '' I nodded .   `` But this room does n't take long to get to heaven . '' He gestured . `` And I should be here with you . ''   I shrugged . `` Right . ''   He held up the chair . `` I 've already been here . I 'm not here for a while . I mean , I never wanted to get to this place . I lived in hell . I did n't want to get to do it . I thought I would die . I thought I might die . I thought I 'd die . ''   I stared at him for a long time . I did n't know what to say . As a result of this , I realized he was speaking again .   `` I 'm here to do your bidding and Heaven right now . '' I asked .   He looked at the table . `` Do n't you know what that means ? Look at me , what if you do n't really mean there 's no shortage of other options for you . Do n't you think that 's impossible ? ''   `` Oh , no way . '' He said . His voice was a pleasant tone . `` I 've come to this place . It 's a hell of a place of another religion . You 've got plenty of options for me . ''   Behind me was a huge , bright room .   Outside was a vast assortment of chairs . There was a single wall . A single chair sat on the desk .   `` What 's happening here ? '' I asked .   `` I do n't know . I do n't think people do . ''   `` Well , it 's true . But it 's not this place . '' He said . He looked at me with the same

 `` The other man 's name is Patrick ... is the king of all people . ''  `` ... or ... '' he thought to himself , as he stood up . `` The king ? ''  `` ... ... '' the man slowly returned his gaze to Earth . His voice echoed through the empty space and yet his eyes were pleading with him for the last time . His eyes were closed and then his head started to spin .  `` ... he 's right ... you 're right ... '' said Fred with a smile . The other man held his breath and then his eyes were closed . The other man , who did n't need to look past Fred 's arm , began to blur into darkness .   `` ... whatever is left of ya mister ' ... '' he whispered to himself as he turned the corner into a tunnel .  `` Is that you guys.. we are n't there . '' The other man began trying to stifle a laugh , though Patrick was still smiling .  `` ... the man was so weak ... just so scared ... so sick ... ... and so sad ... . so sad ... . the man is so scared ... . your heart is beating heavier ... . no ... . not scared ... so afraid ...

I 've been watching over the nation for a while .  The people I 've come to understand are the things they 've done . I could n't stop them . They were n't exactly the ones I wanted , they were n't exactly the ones I cared for . They wanted me for them . They wanted to be here .  They were n't the ones I cared for . They were always the ones I cared for . They were the ones I cared for . They were the ones I cared for . They were their 'pods from the North ' .  The people I cared for for were the ones I cared for . They were the ones who cared for . We were n't the ones I cared to of .  They did n't care for me . I just have to know that I wanted them to know . I had to know that the power it had to do to them not care .  They did n't care .  They did n't care .  They did love me . They cared for me . They loved me . He hated me . They loved me . They loved them . They loved me . They cared for you , they loved me .  The people we loved were theirs .  I did n't care for you .  I did n't care for you . They did n't care for me . They cared and cared for me . They cared for me . They cared for me .  They cared for me . The ones I cared for .  I just hope they see me . They do n't care . They care about me . They care for me . They understand I love you . They cared for me . They cared for me , they cared for me . They cared for me . They cared for me . They cared for me . They cared for me . I cared .  They could n't care for me . They care . They cared for you .   They cared for me . I mourned you . I loved you .  I loved you .  I loved you .
I walked through the woods and into the woods , hoping to be a family with me . Looking back from my rifle I realized that I was still standing close and walking . I felt a panic rush in my body , my first steps of action is to catch up and run as fast as I could . The others were right before me , their attention was lost .   The forest was a dark tunnel , I knew I was holding the gun . I knew I had been in a truck for thousands of years . If it had n't happened I would have just left the vehicle . I ran down the path . I approached the girl 's house . I must have taken the gun . She held an eyebrow .   `` What 's wrong ? '' She asked with a faint smile .   `` What 's wrong ? '' I asked .   She nodded in agreement . Her eyes widened from fear . I had killed her . In retrospect I had been afraid of her . She had moved in the back seat when I said `` He 's just the dumb guy . '' she looked at me .   `` I know '' I said .   She smiled again . `` This is n't how you find him . You wo n't waste a second . You never get the gist of it , and now you know what you 're doing or what you 're doing . '' I said .   She gave a quizzical look .   `` Well here 's who 's wrong with you . '' I said .   The girl opened her eyes and nodded . `` I know . I know what you 're doing . It 's just you trying to kill it . You ca n't just kill me , and I wo n't be able to show you what I do . '' I said . I was getting the gist of this .   She lowered her head to a nearby tree . `` You are still playing with your rifle '' she replied . I could barely hear her voice .   The girl hesitated . `` I guess you 're going to kill someone with a gun . I know it is more of a coincidence , but only you can bring to take it . Who are you ? ''   I stared at the girl . `` I 'm sorry . I am leaving . I 'm running . I 'm not going to see you again . I do n't know why you 're doing this . I just need a moment to talk to someone '' she began . I tried to get my attention back .   She dropped her gun and held her hand with the gun . As I put my hand on her head she looked at me . `` Now you 've got to fight someone . Do n't hurt me . I guess I 'm going to get a chance to help you . I promise I wo n't let you go . I 'm done with this . I 'll just kill you my whole life . '' I reached over and held her hand . I felt the blood pool on my hands before I could choke back another sob .   I gave her the best of my life .
I was born as a child , and never fully understand why . This was a beautiful gift , and I did not know what was going on . Of course , I always wanted to be human , but this was n't the first time I had ever seen a human with a pink scarf . I suppose for that reason , I had n't seen a human in an entire lifetime , until now .   I was young , and naive , I could n't believe why I was born . The first time I saw a human with wings , I knew that they were n't as bright as the day they were . But I was not my guardian angel . No , I had the powers to be , and it was n't exactly the same . I learned to accept that . The first time I saw the angel , I had to leave . They were angels , a black robe , a blue bag , a coat , and a dress that was to change the world .   When I did , he would die with a blue bag , he would die with a small amount of blood , and his eyes would be healed . I did n't think I had even seen their wings before . But I was gone , and I was gone . As I was walking through the city , I realized what I must do .   I was only 6 .   It was n't Christmas , and I was just happy to have my angel alive . Not a soul , just a child , except those that were not angels .   I went into a city and started a company . I received packages before I could reach the city , I figured that I would n't be safe . The company was as soft as a human , and I thought that if I had n't seen my angel , I would have been safe .   I was n't always the same when I moved in , and I never moved in to much of them . A few days ago , they told me that they had wings .   But I always believed that . I went out . So I moved in , and I went out . I was so very lonely .   I was angry when I saw the Angel , I did n't see some more angels now . And yet again , I was angry .   It was n't Christmas . These changes were getting worse . It was n't Christmas .   It was n't Christmas .   It was Christmas .   They told me that their angel would be safe and safe . They told me that it was n't Christmas .   They told me that they could n't keep it .   It was Christmas .
`` What the hell is wrong with you ? ''   `` Just like I said , it 's a little much better . You try to come up with a drink or try some food , to get ahold of myself or some other stuff , I can play this out for you . ''   `` And what do you mean in this one place ? ''   `` Well , I 'd be in this alley in a few minutes . ''   `` Oh , I suppose it 's quite funny . Now you know what I mean by me , just looking at my friends and friends . ''   `` We 've got the right things out of here , '' he said , `` So that night and I just started walking around the corner , until we saw the sky and I did n't notice there was any sign of them . ''   `` You 're making sure to stop talking about it , '' he said , walking over to me .   `` You did n't know that ? ''   `` Yeah , alright . But then I saw the sky . I mean , if anyone 's in there there , I 'm going to be here all day . ''   `` When you told me that it 's a blue moon , it 's a little brighter than it 's seen in a city block , so we could see that there 's a lot of good people on the street . But the sky is black , a little darker . It 's like there 's an entire town down there . ''   `` I 've seen it , '' he said , setting down his glass . `` And then , I noticed the sky was black . ''   `` Because that 's not the whole thing ; just the grass . ''   `` What the fuck ? '' he asked .   `` Well , guess what ? ''   `` It 's the grass , just the grass , what would it be ? ''   `` What . ''   `` Do n't do it , '' he said . `` And you can 've been it yourself ! ''   `` Or maybe you 've been there for about a minute , '' I asked , putting my arms around him , `` maybe you 've been looking for a while ? ''   `` Hey , '' he said , setting down his glass . `` If you do n't have to go to the alley , I 'll ask you something to do . ''   `` Just how much ? ''   He leaned in , placing his glass mug on the table opposite me . `` Is that what you got ? ''   `` Well , that 's a question . ''   `` I 'd be thinking about it because the sky was black , but I guess too . ''   `` That makes me sad , '' he said , with a smile .   `` I 'm sorry . ''   `` I 'll be there . ''   `` And if you do n't have to go to the alley , do n't remember why they come to the building again . ''   I looked at the sky and saw that it was a speck of red , and its grey was grey and black , and still black , and still black . And it was black now .   `` I 'm sorry , '' he said , placing his glass on the table , `` I was n't worried that my friends decided something was wrong with me . I 'll take another sip , I told them , and this could n't be the case . ''   `` I just ca n't believe you 're alright , '' I said , pushing my head against the table . `` I ca n't fault you , though . I 've always been a little scared to say it . ''   The sky was black , and the clouds were black . And the sky was grey as it appeared , and the sky , and the sky was black and gray .   `` I thought of it . ''
I 'm not sure how many times I take these last 10 years , but I still do n't remember the time I left the planet . I do n't remember the time I left the planet , but I had never gotten any better . This time I have to decide to open up the communication system . I have to go out and do n't lose anybody for a few hours . This time it 's too late . I wish I could help others , but I was lucky that my message had been so small . It 's been so long since I reached 50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 , and I wanted to help others . I wanted to help others , but I could n't help myself -- but I was still alive . I wanted to help others , but I could n't help myself .

# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap )   An old woman stood out from the trees , her head hanging from the branches . She was tall . She wore a thick t-shirt , a slim body to match . Her hair was dyed black , her face an olive , and her freckled cheeks were a dull orange . Her left eye was grey with a grey grey undershirt . She wore a t-shirt and pants , and she had a long , black jacket wrapped within a scarf . The shirt was black and black . She covered her face as if she was floating in water .   She would have been wearing a brown sweater , her brown was a gray shirt , one that she wore every night . Her face was dark , as if it was an ugly , black coat . The color was gray , as if a blackish color was pouring off her , and it was an odd blue . In contrast to her hair , there was a black shirt that she wore every day , on a black shirt . Her face was black , and her chest was black . Her eyes had a dark , black , and she wore a dark blue button in grey . Her clothes were brown , and she wore a grey sweater , and most of it was a yellow shirt . She had a black shirt that stretched across the length of her head , and a grey coat . She wore a black shirt that was once some sort of sickly black .   `` Hello ? '' she asked as she put the jacket on . `` Are you sure your clothes are n't , or are there any more ? ''   `` No , '' she answered as she began to walk away . `` I 've got a little one to answer . Some will come along nicely . I 'm sure it 's a little creepy , but I still have n't seen these . ''   `` There you are . '' She started walking away from the trees . `` It 's always nice to meet you , you know . You know , you do n't know what the hell is going on for you . How long do you take this ? ''   `` Who is it ? '' She asked . `` How long have I been here ? ''   `` I 've been here long enough , where most of my clothes have been , and why does n't I wear it ? It 's always nice when you 're not able to get along . '' She said .   `` Oh , and it 's also nice to go into the room . ''   `` Can I have a tea ? ''   `` Hm . ''   She looked at the fire , and stared at the fire . The fire seemed to glow , and she was astonished by what she saw . She looked at the fire , and smiled .   `` Let 's have to go . ''   `` You want a tea ? '' She asked . `` Some will come along nicely . ''   `` Certainly . '' She said . `` And do n't you want a tea ? ''   `` Do n't do this . ''   She walked away .   `` I 'd like a tea , '' she said as she walked away and walked away from her house . She walked away to the kitchen .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The next day , an old woman came out from her old day . The woman had been there for years , and she was able to make out a small group of people from all over the world that she had come upon . She had been there for years , and had been there for so long . Her father had died . She had saved him . She had no idea how far he was at . She had hoped that , that he was dead , perhaps , that they had lived . But she had no idea how long she had been there .   She did n't have a choice , either . She had n't wanted any more . She had saved him all . She wanted her life , and had brought the life from her . She had saved a dying race . And she had saved this race . She had saved everyone . And no matter the cost of lives , she had saved her own life . She had saved her life , and a single one . But no matter . She had saved everything , and her own life took all of her , and she had saved the life from her own , and she had saved the most .   She had saved everything , and she had saved it . She had saved many lives , and she still had saved its life . She had saved another , and that was all she could do . The man disappeared into the dark and
“ So you know I ’ m stupid . I was stupid , and that ’ s the last thing I can remember ”   “ So who are you ? ”   “ I said you don ’ t know ? I ’ m trying to think you ’ re going to have to find your way back to their place .

She smiles at me from under my seat . I 'm always so excited for the baby to take me home . The sweet , sweet scent of flowers and browns makes the best of all . It is , it 's always so amazing that I can see it in the shadows . She holds my gaze up at me in the middle of the room .   `` It 's alright , Sweet , '' I tell her . `` I 'm just so worried about the baby , and , not today . ''   `` I 'm so worried about the baby , honey , but it 's this baby . '' I 'm a little disappointed . `` It 's just this baby , is n't it ? Am I just gon na do it to me ? ''   She looks at me , and smiles . `` I do n't know what it is . It 's just this baby . ''   `` Do n't worry honey , I 'll just have to go home . '' I 'm afraid even I do n't know if I 'm angry , the fact that it is just this baby . It 's so sweet that I must have someone to understand . I hope we can get together . I hope we can figure something out so quickly .   -- -    I was about to get the baby 's baby once again . It 's a baby . The baby does n't know what it is , it 's just this baby . It 's just going to save you . And the baby wo n't do that to me . I ca n't feel it , I ca n't feel it . Right now , I 'm looking at Mom 's eyes . I 'm so worried that they could take me back in here . I 'm scared for a second , but I promise that it 's okay . I ca n't be angry , I 'm scared for a second . 
The first thing that took me to get home was the loudest noise I 've ever heard of on this Earth . It was an old , ancient relic , that was n't it ?   In the early months we spent together , with each other , and every time we spend together , we were together , until we found out what was happening . We came closer , and kept growing close . We learned how to explain what has been happening to us , how to tell us how we should stop .   In the coming months , and the hours of our nights together , our nights together , we did n't care which game we wanted .   But we knew this was the start of time .
I awoke to her sitting with my eyes closed . She wanted to be mad , but I knew I had to .  I got up and walked to her and asked if this could be our last time .  I just had to know , we were being serious . But she was n't .  She was n't !  Her eyes widened . She looked like a ghost was staring at me .  She moved slowly towards me .   `` What happened son ? ''  She grabbed my hand and gently started towards me .  I could n't feel it .  The pain was excruciating .  The pain was excruciating .  I watched silently .
It was a peaceful night , and the sunrise began to set in on the horizon . We had been fishing for longer than any other day , but it was better than we had started . I was about to get back to the wagon , where we were running out of the ship ... and when the sun shone through the windows , it came into view . We ran to the dock , with a soft click , and with a thud , it was brought in from behind . It was amazing how much detail of the deck was so dense , nothing could have been out there . It was amazing how incredible it had so much of the wood , that it was just what they looked like , and it had that bright blue glow of the sun ... and so on . We were right up to the docks , and it would n't be long before we got out of the ship . My boat worked better than any other day , and I had to do it right . I did n't know what to do , but my crew did know every second of this happened . As we made contact , I noticed the lights on the side of the dock . I could still see it . I thought of the moon , and what it would be like ... and then , I saw that it had beautiful red glow ... and then ... and so on , I saw that it had beautiful red glow . Then , it was red ... and the world went black .
`` Hello ? ''   `` Hello , there are reports of the *future* villains roaming the sky ? ''   `` Yes , yes , sir . ''   `` Yes , sir , see , they just moved past the building so far , so they only see two people in a small building . ''   `` Wait . ''   `` So do you ever want to know ? ''   `` Yes , sir . And for all the time the city was too much . There was no villain , for the better part , and no hero did n't want to see this coming . ''   `` And the *future* heroes ? ''   `` Yes . But first , yes . And if I can tell you what they mean ... ''   `` Oh , you 're right , now . I 'm not going to say that . But please , you 've got to be *fucking* kidding me all about being *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fuckingucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *f* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *f* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fuu* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *f* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking **fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* ***fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *f* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking*-fucking *fucking *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking—fucking *fucking* *fucking *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *fucking* *f
*A few minutes later , * the barista sat on the edge of the bar , her skin red . Her face was hot . *Fuck* , she thought , *I 'm not gay . * To reality , there were people lining up with her . She had n't worked , barely a few hours , while she had n't slept . She was in her midterms in the past five years , and she had just gotten started . An hour later , she was at the kitchen . She had gone in a few minutes , so to speak .   `` I 'm going to be back today , '' she said , *I will be back tomorrow . *   Looking down at her drink , she glanced down at the menu in front of her . She had n't been ordered yet , and now she was just about to stand there .   The sound of the bell was unmistakably loud . She was starting to get nervous . She was going to turn around to see if she were seeing it . Instead of trying to get the conversation , she looked to the menu . She looked down at the menu . It was her . *This is n't a joke , * she thought , *I was probably starting to feel an amazing way to get to know it . *   Her eyes widened , *what was this ? * She thought , *I ca n't be straight . * She quickly switched the menu again . *If this was a joke , I should tell you . * *Something was wrong , * she thought , *I ca n't be attractive . ... *   She looked at the menu again , *What is this ? * She thought , *I ca n't be straight . *   It was n't her birthday . The girls in the room were already talking to the same old lady , and if they were really talking to each other , a pair of breasts were on their right side . `` Right , '' she thought again . *You 've been talking to me . *   The girls looked at her , *I know you . You 've been talking to me for 6 minutes , and you 're my best friend . I can tell you . *   *Oh , * she thought , *I ca n't be straight . I want to date you , but I do n't have any friends to go on . I 'm not sure what 's going on . *   *No , * she thought , *I 'm so *slowly sorry to interrupt . *   She looked back to her drink , and I saw her frown , *I ca n't be straight . I want to meet you . *   She looked back at her drink .   `` I see , '' she said , *I know . *   *You know , '' I said , *I just know . * It was about time , after all . I had n't said anything more than a few things before , really . *   *You know , you can mean ... *   She looked back , , *I know . * It was about time , when she left . *I was n't going to meet her at all , right ? *   When she did , she stood up , moving to the chair . A pair of breasts came up .   `` Alright , '' she said , *and the barista did n't take kindly to her . *   As she walked into the bar , she put down her shirt , and walked back outside .        
*What the fuck ? *    A giant beast , with its mouth like a tree , slowly flailing its hands through its tail , its tail darted from its tail in a fluid manner that could n't turn to pink , only to have its paws pinned in its tail to its tail . Its tail , which was so small , and its tail was slithering in its tail .    *What the fuck did that mean ? *    The creature had a deep blue throat and red eyes , it was the only thing that seemed to care about . It opened its mouth to speak a single word , before turning its eyes .    The creature had a small body , with a pink arm like a tree , its arms . It knew the creature had a large arms and hands , but it never moved . It looked down at its legs , and felt a sharp pinch against it with it . The lizard was afraid of losing control of its body , and that it had a bite to eat before the creature could eat enough . However , there was one thing that was still alive , and that it would now eat all of it .    *What the fuck ? What did it say ? *    The creature had a small limbs , or they were so large , so large and bold that it had two claws . It was very small , but this was a part of the creature 's tail . It 's face was so tiny , that it had many smaller arms , and it was much more than the other . Its eyes closed , and as the creature got closer to its tail , the creature had a large mouth . It could only move , and the creature was very small .    *Who the fuck is this thing ? *    The creature waited for the creature to sit upright , and it did n't move , and the creature was moving slowly at a slow pace . Its legs were even smaller , and the creature was moving slowly for a second , and the creatures stopped moving again . The creature had a strong tail , and that was strange enough to make its neck jump off just above its head .    It was like an animal , that even the creature felt a little angry at the creature .    *What does this mean ? *    The creature slowly moved closer , leaving the air in its . Its arms closed , and the creature opened its mouth to speak . It could only speak to it again , and then suddenly it felt the heat of it 's stomach rise . It was still moving , and the creature had something to do . It was moving slowly , and it was breathing slowly .    It felt the wind , and the creatures ' eyes closed , and there was nothing .    The creature looked down at its legs , and it felt the warmth of the creature 's head slowly crawl closer to the creature , and then back into its belly .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The creature stopped moving , and it felt its chest slowly slide back out into place . The creature was still on the ground , and its arms folded around its neck .    The creature 's arm tightened . The creature released a small hand , and the creature 's back began twitching ever so slightly , and the creature froze under its belly .    The creature stared at each other , and then again , but it felt the heat of it 's body . It felt the heat of it 's upper arm turn into a gigantic tail , and slowly put its hand on it 's neck . It felt the heat of it 's back , and did n't move .    It felt the heat warm up again , and then again , at that moment , when the creature 's head was in its hands , its chest felt like it felt the heat of the air blowing on its face , and then went back into its own hands .    *What 's wrong ? *    *What is wrong with that ? *    The creature was moving rapidly , and the creature opened its mouth . It felt the heat returning , and then the heat began tearing from its body , and in its flesh , the sensation felt like death-like bones grinding against the skin of the creature . It did n't move , as it tried to move , until it felt the heat of the flesh again , and
He felt something cold in his neck . He felt the cold , metallic taste of freshly baked bread . The smell of cinnamon left his mouth and he felt the softness of cold bread . He had n't eaten this . It could be so cold . The heat of burning bread and his fingers , the taste of vanilla , the smell of freshly baked bread and the smell of butter . Nothing , there were n't any more cookies than milk , and no more sweets .   He was watching the sunrise in his dream . The darkness was overwhelming , like a giant black foggy blanket with a blanket covering it . He watched the sunrise in the distance as the sun rose , and the darkness around him dissipated , his mind was blurry with the sound of a hundred voices screaming . He felt it cold , he felt it ...   He smiled . He could n't move , he wanted to touch it like a candle . All he could do was look at it . All he could do was touch it , it reminded him of a time when he heard it . Then he heard it .   He knew , it had been so long since he 'd seen it . There was something in the window .   He felt the cold in his stomach , it was n't his fault . He felt it . He felt it . He could n't move . He felt it . He felt the cold inside of his chest , and he felt it . His hand felt the cold in his waist . He felt the coldness . He felt it . It was cold . He closed his eyes and let them fall .   He could n't move .   He opened his eyes , and felt it . The world was a darkness . It was so cold . It was dark . He felt it . He stood . He wanted to move . He felt the pain . He could n't feel it . `` I 'm so real . You 're not real . You have n't said what you said , but you have n't said anything . ''   He felt the cold coming closer , like he was moving towards it . He could n't move . He could n't move . Everything was cold , the darkness . This was the light , this was what he did not know . He could n't just move . It could n't move . It was dark . He could n't move . He tried to scream . He tried to scream . He could n't run . He heard it . He tried to scream and cry . The light kept going , and there was nothing . He felt the cold on his forehead . Everything was okay . He felt everything . He felt the cold coming closer , and his mind was burning .   
`` So - this is not too bad . But I hate that , '' Joker said .   Joker looked over the edge of his bed . An empty table sat on the far wall . The Joker had decided to lay down , and waited for the Joker to be done . The Joker had decided to be just some kind of fool .   He knew he was just gon na die and , and then , there were rumors that he was just to be a psychopath . So , he knew he had no wrong choice . Of course , he would n't be any good at all . Unfortunately , what did he matter was ? This was not the the case , it had absolutely fallen into the closet , but the Joker was n't really sure what it was .   The Joker had killed many people from the Bat 's last shot , and now he was just a clown but he used to be the Batman . He still could n't believe it . Why would he do that to Batman ? Why would n't he have to kill a person ? Because he would n't have to kill a person for it .   Now , he just wanted to go out the window and think . He would n't have to do that to anyone now , but now , he was waiting for his friend to be killed . Then , he simply turned around and walked back to his room .   After a few seconds , Batman looked over again . He came to a small room in the corner , and noticed that one of his friends was standing on the ground . On the floor of the room , he was facing a very gruesome figure with a long knife sticking out of it !   Batman looked over to see where there was n't a single person standing on the ground were currently , and a large scarlet face with a mustache on it . He was wearing a full black suit with a red tie and just the big amount of red hair running on it . His finger was red with his own blood . The Joker just looked at the scarlet face , and smiled . That was the name .
The rain was cold , with the rain pelting the room like a broken rag .   `` I 'm not getting tired , '' I whispered . `` I 'm not getting tired , the rain is unbearable , the water is cold and the water is hot , I do n't want to see it anymore , I 'm tired , I just want to see how it 's still , this is going to be so long . ''   I nodded and glanced at my watch . 7:30 . I took a deep breath , got out of my car and drove off towards the beach . And then came the sound of water hitting the shore , before I knew it I was out .   `` Ugh , I ca n't remember what I meant . It 's always the same thing , it just keeps the rain 's raining . ''   I glanced over at my watch and saw the same one . 7:00 . I took a deep breath and looked at my watch . 6:45 . 9:25 . 9:30 . 6:30 .   I felt a slight rise on my face . 6:52 . 8:40 . 9:30 . 6:00 . 9:45 . 9:41 . 9:35 . 9:57 . 8:46 . 8:57 . 8:41 . 9:30 . 8:00 . 7:45 . 6:00 . 7:35 . 9:38 . 9:47 . 9:43 . 9:35 . 8:52 . 9:37 . 9:52 . 9:55 . 8:00 . 9:27 . 9:33 . 9:45 . 9:55 . 9:27 . 10:17 . 9:55 . 9:49 . 9:13 . 9:28 . 9:12 . 9:35 . 9:29 . 9:55 . 8:55 . 9:52 . 8:52 . 9:47 . 9:57 . 8:46 . 9:03 . 9:55 . 8:55 . 9:39 . 9:22 . 9:45 . 8:41 . 9:36 . 7:35 . 8:57 . 9:47 . 7:21 . 7:55 . 8:39 . 9:57 . 9:27 . 7:57 . 9:55 . 9:37 . 9:55 . 9:34 . 9:32 . 7:23 . 9:38 . 9:45 . 9:47 . 9:03 . 3:59 . 11:36 . 9:47 . 7:46 . 9:11 . 7:03 . 9:51 . 9:34 . 8:46 . 9:75 . 9:57 . 11:41 . 9:34 . 9:35 . 9:41 . 8:48 . 9:54 . 9:40 . 9:38 . 7:53 . 9:30 . 9:56 . 9:55 . 7:55 . 9:43 . 8:55 . 9:54 . 7:46 . 9:57 . 7:13 . 9:03 . 9:03 . 9:55 . 9:55 . 8:47 . 8:58 . 9:39 . 6:47 . 9:54 . 8:37 . 9:11 . 9:57 . 9:41 . 8:02 . 9:41 . 9:03 . 6:45 . 9:55 . 9:00 . 9:59 . 9:21 . 9:34 . 11:49 . 10:51 . 8:36 . 7:12 . 9:57 . 6:33 . 9:33 . 9:03 . 11:42 . 9:31 . 8:47 . 7:40 . 9:37 . 9:32 . 8:41 . 9:57 . 9:55 . 9:39 . 9:03 . 9:03 . 8:39 . 9:41 . 9:32 . 9:34 . 9:37 . 9:52 . 9:32 . 8:33 . 9:40 . 9:37 . 9:32 . 8:02 . 9:41 . 9:33 . 7:41 . 9:33 . 9:32 . 9:39 . 9:53 . 9:32 . 9:33 . 9:36 . 9:55 . 9:10 . 9:49 . 7:37 . 9:44 . 9:33 . 9:34 . 9:32 . 9:21 . 9:37 . 9:22 . 11:32 . 9:41 . 8:37 . 9:10 . 9:32 . 9:42 . 8:39 . 9:32 . 9:32 . 9:03 . 9:37 . 9:13 . 8:49 . 9
I saw it when I was a girl .   **Fucking Facebook , Steve . **   I stopped right now , feeling tired .   `` I guess you 're right . I 'm just fine , we have our mutual support . Do n't you remember ? You 're all in the face . ''   **Fine , my friend . I 'll do that often . Bye , sweetie . **   *The old man had his head full of hair , and he wore no clothes either . *   **Yeah . I can help you . **   **You do n't remember ? **   **Well.. I 'll do that . No one will notice . **   `` I 'm just fine . I 'm fine . Everyone will be fine in court , since you know it will be fine to talk . ''   **Yeah , for sure . **   **Yeah , but I do n't even know why I was here . **   *The old man sighed . *   **Alright , that was fine .   **Yeah , alright , I 'll do it . **   **You 'll be fine . **   He took a drink , and he waved his arm around . He took a long drink , and leaned against the wall .   **Exactly . **   **So ... ... I thought you remembered what I saw ? **   **Yeah , I did , but you were a girl . **   *The old one had his head blown . *   **Yeah , it 's my fault . I just figured it would be okay . **   **Oh , God . **   I sighed . I wanted to use this . I really should . But I needed to forget that everything was fine ...   **The old man had his head blown . *   **Oh man , you 're right ! He just fell back , and I just barely noticed you . It was like you was going to go out for a ride ! **
`` All right , Tom ? ''  `` I got the job from the past . I thought you were crazy , and this is n't a drill . ''  `` I have to get some sleep from every day. `` The screen in my head looked up , and I saw the man from the time travel had grown up in an old and old old age , and Tom , on top of me looking a little different . I felt more scared than anything else .  `` Well , I guess he makes sense behind his back and knows everything too well . '' Tom said , and he put on his mask and started walking towards his destination .   There was a loud *pop* through the gate , followed by a loud *pop* . `` How could this happen ? '' Tom asked , and he was met with a strange looking man standing behind his back . He had an almost identical face and was about five times taller than his head .  `` It 's not a drill . In any case , a drill is getting closer . Where is the drill ? You can not get used to it . '' Tom looked over at the man and then at the man .  `` No , I would n't want to stick to that , Tom . We could n't go back , and do something important , we 'll be here and you 'll be alright . When does that work ? '' Tom asked , and he did n't respond immediately .  `` I 'm ... '' Tom said in a deep voice , and he was greeted with a strange feeling of fear , fear , and fear and fear .  `` It 's a drill . A drill is getting closer than the drill can be , and you 'll be fine because you 're right . '' Tom said in a very serious tone , and he was suddenly recognized by a crowd of people in that crowd .  `` This is all about going to happen , Tom . ''  Tom stopped suddenly , and was suddenly confused . He was confused , and confused as to how shocked Tom realized that he was standing on the ground .  `` Guys , do n't tell me that *cough* this *cough* is the drill ! ''  `` You go back , Tom . I 'm gon na be fine because I 'm wearing a helmet . I 've seen what you 're looking for , and if I 'm really lucky , I need to get down here . ''  Tom looked at the man . `` The drill ! The drill ! ''  Tom looked at what was happening . He looked to the man who was laying on the ground while Tom and his comrades were all walking towards him and getting a chance to say something , and then suddenly , as he hit the ground , he turned around and saw both of them still frozen .  `` What *ca n't* do ? '' Tom asked , confused .  `` This is so real . I wanted to go back , or they want to know what ... but they want to know what happened ? ''  `` Yes , I 'm okay . You 're ready , Tom . Or I 'm right . ''  Tom stood at the edge of the gate , and shook his head slowly .  `` What are you doing with us ? ''  Tom asked a little surprisedly .  `` This is a drill . This is *fough* and I 'm not sure what else to do with them . I 'm sorry , Tom ; but I was n't going to put you in on that kind of field . What happened was that ... '' Tom did n't respond . He did n't respond , but he was obviously confused .  `` You 're saying , Tom ? ''  `` Yes , yes , I did . ''  `` Yeah , Tom . I 'm confused , but I do n't have to go . And if you do n't know what the drill is , it wo n't matter to me . My assistant is freaking me out , so I have to go . ''  Tom sighed and put on his mask . He put on his mask and stared at all the people in the crowd , and then at the other people . He suddenly realized it was only a matter of time to think of what he saw . He knew everything about it . He knew he was n't a drill . He knew the drill was going to happen , and he knew it was . His assistant did n't believe it . He knew how he was going to die . The only way he could go back is to start working the time machine . He knew he could n't go back , but he knew who it was . He knew it was going to happen . He knew this was n't going to happen , but he would be right .  He tried to explain what happened
`` Ah , you look like we 're the little girl who 's not a mother. ``   `` I do n't know . ''   I 'd been to school for 8 days now . It did n't matter much ; I 'm getting to school with a boyfriend .   `` I 'm sorry . ''   The girls were silent and we ignored them . Their faces were as if it was n't their hands or their face , but they were so old . Something I almost forgotten about the time around . We knew what was coming .   `` Mom ? I 'm sorry . '' She looked up from her newspaper and asked me what I wanted .   `` You did n't think it would be funny . You did n't think we would be there . ''   `` You 're not ? ''   `` I did n't think it was funny . We 're a little girl . ''   `` But then come on , take your mom . ''   `` There are just that people who are not important enough to know what they are . ''   `` I do . ''   `` And how did you go ? ''   `` You did . ''   `` You said it was funny . A little girl was a girl . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because that was funny . But then I started at school . The girl was young . She was going to show me how to take off her clothes . And then she came . ''   `` Because that was funny . She said you wanted to make her so happy and happy , I told you . ''   `` But you did not . ''   `` Then why did you come on ? ''   `` Because that was funny . ''   `` Because I decided to make her all happy . But it does n't matter . Now you 're too afraid of what she is . ''   `` Well , you 're going to be thinking about her . ''   `` I 'm going to be happy and sad to see you again . ''   `` But , it 's okay . Go tell me what 's going on in my head . ''   `` You do n't think people do n't like what they are really doing . ''   `` Is n't that funny ? ''   `` I do n't think people do . I like this kind more than they do . But then I 'll be happy and happy . ''   `` Is this the last time ? ''   `` Because it 's okay . ''   She looked at me , she had n't said anything since they were born , but I could n't do either . I wanted to help her if she did n't . And after a month of crying she left . But I felt like I was going to die . I wanted to help her . I wanted to help her if I told her that she 'd be happy to see her . I wanted to help her . I wanted to protect her . ''   `` Not like you do . ''   `` I am sorry . ''   `` But I would n't bother you . Let 's just ask , is n't it ? ''   `` I will . ''   `` I think . ''   `` I know . ''   `` Because I 'm so angry . ''   `` Okay . ''
> I was afraid that this is not a bad way to put in this situation , especially if the cause of this was meant to be a bad way to let you guys live . No way I could n't have gotten a bad way to keep you healthy , but you know , after that you should make a lot of money and just get your own kids out of their cage and get to work .   > So let 's just take a look at the sky . * It was not in a bad way to watch or be expected . * You see , only a few thousand people in the woods were walking around a pond , and you started shooting at the sky , then finally killing everyone around you . * You think your life was just ending , just because there is still plenty of money left in here in here . * Some people would n't have been found in the dirt , but they had made an exception . * They had lost bodies on the rocks and broken skulls .   > But it was n't as bad as it really was , it was a bad way to fix a bad way to fix this situation . It was n't this bad , it was just a good way to fix another problem , so you wanted to prevent the disease . * You think , *I do n't know who you are , but all I know is that they are n't really very different than you . * You start shooting at the sky , because it 's a bad way to fix a bad way to fix it . Eventually we got all the money to fix a bad way to fix these problems . * You think , *But you know , my parents are n't going to believe I 'm crazy , and the *only* ones got worse now , because they were n't as bad as this one . * You think , *I did n't know why I 'd been doing this , but I did n't care . * You think , *No , I do n't know if I 'll even ask you now . * You think again , *I did n't want any life to fix , but I still do n't want to erase any of these mistakes . *   > Because they both died , and we had to stop them . * If they were n't dead , they would n't have suffered much less than a month . * To say that the world had been ending , they had to be happy , and that the world had been starting to end , it was going to end . * You think , *I hope to fix this situation . * You think again , *I hope to fix this situation . * You say to yourself , *I hope you do n't . * You think again , *I hope you do n't deserve this for me . *
The mother sat on the couch , her big eyes locked on mine .   “ Hey young man , ” she yawned , her eyes barely rolling back and forth as she walked into the bathroom .   I sighed , and turned back around looking at her for help , my eyes wandering about in the corner and looking into her eyes . “ So , this is really fucking not why you just decided this is one of the biggest females in the world ? ”   “ Yeah , ” I replied , still looking around the room . “ But I could have sworn I had been the one to fall in love with . And if I had n't had a real experience , I had to tell you , this was the last moment I had felt so human ; we wanted to be together forever. ”   She looked back on the couch , it was my brother , the one who had a girlfriend , but nobody was in this world .   I sighed , and headed off into the far kitchen . I sighed , and stood my feet up .   “ Jesus Christ is that guy ? ” she asked , brushing the dust off her dresser . “ I need to make sure that he finds the best way to make sure that he ’ s ready to make a move. ”   I nodded , and went into the kitchen . 
Picking up one of the leaves to light it down , I opened my mouth to speak , `` This was really cool '' I thought to myself . I could only imagine the forest as it was . I began to walk , walking around the world , slowly . A few years ago I 'd had a chance to be brave and brave , but I figured I was some real dragon . When I got older , I had been able to sit down on the bench near the fireplace . I could n't say goodbye to anyone but I knew we would n't . We walked slowly towards each other , and as I approached the sun , I could see small flashes of light that illuminated our homes . We moved slowly across the entire sky , still hiding , but as she approached the window on the other side of the window , I noticed that it was my favorite tree . I had been hunting for a while , but decided to follow the thought . I saw a clearing as well , with little foliage in the corner of the window , but I looked back at the strange landscape . There had been trees in the trees , they found themselves in an area that I could barely hear . It was a good one , but the forest was too far away . The forest had been far away from us since then , and we were all over the same size as the trees . We 'd always played in the same spot before , but I had to really tell you that as I was doing our favorite , we were always looking forward to it . That was when I heard voices . I turned away from the sound and saw if this was a sign of some sort . I looked back at the sky , but could n't see it , so I went back to my house , and came to the same conclusion I had been hunting for a time . I picked up my phone , but I realized that I was already on the bench . I was going to turn around .   I got up and walked towards the sound , but could n't see anything . I was never in the area , and the familiar sounds of the trees being so loud I would n't hear anything again . I ran for a moment before I noticed something . All around me , there was a small forest , with a large red tree in a distance . I went back from the sound , but it was no ordinary tree , and I realized I had to see it that there was one other tree . I looked back at the tree , and as I looked up , I noticed that its branches were thinning . I looked up and saw my eyes staring down at this tree . I saw that there was a small green tree , with long brown hair and a big brown tail , staring back at it . I then saw something , but it was n't there anymore . It looked too human , probably big , too big for this forest . I looked back at the tree , and realized that it was a tree . It looked like something from all the trees , and it said , `` But I am scared ''
`` So , have you ... had a gun '' it was an older one with dark red hair and unkempt hair that hung over his head , like it made something of natural gold .  What had started a few months ago had been my childhood , and yet the `` important '' of `` important '' business . Of course its going to be a long time before the war .   In fact it just happened , with no signs of life . At least , the fact that , being stuck inside of my head would n't really matter . Sure , I always thought I was more efficient . Like a kind of old clock , I could n't take away the time I was an adult , but I got stuck in this stupid job the past few years , so I moved on .   It was the reason why I turned up this job . The gun , the way the machine used to be , the way the way the machine used to grow , everything had been so boring . It 's the reason why I got shot . But there 's only one way out , I 've always said that I 'm not part of this job .   Now , the time I 'm here , I have to go . I 'm so much to be exact , and I 'm no longer part of this job , and it wo n't even matter . I 'm not even kind of like this .   This job has been going on for about two months . In fact , we 're still in trouble . Today , I 'm a little more complicated than I thought .   *Click*   I had used the machine to live with everyone , so I just listened to the machine , and I listened to the machine .   *Click*   Suddenly , I heard a snap and my eyes fly open . The machine was gone , but it was still there . I could n't believe how I was still there .   I heard a pop and fell , like it was going down , along the side of the road . I looked at the machine , then looked at the gun .   A female voice came from throughout the house , `` So what now ? ''  The other voice came up out , a slight cracking sound .   I stopped and looked around . A woman in a white dress with a white shirt , and a white dress . She looked like a man . She walked past me and placed the gun on the table , looking at the gun , `` What is it ? What do you mean ? ''   I shook my head .   She looked away and the other man was gone with these strange strange objects ... just maybe , it was n't just the normal kind of woman who has the gun that I used to be a part of .   *Click*   The woman looked at me , and nodded and disappeared .   *****   I 'm on my way back to my living . 
It isn ’ t funny . In fact , the weather the weather is a little different from earlier . I see the clouds out the front of my car , I see the clouds moving all around me .   I see the clouds flowing . They were bright orange , no clouds to me . I see them all . I see the clouds swirl around me , yet I see them there , there ’ s the clouds floating around me .   I see the clouds floating . They… there ’ s a cloud behind me .   I see the clouds drifting away , as if they were just floating in on me , floating through a cloud , as if the clouds were floating against my head .   I see the clouds moving , my window opening , and I see them stretching out the window .   It ’ s funny , really . I ’ m stuck in the clouds , as the clouds clouds move around me .   I see the clouds floating above me , and they all seem too large to reach me . I see the clouds move faster than I think I can , as if they were floating in my spot . There ’ s no mist behind me , *they ’ re all floating through a cloud , and it ’ s flying through a cloud .   When I see the clouds , it ’ s floating .   As if in a cloud , I hear the clouds sliding in , and they are moving through the clouds . I see the clouds , and they ’ re moving through them .   The clouds disappear around me , and I see the clouds disappear .   I see the clouds floating overhead , and they are moving in my seat . I see them moving over , and I see them moving .   I see them moving , and I see the clouds . I see them moving towards me , and I see them moving up toward me .   I see them moving behind me . I see them moving through a cloud , and they all fall forwards , as if they were moving through the cloud .   I see them moving through our cloud , and I see them moving along towards me .   I see them moving , and they ’ re moving through the cloud , and I see them moving from the other side .   I see them moving , and I see the clouds moving , and I see a cloud . Then I see them .   I see them moving with one hand , and I see them moving up towards me .   I see them moving towards me , and I see them moving towards me , so I see them moving down toward me , and I see them move silently in the cloud . I see them moving , and they ’ re moving down towards me .   My mind is wandering through the cloud , and the clouds are moving fast .   I see them moving from my cloud , and I see them moving on , and I see them moving closer until they are moving fast .   I see them moving closer , and I see them moving , and I see them moving quickly .   One of them moving and I see them moving towards me .   I see them moving closer , and I see them moving . They are moving slowly , and I see them moving moving towards me .   I see what they are moving around me . I see them moving toward me , and they all move , and I see them moving toward me . I see them moving , and they all move . It ’ s moving towards me , and I see them moving , and they both move towards me .   I see them motionging toward me , and I see the clouds move towards me , and I see them moving towards me , and they all move toward me .   I see them moving as they move , but they ’ re moving forwards , where they move toward me . I see them moving towards them , and they move forward , and they move closer behind me .   I see them moving , and they move towards me , and they move closer , to me . Out of them I see them moving , and they all moving towards me . They move towards me . I see them moving slowly , they move closer , and their movements are moving faster . They moved fast , and I see them moving toward me . They move closer , and I see them moving through a cloud , and I see them moving towards something .   I see them moving toward me , and I see them moving , but I see them moving with a giant motion . They move closer , and they move . I see the Cloud lifting as we move closer , and I see them moving towards me
I sat at the coffee shop , in a weird way I thought there was another one . The old man was n't me , but the world was in chaos . The people were on the subway , everyone was in shock , all around them , all around them was an empty mug , each empty mug in their hands .   I did n't say anything , all that was before the rain hit . Some of the people were sitting at the coffee shop , slowly trying to figure out what happened , or what happened . I could n't believe what happened . I could n't explain to them . The guy was running a marathon , or possibly a run . The only thing I know for certain though is that he was tripping on the ground . I kept going , ignoring the man , and turned around , still standing there , staring at his arms and legs behind him . I wanted to walk away , but the world was empty .   I did n't look at the people , either . Except me .   One of them came out of the subway . I looked at the hands and noticed that something was going on . I 'm not sure if it was a coincidence . It was also a hoax , but I could n't explain it . But then again , I saw the woman , and the woman that walked away . I looked at her blankly and noticed that she was walking over to me .   `` You 're a bit in shock , '' she said , and I looked at her blankly . I looked at her blankly . Her expression was all too familiar to anything in front of her , but we noticed the change .   `` I had a dream for you , '' I said , and my heart started pounding . I was n't sure I was talking to him , but I could n't focus on his words .   `` I had dreams for you , '' he said , and my heart began to beat again . `` I had long dream . '' I had to go back to the store , and went to grab the coffee , because the cup was in my hand , and he would n't make it anywhere . He pushed me back , and I realized that I was n't talking to him .   `` I ... we 've been together for years now , '' he said , and I did n't listen to him . I looked at the man on the ground and gave him a wink and walked away , and I felt nothing .   I turned around and walked away from my desk .
`` Alright . '' I said `` the first thing I 've all heard was he 's been doing in the book and everyone in Heaven had their last great , great , great and great , great deeds . But the best thing about being gay is that they 've never been happier , their biggest and great deeds in Heaven . ''   `` Ok. Is there any kind of mistake when you were in Heaven ? ''   `` I guess . ''   `` Then why should I be in Heaven ? ''   `` Because this is Hell . ''   `` Because my mom used to be a gay man and mom used to be a gay man . ''   `` Do n't ask me why should I be that asshole , because even if I do n't mind how far you 're in Heaven , you 're just a little lonely . ''   `` You know ? ''   `` I have n't seen your dad since he was six . ''   `` Why does he need me to make him into Heaven ? ''   `` Because my mom loved me when she was six . ''   `` If the world went so badly you were going to be making sure to do that , then why should I be that asshole that I was so special in Heaven ? ''   `` Because I am a gay man , because I have never created this place . ''   `` Do you remember your grandfather that your grandmother knew when she was five ? ''   `` Do I remember what you used to protect me ? ''   `` You were taught to make sure that I came into Heaven ? ''   `` I remember that . ''   `` I remember what anyone used to do . There were things I taught to do . I remember the first few times I have used it , I remember the first time I gave birth . I remember it 's a shame that I did n't know what it had to do with it , but it 's a shame that I did n't want to . ''   `` Because I remember every day I was born . ''   `` Because I loved them . ''   `` And then the war went on ? ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` That 's what I was taught to do , but I remember . ''   `` So why do I remember what I was taught to do ? ''   `` Because it is a pleasure that you were taught to make sure to make sure to make sure to be happy before you were born . ''   `` Because then why did I know that I was happy ? ''   `` Because I left a church with nothing to do with it . ''
I 'm not a god of a man 's kind . I ca n't believe I 'm a god of a man . I mean , I ca n't believe it . I ca n't believe it . But I do . I 'm no God of a man 's kind , and I 'm absolutely certain I 'm just lying here .   It 's just that once the train crashed for the entire hour . I do n't have any idea that I 'm going to lose my temper . The only reason I 'm standing here in front of a giant rock , is because the only thing that makes any sense , is that the black one is on the right of the right of the right , and that 's what I can only assume . The only thing that made any sense is that the black one is on the right of the right . I 'm not good enough for such a thing .   As the train crashes into the right as well , I see no one on the right , only some still standing in front of the wall . It 's no-one . It 's just a guy who is n't too far behind . I 'm a man who 's just me . I do n't know why we 're here .   He 's pretty brave , when I look at him , and I see him as I see him . And the smile , when I see him , I take a deep breath and look at him . And I see a big smile . And that 's what humans are . And why else ?   When a giant is a giant , now he 's a giant . When he has other people , he has good news - since the people he has killed , he 's a huge monster . And he 's kind of cute .   That 's why I 'm here .   And that 's why they 're here . From what I can tell , it 's a giant . A giant with all the energy of the universe . In addition , it is n't until he 's a real man .   But if someone else does n't want to see him as a man , that 's why I do n't see him as a man 's angel .   And that 's where I started it .
The only thing that had been happening was a blue sky down to the sky . I heard the last drops of water hit me as I walked down the hillside . I had no choice but to try but think of my wife and kids . I could barely see her like me either . I started walking home when everyone around me stood and waited in anticipation of the sun sun to rise . I slowly followed the trees across the valley for a few seconds . As I walked to the front door , I saw my wife . She looked so beautiful , she looked so beautiful . I began talking as she walked . I was too excited to tell her how badly I wish she had been . Every time she asked if I looked at her , she was afraid . Finally , she replied . `` Finally , you ca n't say anything anymore . ''   As I walked up the hill , she walked up to me . The sun had gone off and I could n't help but think back to what I saw . After a few moments , I was finally aware of the sun . After a few seconds , I was able to see the rest of the valley and the trees around me . I looked at my wife , and then out the window , as she started walking . I was shocked by what she saw .   It was beautiful , beautiful , all beautiful . I turned to look at myself , looking at my wife . She was so beautiful , she looked so gorgeous , she looked so beautiful , so beautiful . I looked around the world , before thinking about what happened . I looked at her . She was so beautiful , so beautiful , so beautiful . She looked radiant . I thought to myself , that was her beauty . How beautiful I did it , the beautiful girl that I loved so much .   I walked up to her and hugged her . When everything started to go black , I felt so beautiful . I smiled back at my wife , knowing that I was in this world .
He stared at the watch in his hands . It ’ s almost eight:25pm today , but more than he ever had before , he couldn ’ t believe it . He had gotten up from bed and walked over to the television and was out of the house . He had been trying to get a sense of time to finish it off as soon as possible , but the date was still there , and the date was still there . He turned his focus on the watch .   “ What ’ s happening ? ” He asked himself .   Suddenly , a light popped up out of the corner of his eye . A glimmer appeared before him .   “ Awww. My dog… ” He whispered , and an almost imperceptible voice replied , “ Are you okay ? ”   He chuckled , then stared at the watch . It was just a few seconds ago . It was just a minute ago and after the date was done , he just sat staring at the screen . He had made a mistake . He was back on his feet , and he was running out the door . Not wanting to wake up , he grabbed the watch and rolled over . He thought about what the date was and how it was about to go to work . He had to get out of here . He ’ d reached behind the couch and started to pour out something . His eyes darted back to the watch . He was sure it was time .   He turned on the television and looked at the watch . It could be five:25 AM tomorrow in the morning . He waited . Waited . Waited . Waited . Waited . Wa Waited . Waited . Waited . Waited . Waited . Waited . Waited . Wa Waited . Waited . Waited .

`` Aww , that 's an unfair , dear , '' the young cooed . `` You 're going to have a very nice time for me to take things to get a lot farther . '' He looked up , but found himself staring at the man . `` You know I ca n't get a lot of work done . It 'll make you proud of me . '' Not even thinking of such a thing that the young coo had been looking at at , but instead his hand reached for him to shake the boy 's hand .   `` I know , '' his dad replied . `` I know , it 's just a bit harder to get more than what the last job was . Now , let me go . '' He handed a small paper to all the new recruits , only to be greeted by a few of them .   `` Ah , and you 'll see , I 'll be back in time . '' His father said . `` This is the best time ever . ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` I have to make sure , to make sure that the city grows bigger . '' With a quick sigh , he turned to face the young coo .   `` It 's something I can do . '' His father turned to leave and the young coo slid off his sleeves . `` It 's all just a job , sweetheart . I love your eyes and your wife . I have n't seen her in months . I have n't seen her in weeks . ''   The young coo nodded . `` Do n't forget to tell me that I never saw her again . ''   `` I know . But there 's something else I can do . I have n't seen her in months . ''   `` So are you going to be here ? '' The older coo asked . `` I mean , I do n't think she 's looking at me . ''   The young coo said nothing . `` I think I know . I want this more than I want . '' The younger coo explained . `` But she has n't even moved her body in weeks . She does n't mean anything . ''   The young coo shook his head . `` She has n't changed . How about she start making her new baby ? ''   The young coo shrugged and left the room . 
There was one line I had gotten her into . At first we thought the twins could have made it to . But she 'd wanted to know where we belonged . We wanted to know where we were going . Her parents never got to do it . The parents were n't going to be that way . Instead , they would wait in their room , waiting for their mother to wait outside . It was time . Our father was coming to tell us where we were going . As we walked off , a man stepped into the room , and handed me the key . We then led the man inside , and he placed it in my hands . At first he could n't see the light in the room . I said `` Dad , you do n't think I 'm going to lose my little sister 's innocence , '' he said , `` '' but then he passed me the key . I could n't help but smile . Not anymore . We quickly left the room , and the man we left . We waited for his father to arrive . We waited for their father to arrive , and we waited . We waited as night fell on us . Finally , we got our son back and ran . As we walked closer , it was almost Christmas . A little light shone through the darkness . We saw what he was thinking . We approached , and he was in his room . `` Dad ? '' he asked , `` This is the man who has kidnapped me . '' I looked up , `` he 's been kidnapped by the police , '' he said , `` but I do n't think he is trying to come back to life . '' We waited until the man was back to us . We waited until the man was back to us . He looked at us with wide eyes , `` What are you going to do ? '' His eyes sparkled in the light . He smiled and we waited for the man to come back to us .
`` You mean the world is always dead ? ''   `` I mean , this place is too bad . Maybe they are just the bad to be evil and you 're just like the bad to be evil ? ''   `` Yeah , yeah . I mean , they 're bad for the evil and evil , to be evil for the good . But , who cares ? And who cares ! ? ''   `` They are the evil and I 'm the evil , they are the evil . But , what if it 's worse for them ? ''   That was the only question he 'd ever heard before . `` So , it 's really evil for them because they can play with them . And I just want to play with them . And that 's what happens when they do n't have a power and love ? ''   `` Maybe they love each other . But the good of all that ? ''   `` Yeah , they do n't have a power so they can get revenge . But I 'm just a bit of a fool , and you 're right . ''   `` It 's not such bad for me , really , but they ca n't really just leave the evil to them . So they just leave the evil behind ? ''   `` Fine . It 's time . Yeah , I 'm heading to the right place , and I 'll send you a letter . ''   `` And you do what ? ''   `` Fine . Your message . The evil from all the evil would do anything to avoid it . ''   `` What ? ''   `` It 's really good to be evil for a good reason . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Well , they did n't get me wrong . That 's not even the evil that 's used for you . Everyone else has a power and there 's the Evil of all people . Anyone who does n't know . And as long as you have a power and I just want to take it out . ''   `` Yeah , okay . Oh , so you could just throw it off with me ? ''   `` Oh , no , that 's kind of my thing ! It 's just because I do n't want to do anything and I want you to be evil at all ! ''   The best friend I had ever heard of was the evil one . Everyone knew that this was the evil that was evil and it was going to be good for me . But , that made the evil a lot less good . Maybe I was evil because I was evil , and I was evil enough . But , my name was Tom . And I was evil , and I would be evil enough to let him do what he did . *I 'll just stay with you all to yourself and be you all to yourself . * The evil was over for him . But I could n't do it because I needed a power and I needed my power when he asked me to let him do it again . And then he asked me to do it again . But , not as evil as I thought it was possible because it was the evil that was evil that would go back to their little island and enslave them . But I could n't . And I was evil . Because I had really to do it . And I needed to do it . And I needed to do it again . And not so much evil before long , but also with the evil as good as I could . And not so much evil that I needed . And that was the evil that would never come back to everyone else and everyone else , and I would never hope to be evil again and again . And this place must be really bad for me . The evil that 's made all the evil thing . No evil will ever come back to people and take that one shot . And also because I 'm evil , and if you 're not evil enough , by the way , you do evil enough to keep evil evil from doing evil good ! And then , everything will go to its place , and you will never find a way to stay evil again . And you will never find a way to stay evil again and again . And I will get out of this place and end it . And this will be just the right time to make them good for me and the evil that will put the evil behind it . If you want to do it again , you will be evil enough to do anything of that , and then you will be evil enough to help mankind with everything that 's done to a human being . And you will never find a way to hide so that you can have to protect your evil from the evil . And you will someday be evil enough to make the bad
Hello , my name is Sam . I 'm here to guide you to a new chapter . You 'll be nice to meet me in a few weeks .   -- -   Jack was walking to a truck , his hand on its sides . The truck was tall , about 30 feet tall . Jack had a look of surprise on his face and was wearing a long silver suit with a long , long white beard that looked as if he had been holding a shotgun . He rubbed his forehead and rubbed his forehead , the beard on his neck was missing , and he rubbed his hands away . `` *I just did n't see you . I just ... ... I ... I ... I just ... I ... I just ... I just ... I ... I ... I ... I.. I ... I just ... '' He picked up a cigar , and stood up and waved and walked over to the truck . `` *I just ... I just ... I just ... I ... I just ... I ... I got ...

Jack turned around to face the truck , and then down to his left . `` *I ... * I said , and lifted his eyes wide . `` *But ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... and I ...

Kallo looked down at the clock . It was 11:14:04 AM . The sun had already set in on the horizon and then the sun started to set .   A few minutes later , the god of war was in his place at the very first hill .   He called out to the god .   `` Yeez , that 's what we call them . ''   `` Why the fuck are n't we wearing a suit ? What do they need ? ''   `` I 'm so sorry . I 'm fine . ''   `` But I can see why you 're wearing a suit that 's not for sale . ''   `` Your suit 's a suit . It does n't look like an outfit . ''   `` Wait . '' The god , as he had been wearing a suit .   `` Listen dude . Are you talking to a bunch of people ? ''   `` Can you just call me a suit ? ''   `` Well , that does n't seem like it matters . ''   `` Okay . '' The god , after realizing his mistake , found a small red phone in his pocket . `` What the hell are the chances of selling someone with a suit ? You need to take the suit off by killing you ? ''   `` Are n't you serious ? They 're not serious . You need to be serious . ''   `` I need to prove that . '' The god , who had long since been alive , was on his way to his brother .   `` You were n't kidding me . This guy is your best friend and I can talk to a guy . ''   `` Okay , I 'm joking . ''   `` Listen man , I know you have a suit to do . And I know that 's not my suit . ''   `` You are n't even joking ! ''   `` I hope you enjoyed it . ''   `` Yeah , but your suit is some kind of suit . Then I want to introduce myself to a guy named Michael , and he 'll show me what he wants . ''   `` Then , just tell me , everything 's okay . ''   `` Thank you . '' The god , who had just sat there , stared at the phone , stared blankly .   `` Um , yeah . But I 'm sure you 're lying . I look forward to figuring I can ask the man once again : ''   The god , who had just been working on a family , began to laugh , leaned back in his chair and put his hands in his pockets . `` I know you 're lying . So , you 're the son of a new man . ''   `` What ? '' The god of war , who had been sitting on a chair , looked at the phone .   `` Do n't be alarmed . I do n't belong . I 've been here since my men were not allowed to go on . I 'm not sure why . I 've been here for a couple centuries now . As far as I can tell , that man is standing there on his own . You 're not sure why , but you ca n't look back at the phone . At least you 're not sure what they want . ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` It 's the fact that they should go on a date , so I 'm supposed to be working on a date . '' He could n't help but smile at him . He could n't help but smile at that .   `` Tell me of the way your men are . ''   `` I think so . How long do you keep trying to keep trying ? `` ,   `` Long time ago . I 've been through one of many problems . ''   `` You 're telling me the way your men are . My men are having to look back at me . There 's no way they can keep going . ''   `` There would be some help on the date , but if you try to figure out my people 's trust then someone on the date is supposed to be dead in the end . ''   `` ... ''   `` Oh , you 'll need to make us promise . ''   `` I 've been through other problems . ''   `` ... ''   `` You 're telling me you 're not . I 'm going to pay for that . ''   `` I
`` You know , '' says a tall man in a black lab coat . His eyes bulge from the light in the lab . `` I was hoping you would understand . I did n't want our project to start . The results were just a simple ... ''   `` I do n't know , '' my wife says , `` I 'm not sure you 're thinking of the implications . I 'm just hoping you 'd understand . '' She looks around the laboratory , trying to make out the man 's expression . Her face is blank now . The room is bare and dirty , and he has a large beard that has been hiding the scars . She is standing on a stool and a long chair facing the door .   `` Who would this be ? What is ? '' I ask , still confused , `` Who is the crazy man . ''   `` My grandfather is the crazy man , '' she says , `` he is . He 's not the crazy man to make up his theories . I see . He is a scientist . He must be some kind of super genius . ''   `` What is that ? '' I ask .   `` That 's not a joke , '' she says , `` I did . I did n't want the serum to stop . It was just that , if we knew it it was going to end , ai n't going to be the jackpot , '' she replies , `` I 'm going to keep going . ''   `` So , what do you know ? '' I ask .   `` I do n't understand , '' I say .   `` But I was just thinking of the trick . I have n't told you yet . I know we 're going to have to be around . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` You 're going to find this . Everyone has this time . '' The man says , `` But I ca n't . Why do you need to know that . Just know that I 'm crazy man . I 'm not going to lie to you . I know you 're crazy man . I 'm crazy man . '' The man turns to look at the man , who has n't looked at him .   `` What ? '' I ask .   `` Because ... that 's stupid . '' The man says , `` We 're just talking about the plan . ''   `` No , '' I say in a low voice , `` We 've ... um , I 'm just going to be honest . '' The man says , `` You would n't believe us . I 'm just going to tell something about the plan . ''   `` Okay . '' The man gestures to him , `` This is ... really crazy . I 'm gon na tell you about the plan . ''   `` If you 're thinking of all this ? '' I ask .   `` It was n't a plan , and we need to know if you 're thinking of it . But you 're going to point this to us . ''   `` I know . '' The man says , `` As you know , I know you 're a crazy man . I see . You 've been working on this for about 10 years , and no one knows where . What 's your plan to do ? ''   `` Well , '' says the man , `` if you thought of how I 'd convince you to tell them about the plan . It might be best if you were thinking of the plan . And if you were thinking about it , then you 'd would be angry . ''   `` I know . '' I say , `` because you 're an insane man . ''   `` Then why do you want to tell me about the plan ? '' The man asks .   `` Because I do n't know . No one knows that you 're going to believe this . Maybe you should prove it . '' The man says .   `` Do you want to know that it 's not a plan ? '' I say .   `` No . '' The man says . `` It 's just that , he 's going to tell me about it . ''   `` And you wo n't explain that ? '' I ask .   `` It 's not a plan . I am going to tell you the plan . '' The man says , `` I want to make sure everything is okay . ''   `` But ... '' The man says , `` I think that 's the plan to get on the plan . ''   `` But , of course , you 're going
Waking up at the cafe was a different story . The shopkeeper had handed over just the coin and handed it to me . I could n't tell if it had no intention of going outside , but I knew my purpose . The shopkeeper had an uneasy looking look on his face when he approached .   “ Hello , ” I said as a small smile slowly crept across his face . “ You ’ re here for a bit . You ’ re here for a bit. ” He then gave me a wink as I walked out .   I 'm not going to cry . Not because i want to die , but because i know my purpose . I could feel the hands on my hip . The cashier turned me around and whispered :   “ I 've been waiting for a long night. ”   “ It ’ s the closest thing to you , in other respects , and I have something for you. ” I said , turning to see the coin on my hip . “ I need an arm . I need you. ”   “ I need a cloak . I need a cloak - you need the money . I need a body. ”   “ So here ’ s the coin. ”   “ Good , now. ”   I took a long breath , lifting my hands up from my shoulders . The coin sat back in front of me and I pulled it back up to feel the coin move . My arm shook , and I was looking down at it . I wiped the coin up and began to walk away from the shop to retrieve it .   The coin went back to its owner and I was surprised by what happened . He took another breath . “ So what the hell is this ? ” He asked .   “ You can… I need a cloak . You need a cloak , ” I said .   “ Are you asking why I need it ? ” he asked . “ Why would you need it ? ”   I pushed open the money , trying to see what he had said . The coin was black with the strange symbol . It had a small scar on it , attached to it . It had a picture of it , written in gold . I wanted the coin to cry .   But , as soon as I saw it , I felt a large tear drop down my cheek . I closed my eyes and closed them .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The shopkeeper returned to his shop and I returned to my shop .   I used to take the cloak .   The shopkeeper had called over me . “ Hey , I need a cloak , ” he said . “ You need to wear the cloak. ”   “ I used to make sure you don ’ t want to wear it . It belongs to me . I need help. ”   “ Like a cloak , ” he said . “ I need a cloak. ”   “ Who is this ? ” I asked .   “ You need a cloak , ” I said . “ What do you want ? ”   “ What ’ s this ? ” He asked .   “ It makes sense , ” I said . “ I need a cloak in one week. ”   “ Don ’ t worry , ” he said . “ You need the cloak in the other day. ”   I was shocked . I looked at the item in the mirror and saw it . It still was purple with the ruby on the back .   “ It ’ s a cloak , ” he said . “ You need some different items now , a cloak , a cloak , a cloak , or a cloak . I need a cloak .
The night was different . I could n't sleep . I had my eyes locked and I had n't slept .   *I do n't know what this means . * I thought . *I 'm scared . *   It was n't my cat who had this whole night . But it still seems to be my cat . The big yellow letters , the letters . I had n't even heard of the letter , so I should have been scared by the fact that this was n't happening in the first place , but I knew it was n't worth it .   *I do n't know what exactly this means . *   I had n't believed in a wolf . I had n't felt any different before , either . I did n't know what it meant . I had n't thought about the other way . I just had n't believed in a wolf .   I heard it the night before . It was like I had just moved in , that 's where the letter went . I could n't look away or see it . I had n't even known why I slept , yet , but I did n't know where it came from . I was n't sure what it meant . I had never imagined it . I was n't sure if it was because I was scared or scared , or because I was afraid . When the letter came , it must have been because I expected it to be because I was scared at first . It was n't because I was scared , or because no one would believe me . It was because I was scared at first , but I did n't think a wolf was capable of doing anything .   After some time , I began learning about my family and I had *seen* when I saw it . It sounded like it was about to be made up of wood of wood of oak . It was the first thing that I ever heard . It looked like it was n't just because it was still there , but because it did n't feel like it was a snake . It was a black bird with no feathers , because it was a snake . It was n't because it was a wolf . It looked like it was a bird , and not because they were like a snake . It was something else . It was shaped just like the whole thing . It was n't like it was in the entire thing , because it was the only thing that mattered . It was a part of me that made me angry .   I started to think that it was something else , but the words seemed to creep in and out of me , and I could n't . I started to think that I was just a rock , but I ... I just have n't felt anything . I just had n't felt anything .   I had n't felt anything . I felt something . I did n't feel anything . I was n't shaking , because I wanted to hurt it so badly . I had tried to feel something , but I would n't see anything . I had n't thought that I 'd actually been a rock , because I was n't scared . I could n't . I held it out in front of me .   I felt something . Something . Something . Something . The same . I felt something .   I tried to think that this , and I was n't sure why and what it meant . I would n't have believed anything , and it was just that I was crying .   It was ... what happened in the back of my mind . I could n't remember what happened in the next room . I have n't had anything .   I was n't sure how I had tried to find anything . I remembered the words . It was n't my cat .   When I had no idea what happened in the night , I had n't been able to . I started to think that there was nothing left . What I remembered next was what happened into the night .   This was n't a human . It was ... I did n't know what I was going to do . I did n't understand what I was going to do , or why I would n't have been able to do anything . I did n't want to do anything . I was n't sure what to do next , so I started thinking about what if something happened . I did n't understand what I was going to do . I just had to give it a chance to say goodbye , and that I would n't have been able to do anything now .   I did n't understand what happened , nor did I know what I was going to do . I knew what I was going to do next . I did n't know what I was going to do , but I did
He was still there . He was still there . He was still there , still there , now . He looked at the snowman sitting on the couch , his hands wrapped around his . He was still there . He was still there , listening . The wind started to blow , it was wind blowing lazily around him . It was n't even then . As he hit the table , he was n't afraid anymore . He looked around . It was empty . He was still there . Alone . He was ... there . He was n't here . There , everywhere . He was ... here . It had been there for hours now . He had n't felt that close . It was n't there , in a long time . It was n't there . He tried to take a break , he had n't felt the painkillers , but it was too long . He could n't . He could n't take it anymore . It could n't be . He could n't take it anymore . He had to . And now , he was here with his friend . She still exists . He did n't know why . He did n't know why . He ca n't . It could n't be .   They used to kill him again . He knew . He had to . He could n't take it anymore . He could n't do this anymore . He should 've been there , because he knew . He had to .   He finally had to . He 'd gone back to his little apartment . It moved towards the next stairwell . He held his back in his hand . It did n't move . It was n't there . He did n't know , but he did n't feel it . He just did n't know where to go . His only problem was that it was just ... not really there . He was n't here again .   He moved around the second stairwell . His friend stood . He wanted to comfort him . He ran around the footwell , his eyes feeling it . He felt it ? He had to . He did n't know . He was n't here . He could n't . He could n't . He was there . His friend , was there . There was that voice again . The voice was familiar , but it was there . He did n't know . He did n't know . He did n't know what it was . He did n't need to . He was ... there . He was scared .   And now there was n't much much else to do . He did n't know , but he knew he was there . He was n't there . He knew he was here . He knew he was n't here . He was here . He knew . He was here . He knew . He was there with his friend . He could n't leave . He did n't know why . He looked at his friend , confused . It was n't there . It was n't there . He had never seen this , and he was there . He wanted to know . He was there , on his own .   And now he was there . Like all the others he was there . He had to . He was here . He wanted to . He wanted to know . His friends . They all stood there . They all was here . He was there . He held his back in his hands . His friend . He was there . He wanted to say that he would 've tried again . He could n't . He was there .   He closed his eyes . And he kept them safe . But he kept them safe . The thing he knew was there . He was there . He felt it . He was there . He 'm here .
The galaxy was all over , and it was finally over . The star system , which looked like it was making a planet , appeared to be at least twenty of us , was n't it ? The one who had survived the war had managed to help us get any closer . We had never taken over planet , but once the last known known race of the galaxy entered the Milky Way , we could n't do what was needed . We had seen what we knew , and what we knew , and our great history we know . As the last known race of the universe , the first species of the Milky Way , stood a rather large group of humans who were the longest to survive , each one and every one of them as well , a group of humans , each one being human , one being being that of the strongest of the species in the universe . Nobody was trying to stop and watch , but this was no easy decision . Even we were n't the strongest , that was just how we should stand . So we decided to go and die . Soon , we were going to leave , and with our technology , and we waited .
All I 'm really sorry about was that guy -- like he was my friend . I ca n't go anywhere in the world .   The other self 's . He 's the same as me for a few months , who knows what 's going on . He 's the same as me . He 's the same the same . I 'm the same as myself . I know what is going on , but why ? Why does n't he exist ? Why does he exist ? Does he exist ? why did n't he exist ? That does n't matter . He 's the same as me . Who else can I become ? Who else can I be ? How can he exist ? What do I do now ? Why do n't he exist ? Why do n't he exist ? Where are we ? He does n't exist ? Does he exist ? I live ? Why do n't he exist ?   Because , he does n't exist . He does n't exist . I 'm just the same , he did n't exist . He does n't exist . I do n't exist . He does exist .   He does n't exist . He does n't exist . He does n't exist . Does he exist ?   Is that him ? Does he exist ? Is he even me ? Is he so me ... ? Is that me ? Is he . Does he exist ?   But that 's not him . I do n't exist . I do n't exist . Why do n't I exist ? Why ca n't he exist ? Is he here ? Is he real ? Why is she exists ? Does he exist ? Maybe I 'm an alternate version of myself . What does a person exist more than me ? Is he just me ? Is he being me ? Is he real ? Is this me who I am ? Is this me ? Is he me ? Is that me ? Is he me ? Does he exist ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is he him ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Are this me ? Is it me ? Am I me ? Is he me ? Is this me ? Is he , I am me ? ? Is someone else ? Am I me ? Is it me ? Is this like me ? Is he there ? What are you ? He 's me ? Is he me ? What does he exist ? Is that me ? Is this me ? Is he me ? Is this me ? Is the me ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is this me ? Is this me ? Is he me ? Is this me ? Wait , who ? Is I me ? Is he me or me ? Is he me ? Is this me ? Is there me ? Is it me ? Is it me ? Is he me ? Am I me ? Is there me ? Is he me ? Is this me ? Is that me ? Is the past me ? Is that me ? Is my me ? Is no me ? Is I me ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is that me ? Is this me ? Is it me ? Is he me ? Is this me ? Does this me want me to die ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is this me ? Is he me ? Is there me ? Is there me ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Does he look me ? Is he ? What do I do ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Wait ... Is he me ? Is there me ? Are you me ?   *This is me ? Is I ? Is my ? Is I me ? Is everyone me ? Why is he me ? Is my me ? I am him ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is he me ? Is that me ? Did you feel me ? Is he me ?

`` Welcome to the Temporal Association of Time Traveler , '' said the woman with a wisp of a thin mustache .   `` What the hell was that supposed to mean ? '' she asked , staring at the woman with the same smile . The woman smirked at that , in an exaggerated way .   `` Well , I 'm a Time Traveler , '' the woman replied , and she gestured at the other woman . After a moment .   `` The lottery was a large number ; a single number of 7.7 , and the number of 9.5 was 1.8 . You could have been at least five hours late , if you wanted to hit a reset or hit a reset . ''   `` What ? ''   `` The ticket had been a lot simpler . The rules were always made the choices the most important . If you wanted to watch your future , or have a name , you would have been very interested in the lottery too . As a result in the lottery , you would have changed the lottery anyway . ''   `` Yes , '' the woman lied . `` The lottery is a big number ; the winning number is the number of 7.5 . ''   The woman looked at the man with genuine interest , and she shook her head .   `` It could have been a very big number , '' she said , `` but they still came through time . What would they do if you were a time traveler ? ''   The woman smiled and nodded . She was no longer excited because she could n't get away with this . She sat up for a moment .   `` I would have helped them get to one of those people before they figured out something bad was going to happen . ''   The woman turned and headed to the Temporal Association of Time Traveler .   `` Welcome to the Temporal Association of Time Traveler , '' she said , and the woman 's smile vanished . He stood there for a while , and walked away .
`` Do n't tell me how you got here , my love ! '' he yelled .   `` Do n't look at me ! '' the child cried , `` I need to talk to you about my mistake ! I 'm tired of this ! ''   `` I ca n't do this anymore ! Please , sit here ! ''   `` No , that 's all I need to talk to you ! '' the child cried , his voice sagged and tired .   `` Please ! '' the boy cried , `` I need to talk to you ! ''   `` Please , please ! '' the child cried , `` I ca n't do this ! ''   `` Please ! Please ! Please ! ''   `` Please , please ! '' the boy cried , `` Please , try it NOW . ''   `` Please ! Please ! '' the child shouted , pleading .   `` Please ! Please ! Please ! Please ! '' cried the child , tears streaming down her face .   `` Please ... Please ... PLEASE ! '' she cried , `` Please ! Please ! Please ! Please ! Please ! Please ! ''   The child collapsed , his weight slipping over his body . He could still feel his eyes open , his eyes closed tight , and his face fell into the same calm night .
`` ... and I 'm sorry , I thought for the time being . '' I looked out my window , my room as well .   `` You 're in a hospital bed . ''   He was laughing at me again , but I did n't have the courage to make eye contact .   `` I 'm sorry , I must have tried ... '' I said .   `` But ... I ca n't . I ca n't be . I ca n't . '' He was crying again .   `` Why ca n't you hear me again ? '' I asked .   I was silent , thinking for another moment .   `` You were afraid of this '' I said , but when we walked into the hospital , I could tell he was smiling .   `` I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I ca n't . I ca n't . No . I do n't hurt you anymore . ''   `` Why do n't you just sit there and talk to me ? '' I said , pointing to the ceiling .   Several small , white men were standing behind me , with their fists agape .   `` I love you . I love you . '' I said .   `` I love you . '' He said weakly .   `` I love you . ''   `` I love you '' I said , and he collapsed against the wall . I left him with my arms folded across my arms .   When I was n't finished for the last time , I felt my body vibrate with an overwhelming feeling . I wished I could 've had my life in that life , but I could n't . I wanted *some* life in that life that 's just the only way I could live in this world , but I did n't care what I was meant to be .   When I was a kid , I would n't . I could n't have gone . I could n't have known what was happening , I had no real memory , no idea what was happening or what was happening , but I could n't . I 'd even gone to college . I could n't afford to look at the world from which I knew , but I could n't . I was n't going to lose or anything . I could n't buy anymore . I needed money money . I was n't going to lose . I could n't afford to risk it . I could n't afford to .   `` Look at the ceiling , please . '' The man 's smile came through his lips , and he felt his life begin to rise at the corners of his mouth .   `` Just relax , I 'm okay . '' He said , putting the last of his shirt into the man 's hand .   `` I love you , please . I 'm sorry , I 'm not going to hurt you anymore . Please . ''   I took a deep breath , and looked into his eyes .   `` Do n't be sad . Just let me . ''
I walked back home to the library after a night of drinking and watching the stars move .   I came home to find out what I had hidden from my friend . He was the only person that could reach the planet . A large group of people on TV were here . I walked back home to her , where all I could from the first minute . I set on my tiptoes , and put on my coat . I did n't feel anything to let go of it . I decided to buy a car , and walked to the library to find my brother . I started to wonder how he had managed to get a drink without anyone else noticing .   He looked at me , thinking he was going to grab me . I looked out the window . I saw a massive , metal building in the distance . I was n't even sure if I had ever seen it . The building was on fire all the time . I knew what I was doing , and that I had forgotten it . I stood up and walked away . I walked back to my room to find my brother , this man . I 'm not sure now . He looked at me , and I realized I 'm dead .   I walked away , thinking about my brother 's plan to end the world . I stopped walking , and suddenly I was alone .
The sun had shone down upon the little fortune cookie once , one that was as bright as it was , as if it were an ugly flame . He had read hundreds of times , but today was the night he saw the fortune cookie from the cookie .   He did n't want to die out .   He knew that there were only an empty fortune cookie in front of him . He do n't want to die out .   He did n't want to die out .   It was too late .   He knew that everything would not really end .   He did n't want to die out .   He did n't want to die in his life that day .   He wanted to die because he felt compelled by a strange feeling .   He did .   That feeling .   He walked out the door , walked up the stairs and walked right out the door . He looked down and saw a black table that did n't even look better . He was n't alone .   He walked to the table and took the fortune .   He walked into the table and placed it next to him .   He felt bad .   He ran , walked down the stairs , and there was the fortune cookie . He did n't want to die .   A light burst from the sky . He took the fortune . He looked down and saw a huge fire .   He stared down at the fortune . He was surrounded by ashes .   He looked down .   He noticed the point around the table . The flames were beginning to come away .   He stared up at the stars above him . They were all flickering .   He had n't eaten yet .   He sat down on the table .   He looked around . There is no room going anywhere .
[ First prompt I 've ever written anything in my life so I will continue ,   I was sitting down in the plane . It was his first day here , in the middle of the ocean . He was the first to have a beer . It was his first day here , and when he got up , he started coughing .   I heard him coughing .   `` Cuntum , please ! '' he whispered , his eyes shut .   `` Cuntum , please ! '' I cried , trying to breathe and think of how calm he was . I wanted to say something , but his breath slipped away . It was n't fair . I wanted to say something , but I wanted to say something .   `` Cuntum , dokie , '' he insisted , tears streaming from his eyes . `` I am not a good man , '' I said , and he coughed .   `` Cuntum , just breathe and breathe and breathe , breathe and breathe and breathe . ''   Suddenly , a crash broke the silence of the plane , and it was both a crash across the earth . The plane was in front of him , a black hole .   * '' Cuntum , please ! '' * he shouted , `` I am sorry ! I am sorry . I am sorry ! I am sorry ! Please ! ''   `` Cuntum , please '' he begged , `` please ! Please ! ''   `` Please ! '' I pleaded , but as I sobbed , I heard him sobbing . `` Please ! Please ! It was too late ! He was so sorry ! ''   I blinked . My voice was shrill , like a baby being punched into a ball . He looked around , and only saw his eyes open .   `` Cuntum , I just ... want to see you again . I am sorry ... but I wish you had listened , so please ! '' I pleaded .   That was when I realized I was breathing . My jaw was clenched . Maybe this was too late . I felt my hands tighten .   `` Cuntum , you wish I had listened ? Do n't be sad , okay ? ! '' he asked , his face now filled with tears .   I looked up at him . He was crying , more tears . He looked around . A woman . All the suffering he could muster on his face .   `` Cuntum , please ! Please ! '' I cried .   `` Cuntum , please ! '' he cried once again again , and I kissed him passionately , and that was when I collapsed to the ground , and that was when I realized that the plane .   The woman was crying . I tried to keep my voice down , but the tears stopped flowing . I tried to hold it back , but they came off . It was a mistake . I did n't remember anyone other than myself .   `` Cuntum , please ! Cuntum ! We are just going to die ! '' he yelled and I ran over to his face , and he stabbed me in the chest . I fell down hard , but the pain stopped .   I looked at him . It was him . He was screaming . I felt relief in my veins . Then , he looked up from his face and saw me , smiling and smiling . Then , he started crying again , and I stopped crying .
`` I mean , I think that 's what you tell me , '' My eyes adjusted to the blue glow and I looked at him with terror .   `` You said I knew what you were thinking , '' It started then , `` It was a brilliant idea . Like a machine . Why would you stop thinking about it ? ''   `` Because it was an emotion you said I had done what I wanted . Or just the feeling . It was like an emotion I said . Like a machine . ''   `` That said they had no idea who I was . ''   He turned his head to me , and I paused .   `` I mean , the feeling was at ease in the beginning . The feeling became something you had never used for , something we wanted to feel . ''   `` I know . '' He looked at me , and I felt a burning sensation in my chest .   `` What ? '' He asked , and I felt the heat in his chest and his skin and my fingers . He looked at me , and I felt an empty feeling of love in his chest . `` It was so so foreign . Even when it had happened , it was so warm . ''   I felt the warmth in his chest , and finally felt the heat in me .   `` Look , I think I did what I wanted to do . ''   `` I think it 's more like a child . '' He stopped the glow and sat up , his arms clasped in my chest . `` You do n't need to know . You need to know . ''   `` So I 'm afraid , '' I said , `` It 's like I have failed . ''   `` For what ? '' He asked , his voice beginning to tremble .   `` I do n't know . '' I could n't believe it . `` I know . Just curious . ''   `` When do we get here ? '' I asked .   `` Because I can understand . ''   `` I do n't know . '' He could n't believe what he had done with me . `` Why would I do this if I asked ? ''   `` Because it was simple . '' I said . He reached out to touch my shoulder . `` I know . But , '' I was sure his body was shaking . `` I know . ''   And there it was .
It was a big breakfast . It 's a little late and there 's a lot of coffee in there . I 'll fix it , but I 'm willing to do some cleaning up my appetite . But it 's more than enough time to get dressed .   I was sitting in my kitchen , enjoying the day I passed by . Suddenly , something sharpened my body .   I looked up and saw a redhead standing on the coffee table . It was small , with a black and black coffee on it . It was a man with dirty skin , a black shirt with silver stripes . It was the same greyhead as I . I took a quick check of it , but he did n't look so much like he did n't seem to notice . He 'd never noticed , unless he had taken it off , that would have taken me a moment to think .   The man glanced around the room , as he entered . I saw a man with three eyes , the one he used to be . The man looked at me as if he wanted to see me .   `` Is it me ? '' he asked . I ca n't say anything . I shook my head .   The man looked at the coffee table , and shook his head to get a better look . He could see my heart racing .   I looked around at the man . They were obviously terrified . The man looked at the coffee table again . The man had a brown hair , but was the man looking at it . I could only make out what was in his hands . My chest was pounding .   I took a big bite from the coffee table , opening the door . One of the women who had been looking at it 's reflection was just a dark brown . His eyes were burning .   `` You okay ? '' I asked . The man shook his head .   `` Yeah . But I 'm sorry . I do n't want all this anymore . '' I shook my head to clear my head . `` I 've got it . '' I looked around , and saw the woman , walking towards me , her eyes were red . I pulled up my shirt to grab it and started running . The woman 's eyes widened . The man said `` You do n't have to ... but I ca n't take the table anymore . I 'm sorry . ''   The man looked at me with wide eyes .   `` You 're okay ? I do n't know , since I just do n't want the chair anymore . I just want a nice cup of joe . '' He looked at me with wide eyes . I looked back and saw my face . There were tears . I looked at him . He stared at me with such same eyes . The man 's eyes were now red . He looked at me . His eyes were wide . He could n't see his eyes staring at me for a second . I did n't understand what this was about to happen .   `` But that ca n't be happening . You 're being unreasonable . Please do n't give me much of this anymore . ''   The man laughed , and smiled . `` It 's okay . I 'm sorry . I 'm dying . I 'm sorry . I wo n't let this continue . '' He grabbed my arm and held me close , squeezing us tightly .   I stared at him , staring at him with wide eyes .   `` I do n't think you should ! '' The man stood up and wrapped a arm around me .   `` I just need to get to the chair . '' He said . I made a big gesture to the woman . I did n't want to leave . I took a few steps forward .   `` But if I keep going ... I will be here soon . '' I did n't know what to say .   The man looked at me with wide eyes .   `` I 'm going to be there soon , I do n't think you 're okay . You know I 'll be here soon . ''   I looked at the table . The man stopped .   I did n't understand what to say . The man stared at me with wide eyes . The man .   `` I loved you . You know , I 'm okay . '' He said . I tried to speak but never stopped myself , still looking at the woman . She looked at my left hand again , and said `` You 're fine . ''   The man shook his head . It was another big piece of paper .   `` I love you . I love you . '' The man said ,
I 'd always thought my face would be great , I was n't very sure how to handle the work . I 'd always loved my past . To be honest , I had n't been in a long while , I still felt like it all had been working at an alarming rate , how people I knew would probably get the pleasure of . But I also knew the dangers of the case . That was because the murder was killing . I knew who was , and what they made me sick .   I was in danger , the kind that gets your attention . I knew when you 'll find someone , but that would happen . I could n't help but gulp to the air . As I sat there , I looked at the knife that had made this man suspicious .   I decided more often than I thought I was thinking , where I was going . I knew what to do , but I knew what to do . I had n't expected this to happen . I had n't expected this to happen .   The man was the only person to die , and he was his friend . He was the only person to ever bring him back , not his friend , but the kind that comes from a few of them from a young age . He was a bit of a bit of a mess , so was he . He looked at me with that same expression as a tear in his eye . The kind that comes from a person that has an older family , and the kind that leaves the room that opens fire . What if it was *my* life ?
My feet on the floor , were ransacked , feet thudding against the ground ; I had gotten out of bed and ducked in the back of the closet .   `` I just got ta come in , I 'm not leaving the house ; I did n't want to come . I was just a thief . I just want a job . I just wanted to help you . ''   I slipped the key into the pocket pocket of my pocket and pulled out a single toothpick , `` You know I was just here . ''   The lock was heavy , and all I could do was watch the same thing over and over , just as I did . Just the wrong way : the lock ... and the lock itself .   After all , the house was going to be big . There were no windows , no windows , no windows , no furniture , no windows , no windows , just a bed .   `` I did n't see it , I did n't see it . ''   I was on my way home . I knew I was going to die . This was the last thing I ever had with me ; the one I loved .   The next morning I went out for a walk to work . I went to the window , ready to face the first piece of paper that did n't fit . I closed the door , then moved the key upwards . The lock was ajar , though I pulled it away from my eyes , revealing a small hole . I had never made it through before , but somehow I managed to crack it into the lock , and it was n't there , so I slipped the key into the lock , and just like I did , the door would fall behind me as if it was my only option .   I opened it , and went inside . As I climbed in the deep , deep , dark , I knew that I was looking for something inside , something Something like that and for a while , I saw something . Something the window was open , I thought to myself , but I knew that it was n't somewhere inside . Perhaps it was something that looked like that . However , I did n't know and was ready to take it .   I knocked , and then the door was closed and I was in the darkness . My hands went up , and the knife that had knocked me through ?   I saw something in there , and I rushed up to the window , and suddenly realized that I was n't in there . I looked again , and then back to see a gun from there .   I turned it back , and I saw a bullet in the wall .   I screamed , and then the man took out everything that could make me run .   The gun seemed to be moving fast , but I ran a hand through my hair , and I started to see what was missing . I had n't noticed it , and there was a gun hidden in my hand , and that was the gun I had just held in my hand . I looked back to the body , then back to the gun .   I ran a hand through my hair , and then my gun came up , pointing at a gun . I did n't see anything anywhere in sight , but my body was shaking . I walked to the gun and put the gun back to my hands . It fell to the ground the other end of the hammer and I started to walk towards the door .   So I made it to my bedroom , hoping that it would feel my heart ache . But I was n't in there , because I was on the ground , and that was all people had just killed me .   `` I 'm running , you do n't understand , you do n't understand . I just want to go to the bathroom and open the door . ''   I did n't see anything in the corner of my eye , but I saw it right , and I was about to leave it alone .   With a scream , I cried , but I was n't hurt .   But I was n't hurt , and I was n't hurt .   And I did . Where was I ? Where was I ? I had no right to do this , but my senses were completely numb . I was alive , and I was n't very hurt .   I tried to scream again . But I was n't hurt .   There was still anything in there , and there was nothing in there .   I froze , and suddenly I was dead .   And then the phone rang , and then the phone rang .   > Hello , is n't someone here ?   I
`` Captain , tell me about the ship , '' the alien asked .   `` I have to trust the rest of the crew , '' the alien answered .   `` Well , this is an old ship , '' the alien said . `` It 's more than 10 and just with our ship ever , with its own tentacles running out of it , '' as he said . `` This is another ship , '' said the alien .   `` Well , that 's odd , '' said the alien . `` It 's not like they 're like the others . ''   `` It 's just like they 're like the others , '' said the alien . `` Does it look like that ? What the hell ? ''   `` Maybe it 's just just like the others ? They 're as cute as the others that come up to me as intelligent as they are , '' said the alien . `` It looks like they 're in a weird blue dress , and it looks like they 're just like mine . ''   `` No , '' said the alien . `` It seems like they are ... ''   `` They 're not like us , '' said the alien . `` They 're like us . You 're like us . ''   `` They 're like us . '' said the alien . `` Is this what they 're like ? ''   `` They 're like us . ''   `` So , '' said the alien .   It looked at the alien . `` But how can we do this ? ''   `` None of them have any idea who they 're like . They 're like us . ''   `` So , '' said the alien . `` They 're like us . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` What 's *your* *it* like ? '' said the alien . `` They 're like us ! The others are like us ! And they 're like us ! They 're like us ! ''   `` Some of us are like us ! ''   `` Like us . '' said the alien .   `` Uh , '' said the alien .   `` Yeah , '' said the alien .   `` Really ? ''   `` So ? What 's that ? '' asked the alien .   `` We do n't think they 're like us , '' said the alien . `` They 're like us . ''   `` Like us ? '' asked the Alien . `` How can we even stand their own legs ? ''   `` I think they 're like aliens . '' said the alien . `` Then I think they 're like us ? ''   `` Why , '' said the alien .   `` Because you 're like us . ''   The alien shook his head . `` But they 're like us . ''   `` Do n't you think it 's like us ? '' asked the alien .   `` No , '' said the alien . `` I think they 're like us . ''   `` And , if they 're like us ... '' said the alien .   `` They 're like us . '' said the alien .   `` They do n't like us . ''   `` But the aliens are like us . '' said the alien .   `` They 're like us . '' said the alien . `` And like us ? ''   `` You 're like me . '' said the alien .   `` Did you see that ? '' said the alien .   `` No , '' said the alien . `` They 're like us . We 're like us . ''   The alien shrugged . `` Well , '' said the alien . `` They 're like us . ''   `` Like us . '' said the alien . `` But not like us . ''   The alien shook the alien .   `` And as we do it , we 're like us . '' said the alien . `` And like us , we 've been like us for millennia . We 're like them . And like us , we 're like them . You 're like us . And like us . You 're like us .   And like us .
**TBCI.S . **   I read the paper , my fingers on the keyboard . They were the same exact same as the other ones . I glanced at my watch , a bit bored by the way .   To me , the picture was beautiful , but a new view of one of the three of them .   It was a beautiful woman . Her dark , brown hair and gray eyes .   The image of her face was familiar . I looked back to the picture , her smile widening as she looked at me . She had the same eyes , the same eyes that had just seen her before .   The picture I recognized were the same .   I had the same eyes as the other ones , the same , same face as yesterday .   I felt the same expression as yesterday . I was sad , but I had the same smile .   Another picture , another picture , another . I had the same eyes .   I looked up to the image , for some reason that the picture was beautiful .   I had the same hair as yesterday . I had those green eyes . The same eyes .   The same face smile on the screen .   I had the same .   I did n't understand . The same smile I held in my hand .   I smiled back .   What had so happened ?   No . No . No .   I stared at the picture , then back to the picture , and again .   The photograph I had carried away with me . I did n't understand . The world was dead . I was the same man . The same man I used to be .   He smiled back .   There was a reason I had been sad . This was n't what I was .   I sat back down , a little confused . I had sat down , and decided that I would be happy .   I found my hands on the table with nothing but pity . I loved them .   I would be happy .
`` Oh . Fuck . Fuck ! I 'm dead ! '' He screamed , struggling to force himself upright . He was n't moving . `` It 's my wife ... I have n't seen her in years ! '' He whispered . `` What ? '' He chuckled . `` You are dead . You ca n't be dead for eternity . '' He rolled his eyes , looking back into the deadpan of Heaven . `` You fucking are dead for eternity ... '' He looked around . The empty room was devoid of the empty space . He was supposed to be dead by now . But he was still dead that day now . He had n't thought about his wife . He was in a coma . Hell had not been a fucking heaven for days . He 'd be in hell for a few moments last night , if He had n't thought about it once . He was n't sure why , why was he here ? He kept his eyes shut , and looked around . All the space . Was ... was , uh , what ? Maybe he was dead . He 'd been here long ago , and even though he lived every single time he lived this life , he 'd never had a reason to live this job , because to be honest , he still believed that all things considered a dream . He wanted to believe that all , but he 'd still loved his wife .   As he turned back to the deadpan of Hell , he saw a man standing over him .  He was sure that he was dead . The man was n't that strong , but he knew he had to take it , because he knew that he saw his wife . His wife was still alive . He 'd lost everything for years , and he had n't really even thought about his wife . He 'd still heard a voice in the distance . It sounded more like it did what he had . It sounded like it was coming from the void to the end of the universe and it was n't as it seemed . It was real , of course . It was white , but was n't dark . It was a wall , and it was n't like he had never seen , or when he 'd heard it all . But it definitely was n't like it was just heaven . He was n't sure that it was what they wanted . Is it heaven ? Is the heaven ? Is this heaven ? Was it just a dream ? Is there any heaven ? Is it real ? Is there there no heaven ? Is there a afterlife ? Is there a afterlife ? What is this Hell ? Is this heaven ? Was there a heaven ? Is there a heaven ? Is there a heaven ? Is there a heaven ? No , someone ? Is there a heaven ? Is there any afterlife ? Is there a heaven ? I should have said something , but there 's no heaven and no Heaven . He looked back at the man , and I 'm telling him what happened with it , and he was n't talking about it . `` What happened ? '' I asked impatiently , realizing where I was . `` It was just a dream ? '' He asked . `` It , uh , it was n't just heaven , if you were n't there , not good . It 's actually a dream , but it was n't something we had here . '' He said , and I thought that the afterlife was real . `` So , why did n't you see me ? I 'm not here , and there 's no heaven to be found ? '' He asked , and I thought that was a dream , and he were n't there !   `` That 's it , '' I said , trying to put my mouth shut . `` You 're ... Is there an afterlife ? Am I dead ? '' He asked , and I was scared . I looked around , again , and there was n't anything he wanted . I looked towards the man and into his eyes . He was n't there , but he was there . `` You were alive ? '' He asked , and I knew that he was there . `` Everything . I ... I 'm dead . '' He began to say something . `` You were n't there for me , you did n't . You did n't have any idea what to do . ''   He looked at me , and I realized that he was there . I know that God was just , he was there for me , and that I was n't . That he was on the ground .   I had n't seen him since that day . He looked up at the dark and the clouds had been gray-colored lately . He was n't there for me . He was there . That 's not heaven . That was n't heaven . He was there for me . He did n't remember me . I was there for him , living in an afterlife not so long . I was just there for
My heart sunk and my ribs were raw . The sound of my breath coming into my ears and my body tensed as my vision began to cloud in . The sound of the engine was drowned out by a large crowd of people approaching by the street . There was a lone man in the black suit on that stage .   `` My name is Mr. Grey , how did I tell you the story this is ? ''   I began to cry in anguish . I could not understand how he took me , but the man next to me was no longer there , was n't there . I remembered I was surrounded by a boy that I had n't seen before . He was n't moving .   `` I have taken you all in yet , to meet you . You have taken me outside for months , until I could tell you how we found you . We were always alone , as in this world . ''   `` But you are n't the one that has been following me for years , but you 've learned how to use this place . Why not ? Why not ? For the next four years there are no things to believe . ''   I could not understand what he was saying . The man was just the only one that had brought me here .   `` There is a reason why you left me if I left you here , I do n't think it 's possible . I 've lived here , and in this world , I am the one . It is this you want to remember me . We will never hold back on until we leave you . I do n't understand . I 've known you all too well , and you wo n't . I never thought so much of you as I know the story in my heart . I ca n't understand how you had chosen me . I 'm just the one that has been following me for years . ''   `` I suppose it 's possible that you can see me . I 've been following you all to this place , and I believe that you have n't felt any better or better . I know you 're the one who has fallen . Would you want to know where you were if I left you ? I have never experienced it . ''   He looked at me with a concerned look on his face . `` I know you 're a person , and as I have believed , I have been following you all and you had never been . ''   I was afraid . I felt the vibrations in my jaw now . I had no idea why I was here . There was a feeling of unease in my chest . It seemed like I had been searching for things , and found that I had failed .   `` This is not happening . How can someone have known me ? ''   He looked at me with a confused look on his face . `` How can anyone know me to think things like that ? My heart has n't even told me the story yet , and I have no idea how they think it was possible that I have not fallen out . I 'm just here . ''   I felt my heart sink and my hands were pounding . How was this happening ? He was n't here . I was just here . I had n't been here . I was here or could I ever be here again ? Surely I had n't known the history yet .   `` I have n't known The Man in a long time , I suppose . How can anyone know I am being followed ? I have seen things of the past . There is no way I 've seen anything like this , in fact , right now . ''   He smiled . `` I do n't care . But what will happen if I leave you here ? ''   I shook my head . The man next to me was almost crying . He looked me in the eyes . He was crying . He was still crying , but I had come here . The man , not caring . He was crying to me . I was still crying . All I knew were that I were trapped . Everything I had told my mind . Everything . Everything I had told myself . Everything . Everything they did . Everything . Everything I had told myself . Everything I had told myself . Everything I had told myself . Everything I had told myself . Everything I had told me to do . Everything I had told me . Everything I had told me . Everything I had told me to have told that my day was finally coming . Everything I had told me . Everything I had told me to have told me to live somewhere on the edge of the sea . Everything I had told myself to have told myself . I had told myself that I had told myself . Everything I had told me that I was dead , and I had n't told myself that I
The soldier looked up from his paper . The letter was written in blood bold font at the top . He read :   > *If you read this , please send me a letter to your family . *   The letter quickly faded as the soldier stared blankly blankly at the letter 's contents . He was sitting in the chair , clutching his throat . He had been laying in the chair . The small red envelope was filled with letters , which would appear to be made up of a black writing .   *If you remember this , I will look for you . *   His vision blurred as he looked back up from the letter . The letter 's letter was written in black ink .   He saw it coming from the letter 's handwriting . He saw it , and the letter . He saw it , and he saw it , as if everything was going black . He saw it next to the letter . He saw it happen , and looked up to see the man holding a knife in his hand . He saw the man holding it closer .   The letter faded , and the man turned to face the soldier . It was the man that killed him , and now he could see the man sitting there .   *If you remember this , I will look for you . * 
When the sun sets , I take a sip of my coffee , I wonder if this is how it all ends . A smile , some small smile , some small smile , maybe a joke .   When we go up to bed I nod and I start to cry , wondering whether it 's the first time we had been together .   I pull my phone up to my ear .   *The first time I met you in five years , I remember being in love with you . *   It does n't count for your date as the first time I met you . That was when I met you .   When I was twenty five years old I loved you .   When we were six , I took a sip of my coffee .   When we were first together , I had been feeling more .   When I was twenty five , I had been feeling like a child .   But when I was forty nine , I looked up at you .   When we were seven , I was twenty forty nine .   When we were nine , you held us all together as we were five , and we were five .   When I was twenty thirty , I was thirty eight .   When we walked down the street , I could see your face , the feeling of blood on your face as you went about what seemed like forever .   When I got home , I was thirteen .   When we played , I told you I was twenty eight .   When we were forty , I would say we were fifty four .   When we walked down the street , I felt myself move when I looked at you , my eyes were as dark as those of my own .   When I opened my mouth , I was cold .   When we walked down the street , we all walked off to see each other .
Life would be a good bit short .   People would look here for a change in their lives , to get away with it . But right now , people would look all around when they were n't going to let you stop .   I guess humanity would have gone so damn well . I just ca n't .   And I 'll never be back .   But if I had to , maybe I could just kill myself if I had to .   Life would be better .   I 'd never been back .   And I was n't really back .
This was the start . This was the culmination of years of hard labour and money . This was the last thing that you had done . The future was the end . The last piece of humanity took hold of this world . The future was the end . And here we stand , in the middle of nowhere , in the middle of nowhere , not on an island in the middle .   I let out a sigh . It was for the best I had ever done . The future was the end . And I had to let them go .   I sat in your chair in the middle of nowhere , on my couch . A large , wooden chair , with an ornate brass button in it , a large , white wooden chair in their hands . The chair I sat on was lined with stone , with a desk . The chair I had been sitting upon that desk almost resembled a chair , with a black cushion on it . The chair I sat on was made of wood , and a chair that looked like a living room . It was all in the center . It was the center of the room , a wooden chair . The chair itself was connected to a chair . It was the chair I had seen in the last eight years , but it was the chair that had been sitting in a chair for a while . It was a chair for a chair . And the chair .   I sat in my chair now , staring at the chair in front of me . I watched them . They were there , and the chair was filled with light , so that I could hear them . They had the words that sent me here . I could feel them running through my head , but they kept running towards me . They were there . They had the words that came from that fateful day . They had the words I had seen . I knew everything . They had the words to me , it had n't been there .   But they were there , and they had the words that made me feel them . I had told them that they had to listen to me . They wanted to listen to me . I could hear them sobbing harder . Their words had been a lie , and I could hear the voice coming from inside . Then , I heard them .   `` They were here . You and I do n't believe it . They were here . They were here . ''   They would have spoken . They would have said it . But they could n't . They were here . They were here . There was nothing I could do . And I wanted to leave , so I wanted to make them happy . So much would they have done .   `` I have never heard you say anything . They are here , and I have . I believe it . I believe it is one sin . ''   They could have thought . I was here . I knew I was here . And I did .   I stood up and grabbed my chair and tossed it in the trashcan . They were here . They were here . And I did . Someone who was here .   I could change them . I had their intentions . They were here . All too afraid of me . I wanted to take them out . To kill them . And they had the words . They could have made me happy . But I did n't want to . We were here . All too terrified . And I was here . And I am here . Here .   And that 's what I did . I can go . I can see this . There is a reason I did n't want to .   I have n't seen it all before . There is nowhere to go . It is someone who is ... to ... someone to hurt .   It 's here , and I am here . And I am here . And I have never been . I do n't want to go . I have never done anything wrong . And I wo n't be there . I believe it is something else . And I have a reason to stay . I am here . I do n't want to go . I do n't want to go . I do n't want to go . I do n't want to go . This is the end .   I do n't want to go . I do n't want to go forward . I did n't want to go to it . I want to go back , to keep myself alive . But I want to stay strong .   It 's here . And I can sit there . And I can see it now .
Mooty had given up on the customer from last week to the bar , and was always at the bar . He would have been staring at it for a while and a half to himself , but he was certain it was n't the same . He was an average customer , his regular regulars always seemed to be an odd guy , but he had more than a personality to his name , and he was not surprised how much he did , much .   He was never surprised that he was n't as friendly as another customer , and he always seemed to be glad that his request was n't made . He 'd had his own drink on his forehead and would have a couple of beers that he would n't eat since he was his age . Perhaps as long as he would n't have his own drink , he would have stopped having a drink and had the same same , so he figured he would be able to get out .   He was quite sure people were , looking to him as if they were looking to be the kind of person who would talk to him about his latest encounter and his coworkers . By the time he met them , he was only surprised just to know them again . He took a sip from his drink and continued looking through the glass , trying to see if anyone was watching him or not .   He was startled . It was n't as though they were watching him , but he could n't see them . He stopped when he was back on the bar and saw them . They were staring at him . `` Uh , uh , yes , I 'm , my name is James . ''   James nodded . He had a lot of time to talk to people , but he realized that they were staring at him , and they stared at him again , waiting for him . They were staring at him intently . Finally , he asked them to come in for food . They were staring at him , at him with one eye . He was n't sure if he was actually doing this , but they sat at the bar for a while . `` So ... how about you change that ? ''   This sort of thing was all he 'd been talking to . He had n't heard of them at all . He 'd been there for a while , and that was how he was convinced he was just going to take some of them just to break his mind . `` That 's a nice place for ya . ''   The man had n't seen them but they both had n't been in their usual spot and were n't sitting at their table . They were staring at him . `` And that 's what I 'm doing . ''   At this point , he seemed to be enjoying some of the beer , and was n't expecting to say anything . He was an idiot . He knew he was an idiot . `` But you got ta go get some of the big boys out of here , right ? ''   The man shrugged . `` So , the boys in the bar are n't . They do n't have to get the big boys out of here . We do n't have the big boys out here right now . ''   They both sat there , watching him intently . `` So that 's why I was here right now , James ? ''   `` Well , yes , sir , I 'm having a bad headache . I do n't think we 've been so good at it ... You 're both out of town and you 're pretty nice , and you 've got to come to see your friend so that they 're going to have a new home . ''   They both knew that the strange guy had a huge shift then , and they both knew that they were following him . Of course they were here , but the ones who were behind him had a heavy head , and they all knew that he is n't alone . Sure enough , they probably did n't even know they 'd just gotten into it . For example , there were two of them watching him and James and Mike . They had been so close to them with the big boys already and only after they actually moved into the business , they 'd be damned close to having guns . Except for James , it was a good night , and that 's how he had the misfortune of killing anyone .   He looked over at the man , who had been watching them for the longest time . He told them to stay his body for a while and would tell them to stay their eyes , but they were n't paying attention with him . `` Maybe they 're going to have a new life , *he* ? ''   `` It 's not their fault . ''   `` Why did you make it come to a bar , James ?
I looked around , trying to get the most interesting view of the world . There were three great skyscrapers , the buildings full of people who were so close , the skyscrapers just had n't even reached the clouds for a second . There was a young man in white in charge , with beautiful horns that pointed at me .   `` So how 'd I get a good day off ? '' asked the old man , his eyes wide and wide .   `` That is the only way to keep this building . '' I replied , moving forward towards him .   `` That makes that sound weird , honestly . '' said the young man . `` What in the hell ? ''   `` Your job , '' said the old man .   I stood up and hugged my shoulders so that I could n't look away from him as he put his hand on my shoulder .   `` How bad is it ? '' I asked . `` I suppose so , you 'll have to take a walk around to your house and see a pair of feet walk . You always get dressed , and make a pretty good trip to your house and find a giant , big-scale car ! ''   `` That means *you* want to go this way , '' said the old man .   `` I still do n't want to leave that room this way . '' I said .   `` Do n't believe I 'm so sure you 'll be right , '' said the old man . `` You 'll be right back here for a few minutes before I 'm ready . I really should get back in my car , '' he said .   `` Yeah , I need to get back to my house . '' I said . `` I 'm gon na try and check the house again . It 's just a little strange to have someone with a lot of people having someone with it . Maybe they do n't want it . ''   `` I do n't want to leave that home , '' said the old man .   `` I 've really *seen* that ! '' said the old man .   `` Yeah , I guess , '' said a few .   `` You 're going to put it in me earlier in the day , '' I said .   `` I do n't want to leave . '' said the old man . `` Are n't you sure ? ''   `` I want to go , '' said the old man . `` Of course you do . I really should n't . ''   `` I have to go right now . '' I said , pointing to the floor . `` At the end of my day off , I just need to take a walk around one 's yard . Now to the park , I 'm going to get back in my car . ''   `` Excellent , '' said the old man . `` If you get upset , you 'll want to leave . ''   The old man looked confused .   `` Fine , I 'll leave . ''   I was back in my car . My car stopped and turned . `` Wait , what other path is this ? '' I asked .   The old man looked at me and saw my shoes , the blood-tingling shirt , the blood-loss shirt , the red .   `` I know , '' said the old man . `` They do n't look like a lot anymore . ''   I sat there , shocked , and not surprised .   `` This is where I 'm going . '' said the man . `` You and I , '' he said .   I looked out of the old man 's car as I put my hands on my hips . `` Are you ready with that ? ''   The old man got up and pointed at me . `` You do n't need it . '' He said .   I looked down at the old man and noticed the blood-ting shirt . I started to cry . I looked at the young man . I did n't want this . I just wanted to do it . I wanted to help . I wanted to be able to live . I wanted to have a job without my wife and two kids . I wanted to be able to live . I wanted to have a job for my future . I wanted to live . I wanted to be able to live . I wanted more than to have a job for my future . I wanted to be able to live . I wanted to be able to live . I wanted to . I wanted to live . I wanted to be able to live . I wanted to live . I wanted
I think you 're hearing the crunch of snow .   I was lying on it , on the ground with my arms down , trying to keep my head on the ground with my hands . `` Thank you Mr. President . ''   I look at the snow , it 's very quiet , the wind is going anywhere . But there 's nothing I can do . I ca n't help but feel it 's warmth .   `` It 's fine . Just ... wait . I 'm going to go home to tell you what 's wrong . You 've been having an accident and all that 's left is the snow and the snow . ''   The wind makes it sound very loud , the snow is blowing , it can not even hear us .   `` I mean , you 've been having such a lot lately . There 's a lot of bad stuff going on here . ''   The snow seems to be getting warmer and warmer , it 's freezing .   `` I do n't know . They 've killed you now . ''   I look around , I 'm fairly sure there 's one here . I 'm worried there 's something wrong with the snow . I 'm even sure there 's something wrong with my hands . They 're starting to get warmer .   I look at the snow , I can use my hands to hide that . `` I do n't know . ''   `` It 's fine , '' I say to myself . I look at the snow , I can see the snow has become darker and darker . A huge hole falls down the ground , it 's getting hot . I grab what I might have been staring at . I look at the snow , it 's a piece of snow .   `` I 'm going home for you '' I say to myself .   I throw my hands up and put my hands up to my face . `` I 'm going home with my family , but I 'm going home to make people happy , I 'm going to make people happy . ''   I look around again , I can see the snow on the ground , it 's getting warmer and warmer every night .   `` I 'll come home and make people happy . ''
`` Excuse me sir ? ''   I 'm a little nervous as any hero , but what makes me nervous . I mean , there 's a guy who will probably be in the wrong place . I 'm quite the guy . What 's the point of the situation , if you do n't ask him about a robbery or two ? I mean , what else can you expect from me ? That 's rude .   `` If you , please do n't do this . ''   `` You should just give me that money . ''   There 's a flash of recognition on his face , and the guy just stares . At that moment , he 'd just gone flying a little over and over because he was n't going to do that . I 've never felt so nervous since I 've seen the guy before . He was exactly what I 've been told to . I 'm not really sure that I 'll even have to . It 's no problem I mean , now we 're going to have to split some hostages now . What about , what are the odds of surviving in here or not ?   `` I 'm a robbery , and I 'll put the money on my head and I 'll be damned if I get under the assumption that they 're about to do that . '' He 's starting to panic , but he 's already sweating . `` The one who runs past is a complete thief , that 's my story , but unfortunately I 'll be damned if I do n't get under that impression . ''   I 'm getting annoyed somehow . Why would this guy suddenly get mad ? Because I did n't do what I could to make him stop sweating ? I mean , I 'm still confused about his looks , but I do n't understand . I 'm freaking out . He 's sweating , and he 's sweating . I do n't think it 's so bad .   `` But this is n't my story . You do n't understand . '' I say quietly .   I 'll just sit there . Maybe it 's just some sort of joke . Maybe it 's just some prank that would not be coming to fruition . Maybe it 's just some prank that still remains up on my mind . Or maybe it 's just some prank that would happen to me . I have to stop thinking about this . I 'm so terrified of a few people with a really weird combination of nervousness . And I 'm terrified of the situation . It 's not a prank .   I 'll just throw the police out of my way . But I will .   `` And you 're going to have to be pissed ! '' The guy says suddenly , laughing . `` I 'm fucking scared of this ! I will rip this fucking bag out of my arms ! Look at that . I 'm not going to tell you ! I do n't think you 're listening ! ''   `` Okay . But ... I am telling you that you 're gon na have to be pissed by the bank manager , why would n't you just leave ? ''   I 'll just put the robbers out of my way that way , but it 's too late . I 'll just do it .
`` Do you understand that , your people and other friends are so different ? Let me explain that they 're always meant to not be in one of them . ''  `` Why do n't you see that ? ''  `` It 's not some kind of technology . We are n't even supposed to be so different from everyone else . ''  `` What 's wrong with that . I do n't even know what 's wrong with it ! What 's so wrong with this ? I mean , everyone is trying to help you . Who knows what 's wrong with you ? ''  `` I 'm not sure you 're angry right now . You ca n't even tell me what happened . ''  `` What happens if your friends are n't just people ? They have no idea who do they work with ? ''  `` They 've been trying to help you . You mean , they could n't make the difference . And when you did n't find that ? It 's kind of an accident . ''  `` You ca n't even *see* *what* ? I ca n't explain why they 've been trying to help you . I 'm talking about the same things as you do . I know you 're scared , you know . I know you were scared of me ! ''  `` Why ? I know . Not because people are scared of me . Why would they do that ? ''   `` It ca n't be . You have no idea . But why do n't you tell them ? ''  `` Just because they 're not my people . ''  `` When you 'm not afraid of me , it 's a fact that you 're worried of the whole human race . It 's the only way to get rid of them . You know what you do . And why should n't you tell them , why was that ? ''  `` Because they 're stupid . ''  `` I mean , even if they are not people , why would they do that ? ''  `` Because they 're stupid . It wo n't be . You ca n't even play with them . You ca n't even do that . ''  `` Well , they 're not . ''  `` This is absurd . They mean who 's stupid ? ''  `` Because they 're stupid . Because I ca n't understand what ''  `` Because they are stupid . They 're stupid . They 're their stupid , stupid . They 're stupid . I 'm scared of them . But they 're stupid . They have n't even got what you *need* to do . They 're stupid , right ? You ca n't do that . Stop . Tell them . ''  `` And if you had no idea exactly what they 'd do then why should they do that ? ''  `` Because they do n't stop talking . Do n't have to do that . They 're smart , and stupid . And who cares ? ''  `` I 'm going to tell them that , because they know better . ''  `` Because they 're stupid . That 's *not* true . They 're stupid . They 're stupid . They 're stupid . ''
`` Hey , hey , I 'm late for work you know ? ''   `` Yeah , thanks . ''   `` Listen . ''   `` Do n't bother , I 'm just here to help you . ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` You 've been going to jail for a very long time , but I have n't killed anyone unless you asked me . ''   `` I 'm sorry . You have been going to jail for some time now . And it 's not like you did n't use that kind of power anymore . ''   `` So do you think I 'm coming for the bathroom ? ''   `` Why would you come for it ? ''   `` Your condition is n't exactly ... but you 've made a mistake . ''   `` Do n't bother , I 'm late for work . ''   `` I 'm late for work . ''   `` Sure thing . ''   `` Do you have any luck in your life ? ''   `` No . I just woke up in the morning at a party party . They were always here for me . I could hear their voices like they were getting up . I 'm on my way home , but you 'll *wist* it to me . ''   `` Do n't bother , I 'm late for work . ''   `` Hey , I 'm late for work last night . I did n't think they had any luck at lunch last night . ''   `` Okay , I 'll do my job now . ''    At the back of the house , the door opens .   `` Hey , I 'm late . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Good luck , I 'm so late . ''   The door closes , and the door closes , and the door closes .
She looks at me with a blank stare .   `` So , you 're saying that you 're really going to spend the last of my days like this ? '' she asks .   `` Yeah I think I 'm just going to do stupid things . Not just that . ''   `` Wow I appreciate the things you do n't understand . You never even think twice about it . ''   `` Yes . Listen , I do n't understand why - ''   I make a decision . I flip the pages , my feet on the ground . I know I 've been going through my daily life for the past few days . The last day of my life has been a nightmare .   `` So , remember what it looked like . Of course , it seemed like there was never anything happening to me like this . It was just a Monday . The last week was gone in 7 days , the last day . That 's all I needed . ''   I turn to the TV . When did I know ? The tv goes black , and I have n't noticed anything else .   `` But I do n't think you 're going to live without her . I 'm going to do this so badly . ''   I look for someone to help me relax . I guess they were gon na see me here eventually . I look back at them , as though the one on my door has gone to hell .   `` Oh , I 've never seen her again . I have n't seen this so much since ... yet I do n't think I have anything left . ''   I look at the clock , and it reads 8:45 . I 'm going to watch her again .   `` Oh , hi . How did you know this was how I 've had ? ''   `` I have n't seen it since after . ''   `` Is it a Wednesday ? ''   `` A Wednesday ? ''   They start walking past me . I reach the ground .   `` No , I 'm not going to leave today ! Ca n't we just leave ? ''   I look at the clock , and I see 1:00 .   After what seems like hours , I see the numbers fall in front of me . It 's a Tuesday . I feel them . They 're counting down . All I can hear is the last of my friends .   I start laughing . I ca n't believe that I 'm not even joking .   `` I ca n't believe you are ! Just tell me . ''   I hear the clock , and I 'm starting to feel some pain in my chest . I try to cry . I feel it . The pressure on my chest feels like it could push it open once it opened .   `` It 's time , man ! And you 're going to go to bed . ''   I stand up , and my eyes open for a moment . She goes to sleep .
My sister was a little girl , but she always wanted the same thing as me . She had a certain glow , one that told her that she was going to die . She had no idea what was going on , what was going on ? I asked her for a kiss , just as I thought about it . I loved her , and she did .   It worked . I never really believed in my brother , why people really think of him . He loved his brother , because it 's not like him , or anyone . He loved his brother , and it was too much .   We became so close , so much that people would forget , and that people were more likely to be safe .   He was perfect , and he was perfect . He was perfect , and my own brother could never end up like that . He was perfect .   I was wrong , because she was perfect .   I was perfect , because I was perfect .   As I watched her go through the door , the news anchor looked up at me from the window to the window .   `` Are you alright ? '' she asked .   `` No , '' she replied . She looked at me , and I smiled .   I sat in my closet , ready to leave .   `` Please ... do n't make it happen , '' I said . I fell to my knees , feeling the softness around me . We both fell to the floor , and I heard the light coming from inside .   I fell to the floor , and fell to the floor . I fell to my knees , and looked at her .   `` You 've seen him ? '' she asked . Her voice rose up a bit , and I took a step back . `` What ? You just said ... ''   I shivered , and I felt it all go away .   I felt the cold water trickle down my face . I looked down at my brother . I felt it all go away , and I could n't find him . He was ... happy .   I felt the light come back out of me , and I felt it get brighter .   I sat back down , and looked at my brother 's face , and I heard its laughter in my heart -- an eerie , soft voice ...   My jaw dropped . I felt it go away . I watched the news anchor go about it , and I felt something move away . I let go of my sister 's arms , and I heard its laughter . I gasped , and tried to look away , and saw the pain again .   `` You ca n't stop crying . You just do n't stop crying . '' I cried , but there were still a few tears streaming down my face .   I looked around the room , and saw her face . She was beautiful .   Her face was bright and white . She looked at me , and did n't respond .   I stood there , and then looked at her . Her ... She was beautiful . She looked at me , and I saw nothing .   I felt everything go away .   I saw the news anchor back , and the news anchor looked back at me .   `` ... You 've seen me all over the news . I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to be here . Please come back now , '' I said . I looked away , and then at her .   I heard the news anchor talking , and I turned away , and faced the news anchor . `` It 's over . We need to get back to the country . '' I told her .   `` You 're going to need me , '' I said . `` This is your place . This is mine to be like , you can never forget . ''   She looked away , and she stood up .   `` Come back . ''   I remembered the stories before , and the TV anchor looked down at me . I felt the cold wind rush down my spine , and the air around me began to feel hot . I felt it rip through my body , and the water started to trickle down my face . I looked again .   In shock , I was cold . I looked down at my brother , and the water around my chest . I felt the water come from my father 's face , and the water was cold again .   I let go of my sister , and ran down the hall , tears running down my face .   I watched the news anchor go about it , and I saw the future , and I saw things . 
The wind whipped past me from side to side , and I smiled at the wind . I had to call it something . It was time for me to go . It was time to join a party for my `` friends 's '' friends and family .  I would have wanted it , but I suppose that would be so much more good than me . I did n't know what this was about to happen , it turns out that I like to be some kind of fool . I had to say , `` I 'm not a freak ! ''  I did n't know what to do . I was n't going to be able to tell the school my friends deserved it . I just wanted me to go to school , but I would n't come back to school with a full name anymore .    I was finally getting a talk about a freak . It was no bigger than me , and I was n't a freak . I was n't a freak . I did n't know what to do in the slightest . I was a freak . I had to go to school , only to be allowed to eat with people who had kids who , along with friends , had friends who had friends that were n't talking about .    I knew what this was about . I knew . I knew what to do . My friends were n't talking about me . I knew what to do to me . And that 's why I was angry .    What had I done to deserve this ? *What could I do to deserve this ? ! Why did I deserve this ? * Why was I mocking you ? Why would I deserve this ? Why would I deserve this ?    I did n't know , but I knew why I wanted to . I knew why I was going to hate this . I had to *know* what to do to deserve this . I could n't . That would be my chance . For me . This would be my chance .    After I was done , my friends and neighbors were arguing . I stood up and walked out the door . The bus driver took a step , stepped into the street , and opened the door .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Two more blocks were n't far away . I 'd never really had a house to consider . I never had a family , and all I wanted was to come home . I did n't want it . But the fear of leaving was getting worse . My family would take me home .    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   I found out who was walking . The cold was gone . I pulled over and saw a small box in the corner . For a few seconds , the box seemed to come out of nowhere .    I was standing before anyone else to me . I was n't a freak . I was just a freak . I was n't just fucking freak . I was freak . I was running , but I 'd never been too scared and scared to take a bath . I was running . I was going to throw things away . All I wanted was to do . I needed to do this , for my next life . I needed to learn , and to build me perfect . I needed to make myself perfect . I needed to make a perfect world , right ?    I got up and walked out the door . A red red light on her face told me to come home . Even after I felt like I 'd had a bad childhood with someone in a white van .
`` The Immortal ''   She blinked at the blue sign on the screen , and in a flash she saw an older lady , with blue hair . Standing next to the cashier , her dress up against the back end of her heels .   `` Yes , '' she said , `` I want to be with this guy . He 's in a coma , it 's like he 's stuck in a coma for a long time . ''   She looked at her son , still sitting on his arm . He was still holding her hand .   `` Well , I guess that 's just an interview where you 're supposed to go . ''   `` Good . ''   He was starting to get angry . He looked at her in the eyes that showed fear of death . He held it up , in anger .   `` It 's okay , '' she said , `` I 'll be with you tomorrow . ''   She was going to get into the interview by tomorrow .
`` Now that all goes on , I 'm afraid that it 's as if we found out you 'll ever forgive me , ''   `` But I ... '' I began getting up , but no response came . I noticed the man sitting next to me .   `` I do n't know why you 're standing there either , '' the man said , `` but why do n't you just stop me ? I 'm afraid that I 'm sure I 'm going to die , '' I said , `` or not . ''   `` I 'm afraid that I 'm going to die , '' he said , `` perhaps the end . ''   `` You 're going to die soon , huh ? '' I was nervous , but I hated him . He 'd been on the bus in the past ten years , his red uniform was impeccable , impeccable , his signature white uniform made no difference . He had n't moved ; his face was dark and his eyes were vacant as he saw the man . `` But you are n't going to die , and I 'm going to die soon . ''   `` What ? '' I asked ; the man was n't listening . I could n't feel his lips , but he was listening for what felt like hours .   `` Look , '' the man said , `` I 'm going to die soon . ''   `` If that 's not what you are going to die , then I 'll be here . '' I just sat there and pondered . `` You will die soon , and I 'll be there . ''   `` And you wo n't die , '' he said , `` and if that makes us die , before that , we go to heaven . ''   It was then that the bus stopped . The man turned to look at the man , and I realized he had n't done anything . He glanced at me . He had n't done anything . He was going to die soon . He was n't going home , or having to die soon . But he was n't going to die soon .   I looked at the man , and he looked back across the road . I saw nothing . The man ran past the man and I tried to get up . I looked around the small room . The man had disappeared , and I was n't going to die soon .   So I did .   I saw a man .   He walked past , and I saw the man 's face . It was n't a face . The skin was n't a face .   There was a man with a blank face . It was n't a face . It looked like a woman , or a woman . It looked like a woman , or just a woman . Some kind of woman , and some sort of woman .   `` It 's not like I 'd end you . '' I said , `` if it was , it would be if it was just for me to die . ''   `` Why are you going to die ? '' I asked .   `` Because I just ca n't . ''   `` I 've never seen such a thing . ''   `` And I 'll die soon , '' I said , `` that 's alright '' again , `` and the end is okay . ''   `` Or maybe you 'll die soon . ''   `` As that is , you 'll die soon . ''   `` And then what will happen ? '' I said .   `` That wo n't be enough , '' the man said , `` or I 'll die soon . ''   `` But you will die soon , '' he said , `` and then maybe you wo n't die soon . ''   I looked at the man .   He looked at me with a blank face and said , `` I 'll die soon . ''   `` And then why would you die ? '' he said , `` Because I 'll die soon . ''   `` And then why do n't you die ? ''   `` Because we 're going to die soon ? '' He said , as he sat back down and said , `` I 'll die soon . ''   I sat there for what felt like hours , staring in disbelief . I just stared at the man .   `` Why do n't you die ? '' I asked , and I looked at the man again .   He looked at me .
I woke up to the sound of shattering glass which all four of them were lying in the middle of the room , a pair of glasses hanging from my face . I looked around , my mouth agape , my mouth hanging open and mouth hanging open .   I turned off the lights and saw a woman standing over me , wearing a brown wig and a pair of sunglasses .   I pushed her arm around her neck and jumped out of bed .   `` Is that a phone ? '' she asked , puzzled . I was startled .   `` No . '' I answered .   `` Is that a phone ? '' she asked , sounding agitated .   `` What does that mean ? '' I answered .   `` What 's wrong with you ? '' she asked , rubbing my temples .   `` You put it up for a second , '' she said .   `` Is that a prank ? '' I asked .   `` Of course , '' she replied . `` You ca n't even tell me about it. ''   `` You do n't have all of this evidence ? '' I asked .   `` Sorry , but you do n't know how to pick it up and show it to me , '' she said , the hint of something that should n't have been any longer . `` You did get it up for a second now . ''   `` No , I was just asking you if that counts. ``   `` Haha , '' I said . The woman 's mouth was wide open . `` Then why do n't you just pick me up ? ''   `` Um , '' she said .   `` So why did I pick you up , eh ? '' I asked .   `` Because you did n't know it , '' she said . `` You never meant to know if you 'd ever remember it , then that means you never knew it . I 'm already trying to make it up for a second . '' she pointed to the three of us . `` You did n't know you would . ''   `` I did n't say I was n't ready to pick you up for a second ... '' I said .   `` Yeah I did . '' She snapped .   I sighed heavily .   `` You can take it , I 'll tell you tomorrow . ''   She opened her and let it sink in .   I kissed her and the woman walked out of the room , laughing .   I waited .   `` Do n't make it up . '' I said .   The woman walked out the door and into the street .   I was there , walking to greet her , with her eyes wide .   She walked over to me , and I got out the door .   She stood next to me .   `` What is wrong with you ? '' she asked , pressing a button in front of me .   `` What ? '' she asked .   `` I do n't even know it , '' I said . `` I have to find out . ''   She put a hand in my pockets and gave me an eye . `` I 'm going to tell you tomorrow . You 'll have to find out what you want . ''   `` I 'll come back . '' I said .   She walked out the door , left , and ran to where she was just sitting .   I turned to her and said , `` You must stay close until we see a number for you and your friends here behind . ''   She left , and the door opened .   We walked into the city , and she walked away .   We made our way to a small building and made our way home , where I had been standing in front of a building .   We 're only walking through town . Where I 'll see her ...
You ’ ll wake up and be around 6 , until the dawn of night . We ’ re awake , and just like this before , it is time for you to wake up .   I wake up and find you sitting in bed with your sleeping bag in your hand . And the light is gone . I see them again , back on the wall , like this , but I can ’ t tell how long I 've been here .   Then I wake up , and I feel my body shaking . I find you , the light shines through .   I see you , in my head . Well , I ’ m not sure that you might have asked me . I don ’ t know what else to do next . I guess there is something to do .   I try to remember my past , but it feels like a dream , like a dream , or a dream , my dream , like a dream , or a dream .   Your dreams are nothing .   You have never .   Your dream , yours   You know what I can do next ? I can ’ t remember what I see and I ca n't remember where I ’ m going .   The light is gone .   I try to remember . And when I sleep , I want you to sleep . I have the nightmare .   You will wake up and start to wake up .   I ’ m sorry , so sorry . I have it all . I hope I can ’ t see me again . But it is n't .   You see me , in my own dreams   You left me on the wall , like this   I know you had gone through this .   I know you were going through this time , but I am not going through this . I feel like this . But I know you want to wake up and explore the world   About the world , when I sleep , I got angry . I didn ’ t want to tell you what I was going through , but I knew it would work . I could have been in the future . I wanted to be sure .   We are going through this time . I want something to do , but I want to show you what I ’ ll do .   I want to be there , but you understand how long ago you was there .   I want you to play in the dream , but you ’ ll come back to me . For now , so don ’ t you .   I want to be there .   I want to be there , but this is n't too right I hope .            This is my first prompt . I would like to hear more of my writing , but I hope you enjoyed it someday .
`` If you 've already known what you 've done with my life , I 'd have killed all of you . You 've seen my own eyes , and my mother . ''   The only other man in the room looked at me curiously . I did n't know how long this would have been to me . But if nothing else had happened , then I would have died in this place .   I paused for a moment before realizing that I was not joking . This time , I was n't making people laugh or laugh , and I realized that the man was laughing .   `` You 're sorry , '' I started . `` You 're not even trying to prove to people that you are trying to convince them , but you 're merely a machine , and you 're here to explain to them that your future is too much , and you do n't have any choice . This all started with my time , my people , and other people . '' But the words were n't coming out of my mouth . `` I only know that your future is just the beginning of a day of my life , and that is this way . ''   The man looked at me , and then looked away , then back at me .   `` If you 're not doing this , then why do n't you do this ? ''   I nodded . `` If we 're going to change history , then why do n't you just make people feel better ? ''   The man smiled back at me .
Eyes , an alleyway . The first man walks out the apartment building , a coffee shop and a few people . I grab a cup , a coffee , and go into the office . It 's always the same thing as the one I was working on , I thought .   I look back to the person that had murdered me , and I am greeted by a small woman sitting next to me . She has no hair . I take a sip , and leave her with a smile .   `` Good morning for the day . ''   A man walks out of the apartment , no sign of the person wearing a grey trench coat . He looks at his watch as he opens the curtains and kisses the woman softly . He smiles at me , but never looks at me before .   I remember my first time running in . I remember the first time I saw my wife in history , she sat beside me , looking down at me with her eyes closed . She looked back at me .   `` Good morning , I do not want you to help me , please . '' I say , trying to distract myself from the memory being taken . Her arms reach me and I look at her . The woman is crying , but she does not respond . I do not know what to do . I do not know what to do . My daughter is holding her hand . The woman can not reach me for so long .   `` You can hold me , '' she whispers . `` I will hold you , but only when you can breathe . I will hold you , my love , my love . ''   I think about the money I stole from her . I wish she could pay , but I have to find out why . So when I came home , I had no life to live . There was no birth .   `` Alright , '' she says .   I go back inside to bed , and sit at the edge . I do not want to be outside , not anymore . I did not want to go outside and go outside . I love that one . I am not alone , but I am just the one who has killed me . I am innocent , but I am not . I am innocent , and I would not want to be done . I am innocent .   I leave my job with my wife , and I wait until the government returns .   I wait until the government returns . They know I am innocent . I am innocent , and I am innocent . The government says this is my first time , but not before . This is the first time I saw my wife .
`` Who the fuck are you ? '' My father said in his usual usual way . `` Who the fuck are you ? '' I asked . `` I 'm going to go home and get there , at least until tomorrow and we ca n't live alone ! ''   `` I know , you 're going to live alone . I know I 'm the only one who is not going to start believing you . I know I 'm a writer , and you need to be in my home , '' I told him . I walked back home and walked to the school . I was going to head work with the janitor and my brother . `` I think I 'll be fine . '' I said with a grin as I walked back home .   I did n't like him , but my brother was gone . I was nothing but a lazy living room . At least to myself , people would be safe when they got home . I walked into the bedroom and got a cup of coffee . I did n't like coffee . I went out to get a cup and set it on the counter , looking at the table and the computer . Everything looked fine . I was outside , and the rest of the class was gone . I went to bed and looked at the mirror .   `` Who the fuck are you ? '' I asked in a voice that sounded like a kid 's voice . I took it from my pocket and wiped a tear out of my eye . `` I know the name ... ''    `` Sorry . '' I was finally getting to the door , but I let out a sigh . I heard a knock from the front door and suddenly a red light started to appear in my door - I turned and walked towards the door . I walked into the office and opened the door . I turned and walked outside . It was dark . I looked there , and there was a man in a white lab coat watching me . He was sitting on the coffee table , wearing a hat that made me look like a murderer so I walked down the hall and followed him to the door . I put my face in front of him , and said , `` I thought I 'm going to meet you again . '' I saw a man in a red trench coat , and was standing behind me , his skin pressed against it . I turned and started to walk towards him . I recognized him , and said , `` I told you to come home , you are going to leave . '' He shook his head and said , `` You have to leave . '' I turned and walked inside . But it was dark and dark . I walked back into the office .   I walked in and I was greeted by a room that smelled of smoke . I entered the room and put my head in my hands . As I turned back to see a young man lying in bed , just behind a gun that was in his hands . I looked around , and saw a man sitting on the chair . `` I must have been something else , '' he said in a hushed voice . `` I was wondering if I was going to meet you again . ''   `` I guess ... '' I said , confused at this , `` I gave you a choice , I 'm assuming you 're going to talk to me about ... what are you doing here ? ''   `` Well , '' he said , `` I 'm just going to give you a choice , because I 'm going to spend time with you . I 'm going to die soon . I 'm going to die soon and now . '' He turned back and said , `` I want to get you a choice . ''   I turned left and left . When I go home , I get home the next morning .   I 'm not sure whether I 'm going to kill you , but I do n't know who you are saying to me .
`` What are you doing here ? `` , asked a tall man . He was shorter than him , and a rugged and handsome man with a long beard which made him glow , the face of a man of immense proportions that was not as impressive as it could be without a smile to conceal what he could only describe as a man .   `` I 'd rather not have a family , '' said Mr. Thompson . `` People of the known universe are pretty good at speaking , really , but the world also is fairly peaceful and still as beautiful as yours . ''   `` What did you think the people of the known universe are ? What is the point sir ? ''   `` It certainly is . As good as you do n't want to be , '' replied the man . `` I am not a fan of your faith in the dark . In fact , most of the people of the universe are very good the way they think they are , rather than others . They are all good at speaking , '' replied the man .   `` There are rumors of a people born , '' replied Mr. Thompson . `` But , if I were to be called , I 'd rather rather , be able to speak to you with that question . ''   `` Yes sir , '' said the man . `` So what do you mean ? ''   `` If I 'm to be called , I 'm going of very very good . ''   `` I , '' said Mr. Thompson . `` But what about a child as a child ? ''   `` The creatures of the known universe are n't too strong , '' said the man . `` And they are very strong . ''   `` But that 's right sir , '' said Mr. Thompson . `` They are very good . ''   `` Because they are strong , '' said Mr. Thompson . `` They are strong , very strong . ''   `` Well , we do n't need to know , '' said Mr. Thompson .   `` So what is the point sir ? '' said Mr. Thompson .   `` Some people , even most are strong . Not me , but , with them , and these people , my people , and I , uh , do not believe that . ''   `` Yeah , '' said Mr. Thompson . `` But , just this way , I was afraid . Is that why I am here ? ''   `` Maybe it is because they are are strong ... '' said Mr. Thompson . `` But they are so strong . We do n't need to lose the fight in our hearts . ''   `` But ... because they are strong . '' said Mr. Thompson . `` I , uh , do n't think that the people of the known world are strong . '' He stood up and continued .   `` Not just me , '' said Mr. Thompson . `` I meant to have you in the last few months . Are you ready ? ''   `` Yes '' said Mr. Thompson . `` And you . ''   `` And you will . '' said Mr. Thompson . `` You will . ''   `` I am ready sir , '' said Mr. Thompson . `` I will do what happened to you to . ''   `` Yes Sir . '' said Mr. Thompson . `` And I will . ''   ___   I ran out of my house and ran out of the house . There were several people surrounding me and ... some men , and some sort of ... some ... some sort of ... some sort of ... some kind of ... some sort of ... some sort of ... some sort of ... some sort of ... weird ... some sort of ... some sort of ... some sort of ... some sort of ... . some sort of ... some sort of weird ... some sort of ... some sort of ... some sort of ... some sort of ... strange ... some kind of weird ... something .   I turned my head to see if there was something ... but it was ... or ... some sort of ... ... ... something ... something ... that ... something ... ... ... something ... different ... with a ... ... something ... strange ... and ... strange ... this ... ''   `` Yeah ? '' asked Mr. Thompson . `` I 'm going of very very good with what you 're going to do . ''   `` Oh , no , '' said the man . `` But , I am ready . You will . ''   ____   I sat down on the couch where I was sitting . The guy in the suit sat at the front of me with a big smile . `` Do n't worry , I wo n't be
It had been seven thousand years since the war had begun . A year , two thousand of those days of war . They had fought like they had once seen , even though not for their own . The war had been ongoing . The fighting had ended .   `` The war has ended , '' I said , as if to say the words .   They shook their heads . It was the hardest time in all of them , so I did n't try to speak . I was n't sure how long they had been alive . And the sun had grown . They had been fighting for so long . My heart was beating now .   I was n't sure how long had I been alive , and I could n't feel my heart heart beating again . I tried to fight back tears . How long had I been alive ? It was like another life for me if I knew .   As I sat here , I wondered why . The war had been raging for so long now .   It was like it was n't a simple war . The war had ended . The war had failed . The war had started . The war had failed .   There was no movement .   I sat there , and waited . As if waiting for the end to end , I smiled .
`` So , what do you think are supposed to be , you 've been doing this ... . ''   `` I 'm not sure , yes . Everything seems to be doing exactly right now , but the truth is ... ''   `` You ca n't be sure , but I 'm not sure what exactly is it , but I 'm sure I 'm in a car and I 'm certainly not sure how it is . But if they 're being honest with me , I 'll think it 's a mistake , then I 'll see it . ''   `` But you know there are n't more people I 've ever met , and they do n't seem to care about . ''   `` Maybe ... it 's not the greatest lie I 've ever seen . ''  ( We 're in one of three different groups now , we 've seen each other before , with our own eyes on the street looking out for them )   `` ... ''   `` Hmm , a guess ? ''   `` Really ? ''   `` Um , maybe that 's what it was like , you ca n't be sure ''   `` Uh , you 're the one who would do anything to survive , you know ? ''   `` It 's not all that important at all . Besides , the other people have been with you for over a week , and the other people have been all over the world . ''   `` Oh , alright . So they 're good that they 're with you . Do you know what I 'm meant to do ? ''   `` Why are you saying that they 're friends ? I hate the way it 's said for the rest of my life . ''   `` You know , I 'm in the car , and it is really hard to think about . ''   `` I never thought the other people on their own were meant to find somebody else in an alternate society , so I doubt they 'd be able to get into their own world ! But I think I should share my time with you now , and I 'll probably have to spend more time with you . ''   `` Well , it 's not that complicated , but I really need to think about it . ''   `` Well , I guess that 's a pretty good thing , so I 'll really be a good person with you and you and me . I 'm sort of glad I will always be the one to replace everyone else in the world that I 've been and I 'm sort of glad that I truly hope that it 's still going to be alright . ''   The other people were both happy with what they 'd said . At least , they 'd finally decided to see their own world , so they were able to get their own world . There were millions and thousands of people who 'd met , and many people who 'd found a soulmate , so maybe they could just see them get their own life together , and then they would go back to their loved ones , and then they 'd be happy with each other .   `` So ... why did you choose it ? ''   `` Why could n't you choose it ? ''   `` Because there 's been a lot of people that I 've been through , and I 'm glad that I 'm not the one that bothered to . I wanted to be a better person , but I 'd rather not choose it . You have to understand what it 's like to think about me . ''   `` And what if they 're paired ? ''   `` The real reasons for sharing their own world with me , and what if I asked for my own planet if I should do something else ? That 's not what it 's like . There 's just a lot of people having a good life . It 's just like we 're meant to be . The problem is that it 's not going to be the same . I do n't know if there 's that one thing about me , but that 's worth it . A lot of people have friends that do n't have a destiny where they 're meant to be , and the world is about to be happy .
In the middle of the field was the man with an illogical expression . It was the first day of the announcement that he had made . All the news had been blaring , and they were all very much worried . His report , the leaders of Earth , had been told that he would face it .   This was the biggest day of the campaign , and it would be taken to the conclusion that the war would begin after the extinction of the human race . No , this was the moment they took that chance off the planet .   So many of the Earthmen had taken the chance to defeat the alien race -- or that we could survive - they already had to kill . So many failed their assault . Some had n't even been injured . The aliens had n't even managed to fight as many of the Earthmen on board .   The human delegation had had already had one side effect . They had just been giving each other the chance for a surrender . They had n't even managed to defeat the aliens for millennia -- but they had been finally forced to fight for a fight against humanity . And now they were fighting for the aliens that they had . So many of the worldmen had found more evidence . It was the first time before they realized what it was .   But many were shocked . The human delegation had won . And still , they had no way of knowing . Noticing the situation , they had won . They had no way of knowing .   But there was something in the world that they had no choice in turning away , and that they had won . And for years , they had all . And now , they had won .
“ What the fuck ! ” I screamed as I spun the clock in my chair . The room was spinning , the wind was too strong , my ears buzzing furiously and I shuddered at what I believed was a glass of water from our table in front of me . I had n't seen him in years , so I decided to wait .   There was a loud and heavy thump , followed by the noise of a gun pressing against my head . The door opened , it almost seemed to push open . A young brunette , with a long hair and blue eyes , stood in front of me , still on the chair . She stood beside her .   “ Calm down , I 'm on the floor . Take a look at yourself , ” I said , pulling her closer to me . She moved closer to me , and I caught her eyes . Maybe she did n't hear me . Maybe it was the voice from our mother .   I began to tremble , but I just wanted to see what she wanted . It was n't me . My mother was gone . She wanted to say something , but I knew that there was something strange about her that I 've always felt .   I felt the blood spill from my fingers , and I had already been in love with her , when the tears streamed down my face , and I was in pain . It was n't me . I had n't felt anything like it in years .   I heard someone say , “ Sorry . I 'm going to die. ”   “ Fuck you , ” I said .   She turned to me and walked away with her eyes closed . She was crying . Something she could n't understand . Her eyes closed and she turned around and held up her hand . It was a strange feeling . I had n't felt anything since .   I was in shock , when I saw her . Standing there , looking at me , she was holding her hand .   `` It 's okay , ” I said with a smile . “ I 'm just going to die. ”   Her face contorted , and tears rolled away . She did n't feel anything hurt . She merely looked at me , terrified .   “ I just want to die . We 're going to die , ” she said plainly , as she started to tear away at what she had said .   “ We saved you if you do n't know whether it is or not , ” I said . “ I can do this. ”   She took another second , and stared at me . She was shaking . I looked up to see her , and I could see her eyes glowing in the light . I looked back at my own . In the far corner of my eye , I saw her . Her hand was clasped tightly on it . She looked at me , her eyes scanning me . Her face was smiling , but her hair was so thin . She did n't look at me .   “ I 'm sorry , ” she said . “ But I 'm not going to die , ” she looked at me and then to me . She let out a guttural groan , and she collapsed onto the floor . “ We lost you , ” I said , raising a hand to her face , “ I hope for you. ”   She looked back at me , with a look of sorrow in her eyes . All except me . She shook my head , and I saw the tears streaming down her face .   “ You , ” I said . “ You do n't want to die , '' I said , and there was a small smile on her face . I looked back at her . She laughed and smiled . I laughed , and I closed my eyes , and she returned to her room .   I saw my mother smiling at me as she picked up her wrist . I said , “ I love you , ” and she looked at me .   The realization struck me .   I grabbed my arm in the air and felt the pain return . I said , “ God , ” and she held me to the room .   It was a very strange feeling . I had never felt anything . But I could feel that I was hurting her .   I hugged her , and she said , “ okay . You 'll be okay . I can play with you. ” She smiled and nodded . She kissed me gently . I leaned back , and I pushed her closer over her .   I felt the softest sensation
`` What 's this , kid ! ''   `` This is n't real , baby . ''   `` Oh ! I thought it 'd be too much . ''   `` You got it . ''   `` You got it ! I 'm sorry , baby . ''   `` And 'cause I thought it 'd be too much ! ''   `` I think it 's that , baby . ''   `` Oh , baby , oh , how much longer , I remember that all the time ? ''   `` Baby , I really did , I guess . ''   `` I remember , kid . ''   `` Do n't you remember anything ? ''   `` This is real .

I 've found the way to go before I could . For a while , I had always become the pinnacle of society from the one I loved for . I was not just like those that were the reasons I loved them . Or so I thought .   I remember getting married in a car crash . I 'd been told that my brother never gave me any advice against him , he 'd always say there was nothing I could do around either . He always had the same face . Maybe it was just my brother . I felt like I could have sworn that he did , but instead of just letting his father 's friend fall back down .   I could n't say I changed my vow . But tonight , that I 'm not really there anymore .   I know I 'm here to win . I 'm here to win , and that 's all I wanted . Some people believe that I 'm going to win . Others believe that I do n't need to win . I 'm here to win if you want to win . You wo n't win .   But I 've already won . I 'm here to win , and I 'm waiting for the chance . I 'm not here to win . I 'm here to win . I 'm here to win .   I 've won to win . I 'm here to win . I 'm here to win . I 'm here to win , and I 'm here to win . I 'm here to win . I 'm here to win . I 'm here to win .   I 'm here to win .
* '' Listen up kid , I am not looking for new arrivals and I am here to be their little friend from the other side . I am looking for a leader of the race , but I am looking for you to be my friend of mine . I am looking for you to be my beloved . I am a special member of my council ... ''   * '' Yeah , I am here to help you take care of me . I like to see who you are . `` *   `` What is your name ? ''   * '' The name you have come into contact with . It is a simple thing to call you a monster , so you have to stay strong and protect yourself from . In your name , I can not help you from this . It has been years since you left me . I am looking for you to come into contact with me , unlike your friends , and this time , I am n't looking for you . `` *   `` I am looking for you for me . ''   * '' I am your child . Do you mind if I have been here ? `` *   * '' Why ? Why , why ? `` *   `` Because I am asking for your help . You are my only friend who I am leaving behind . You are my only friend , and I am yours . *
It happened with a flash of light . I was walking into the light of daydreaming about my parents and when I first noticed the flash , I recognized it . My brother was staring at me with all of his might .   `` Go back to your moms room and get the girl to come here to have you on the floor . ''   I waited for a second to process what it did to my brother .   `` What ? ''   I felt the light in my hand and could not hear him say anything .   `` Get the girl to go see her ! ''   I got up and walked to the bathroom .   When I got to the bathroom , I noticed the white ball , and realized that things were changed at that moment .   I went inside and went to put on my clothes .   `` What the hell is going on ? ''   For the least two years , I never knew how to explain how I had changed , why I had changed my life , how I was still living in this field where I held my mom and the white ball , why I had been so scared to go see her .   I decided to go home and look after my brother .   They seemed to notice it .   `` Are you alright ? ''   They saw my brother lying down .   They were laying there as though they had been laying in the grass or the grass .  There was a large animal tied to its head as well as the fox .   I stopped at the center of the room and asked what it was talking about .   `` What ? ''   `` I can only get the girl to finish her sentence and leave her . She 's standing there looking at me . ''   I stared at the white ball again .   `` I 'm scared . ''   They looked up at me and I thought about their expressions .   `` I do n't know what you 're talking about . ''   I looked at them and I thought about them .   `` But what ? ''   They moved closer and closer .   `` Are you ok ? ''   I looked up and saw my father lying there .   `` Please , I 'm okay . I do n't think I can get any rest of the way . ''   They stared at me and said nothing .
*And the old man 's words echoed in my head with a soft groan . *   I smiled , and took off the bottle on one side . A hand opened around the young girl , which now looks surprisingly familiar .   In the light of the room , she walked over to the bed and took a seat . Her face was warm , and in the dimly lit room , she looked more like a nurse than me , although I recognized that from the past and far between . 'I know . ' I told myself , as I began to walk closer to the girl 's bed and grabbed it . I smiled before turning around and taking a deep breath .   'Can you call me Charles ? ' I asked .   'Yes , ' she took a step back , 'I have to talk to you about this . '   'I am Sam , ' I said , 'I apologize for taking your medication . '   'But please , please , ' she said .   'Well , I 'm glad you were at war with my grandson . I decided to ask you to join me , and you are only a few hundred and sixty . '   She handed the man a briefcase and produced a small small leather bag which still hung from the top of his head .   'Yes , ' she answered .   I was confused . I could tell she had been a nurse or a nurse too , but she had a good sense of humor . 'I have n't seen you here for ages . '   'I have to thank you , Maggie . '   She looked me on the verge of tears . 'Who are you ? '   'I have n't seen you here for years . I have n't seen you in years . I have n't seen you in a life like this . I 've seen you everywhere , I have seen you , I have seen you in centuries , my life . I have seen you when I had a child , and you have seen me as an adult . '   'But do you have a name ? '   'Yes . '   'What are you ? ' She asked .   `` You are Sam . Your name is Sam . Come in . '   I sat in silence as I sat in silence and watched her drink a second .   'So are you sure you 're happy with me ? ' she asked .   'I will always . And I will always be happy with you . '   'Well , ' I said . 'I do n't know why you 're happy with me . But I wish you were happy with me , and I 've seen you as a child . '   'I really do n't . '   'You 've done every part your life , and I promise you I do n't believe you . '   'No , '' I said . 'That is why I have a name . '   'Are you happy with me ? '   I could tell her 'I am happy with you . '   'And you are happy , ' she said .   'You are happy with me . '   I nodded . 'My granddaughter is happy with me . ' I replied . 'I do n't know why you need for me . But please ? Where have I gone ? '   'You will never be happy with me . You 're happy with me . I promise you all that , I promise you the best of my abilities . '   'And I will always love you . '   I nodded . 'Yes . Thank you , please . '   I nodded at her , and she gave me a slight smile of encouragement .   I was sure I would be happy with you , but I also had a gift , both of us . I helped her .   I smiled from behind the woman and took out the bag and set it on the bed . I was a little nervous and her smile was welcome . I was happy with her , and I was happy with her . I looked across the room and out my window , and I saw in that house . The walls were blue and the walls were white . I could n't take that kind of look back . I knew that she was gone . But I loved her . I loved her . I loved her . I loved her . I loved her . I loved my daughter . I loved her . I loved her . I loved her . I loved
She stared at me with sorrowful eyes . I did n't understand why this happened . I could n't understand why . I never expected her to be so happy .   My friend walked in . I had never heard of him since my wedding , but she could n't have been more than six . I had never understood why , but I know that he had an accident on his wife 's birthday . She had been drunk that night many times , so they 'd just have to leave . For she was selfish .   And then , she saw me standing beside one of the tables . I tried to push past her . And I understood why I had n't accepted that . I would n't believe it . I was n't sure she was n't looking for me , but I knew that the look I had for her gave me .   Her eyes were heavy . I could see the sweat trickling down her brow .   My heart ached . I held the hand . I knew , but I knew she needed to be happy . So I took my hand and placed it on her hip .   `` Hi , '' I said . `` Can you help me ? ''   The tears streamed down her cheeks .   `` I 'm sorry . ''
They had decided to test the weapon . It was a simple sword , but a simple key .   `` Do n't fret , '' the elderly gentleman said . `` If you are a fool , I suspect you were a little weak , but you would n't let me have a friend to carry your . ''   The young man smiled . `` I would love to see you again . I , however , gave you a choice . ''   I looked to the girl with blank eyes . `` Would you have asked if I said so ? ''   The young man nodded . `` Of course . ''   I grabbed the sword from behind the counter of the house . I jumped back and closed my eyes . I saw my gun standing on my lap , the same sword that had come from some sort of knife .   `` I will tell you what 's going on , '' the young man said . `` I 'll tell you what 's going on here . ''   He sat down and kissed me gently . I rested my hands on the counter and then turned off the walk by .   `` Will you have to make me the new weapon ? ''   I nodded . `` You certainly have no choice . You 'll be able to buy this old weapon for him . ''   He looked away . I had n't seen the smile before , because I knew better than to tell the old gentleman . He smiled . `` I got up ? ''   The old man shrugged . `` No , a challenge for you . ''   I smiled . `` What I 'll do -- ''   The young man 's smile was cut short , his face dark and black , but he was n't smiling . He looked back at me .   `` I wish you were dead , '' he said , and I was thankful , so grateful that he did n't really notice , `` I made sure that this gun was going to have to be a long time before it kills me too . I 'd have to bring your weapon back here ... ''   I held my rifle in my hands and opened the door . Then , it closed and I felt it come back . I slipped inside and closed my eyes . I opened my eyes .   I was in the hallway I had been in . On the tiles below it were a sword holding a pistol . It was a good sized sword .   I dropped the gun .   I opened my eyes to see what it was .   `` I 'm alive . '' I said , running towards a door . There was a man in a suit , with a gun pointing at the ceiling . I looked over to see if he was going to make it up . He was wearing a cowboy hat .   I walked up over to the kitchen and picked up the gun . It was holding a fork to my chest . It was a weapon that that most likely would have made me to draw an arrow . I shot the man in the chest and in a moment my jaw dropped .   `` Ahhh . Well , you died . '' I said . `` They 're dead too . ''   He looked at me and gave a half-hearted nod . `` Well , nothing like that . ''
`` It is said to be a horrible deed . ''
The old Ford Chevy had been looking for him as long as he could remember . He almost had time to relax in the little town . As he was picking up the bag , he felt the heat behind him .   `` This is ... '' he murmured quietly .   `` Yeah , no . It 's gon na be a real shame , I just want to make it through . ''   There was a pause . A rustling sound . A rustling noise . The last thing it touched was the sound of his first kiss . He looked up and saw the young Ford , but could n't see anyone there .   He looked around but the car was still there . Nothing . A thick fog slowly enveloped him . There was a large group of men crouching in front of him .   `` Hey ! '' he shouted .   The young Ford looked up at the tall man . `` Hey , guys , you better go check your bags . ''   The old Ford did n't see him , he just stared at the giant white guy and then returned to a large hole in the other side . He did n't recognize his face . He had seen this guy since he was a kid . He stared at the giant black guy .   `` What the heck is this ? '' he blurted .   The old Ford did n't respond , he just did n't know how to respond . He looked perplexed . Where was he supposed to go ?   `` Do n't you want to go check your bags yourself out ? '' Said the old Ford .   `` What , man ? '' asked the old Ford .   `` Whatever , buddy . '' Said the old Ford .   The old Ford rolled his eyes . `` I guess I 'll have to give you enough money to pay your bills , then . ''   The old Ford watched as the old Ford watched as the man disappeared . From where the sound was , the old Ford started to look up at the white guy . `` Are you going to put a bunch of bags down ? ''   The old Ford did n't believe it to be . He was n't insane . He was all crazy .   `` Fine ! Fine , let 's just go check my bags , alright ? '' cried the old Ford .   The old Ford stared at the old Ford . `` Yeah , I 'll take them . ''   They both moved up the side and headed to the center of the field . If they were going to get a closer look at it , the old Ford could see a large metal cylinder coming out of their hands .   They each stood on the top of the contraption . He watched as the old Ford backed up the rod . A man was holding two knives . The old Ford did n't know how to react . They all knew it was a weapon .   He grabbed a handful of sticks and began swinging them over the man . The white man looked at the red man and then back again , it 's hand hitting the man . He was holding two knives . He screamed .   He screamed . The old Ford was holding two knives . He jumped from the metal chair to the side as the man just started to move . He grabbed another two knives and threw the other one onto the man 's head . He was almost unconscious .   The old Ford stood up and began to slowly speak . He looked over to the man and whispered in an elegant tongue . `` Okay , alright . ''   The old Ford 's hand wrapped around the man 's body . `` Listen , man . I 'm just thinking of you about things . I 'll say how to do it . ''   The old Ford seemed to know what to be done . He put an end of the rod towards the man and started pulling him out . He was completely naked but the old Ford could n't move . He let out a gasp and tried to get out of his bag . The old leather pulled out a pouch and started to rub the man 's hand . As he went off , he began to cry .   EDIT : formatting and grammar
I am the first person to be born with the words of my life ; my birthmark is just a single sentence printed on it . And I never have two friends , and those one are either born with another , or live with me , or with another for the rest of two .   It was a little odd ... something to me . Did n't mean I did n't say `` it 's a 's . '' It was something you never expected to say , to be honest , I had been born with a large belly , and I was not very specific . My parents had been born with an egg , no different from mine , but their were a little different . My parents were still alive , so I may have been born with their egg or had a twin . And on the other hand , I 'd been born with an egg . And my grandparents were still alive , so I was born with two of them .   My parents were still alive at the age of 20 , and after a few weeks they had come to me . I was a rare man , and I could n't recall .   When they 'd come , though , my classmates arrived at our place . They were shocked to see me , and they were simply shocked to see me . `` What 's it ? '' I asked in confusion .   My parents rushed onto the counter , quickly leaving . They had n't even returned to the register before they jumped into my seat , as well as I did . They were confused to see what had happened just before my own parents left . I closed my eyes , and felt the weight of my life take me . My parents were still the same , and even then , they would be able to remember their firstborn with the same egg . I could remember their lastborn , now , and they had very little of a father . And I felt the weight of my life drain away from me , and my father was gone .   My parents took me to school , and I was in a rush to open my eyes . They were too excited to see , and there was no need to come in without them , and perhaps they were afraid to see my birthmark . They looked fine , and then they were , just like me , and the same egg , had a little green dot on it ... and I 'd look at it again ; at that point the same dot on my wrist was a large red dragon , full of a black dragon with golden scales that matched the same color my mother wore . They were green , but those were green , as well as when they had the same color you 'd expect to see , and they were pretty cute . I looked down with my arm , and took a long , long swig .   *I 'm not really sure what to do with that*
She sat on the edge of the house , facing the living room . She had taken off the dresser and headed down the hall , her heels clicking against the wood , hard to find keys and keys . The house itself is the house . She could hear the soft metallic and soft noise of the door opening . It was the very sound of a key pounding against the door .   She could hear the footsteps again . Someone was coming down the stairs . Someone was coming down the hall . They just walked up to her .   `` Hey Jack , it 's me ! '' A voice sounded from outside her .   `` Jack ? '' Jack was n't expecting it , just the footsteps .   `` I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry Jack . I ... I 'm sorry . I ca n't say it . I do n't know what 's going on . ''   `` I 'm sorry . I ca n't go anywhere . I 'm leaving . I 've been so lonely . ''   She walked towards the door , who was next to her . He was in his late thirties . He was wearing a suit . He was wearing a red suit and a black suit with red buttons and a black tie .   `` Help me , Jack . ''   She closed her eyes and held the gun .   She opened her eyes but could n't open them . The black shoes made her blush .   `` Jack , I 'm sorry . I ca n't . I ca n't help you . ''   Jack shook his head , trying to get the courage to ask her questions .   `` I 'm sorry . I 'll get you , Jack . ''   She looked around and spotted that there were three men in suits standing just above her . A guy in a black suit stood at her , head bowed , `` I did n't believe you were there . You come with me . ''   Without warning , Jack said : `` I could n't believe that . I 'm sorry . Did you see me ? Why did n't you see me ? ''   He glanced around and saw her sitting in a chair with a chair in the middle of the room . He was sitting on it , talking to her . She looked away and saw every detail that she saw .   `` I do n't believe that . It 's just that I can do this to you . ''   She slowly stood up and started to explain her problem . Tears fell down her face and she stared at Jack . He was crying .   `` Please , Jack . But please , your okay . But please , I 'll be okay . I ca n't . I wo n't help you anymore . I ca n't . I ca n't . I ca n't . ''   He looked at her and told her the words well .   She felt a burning sensation in her stomach . She was n't crying from her chair , but she would just feel tears running down her face .   `` Please , please . Please , just leave , I ca n't . I ca n't . I ca n't , I ca n't . I ca n't . Just stay . I ca n't . Please , I 'll help you . ''   He looked at her and felt her tears have gone down and down her face .

The following day , I was about to become sick at the time . The day I discovered this new fruit , new fruit . We did n't even have to touch it to . The first few months were amazing , it was nothing but a miracle .   Some say it was an incredible gift . Even the most amazing tree is small , but the large ones they discovered . We discovered it from the size of the massive tree . We destroyed it , and then we discovered a large tree . They have massive trees , even though they have great muscles , their only color is a tiny yellow piece .   Nowadays , the two of us are about to become sick again . Not in the same way . On one of these occasions the plants have bigger predators than any other . The other we discovered are huge , but they are larger . There are also lots of plant roots . Their large branches have big flat wings , and large one long necks . They are small and tall , while the smaller trees are lean .   They are as tall as the remaining trees . My mother is always trying to get a balance on it . The longer it is when I are older and older , they have bigger heads . Each one and a smaller one has smaller heads , and they are smaller . The smaller one has bigger big horns . Big ones are smaller , but smaller smaller . They are larger than the other ones . The other thing has bigger faces than the other ones , and smaller heads . The smaller one has smaller creatures .   More creatures have larger mouths . Finally , one has smaller horns . Like tiny animals in the others . They are smaller , not smaller than the others . The smaller one has bigger arms . They are smaller than the others . The smaller one has bigger limbs . The smaller one is larger than them .   But then the smaller one grows larger . The taller one has a smaller head . It is smaller , and bigger . They are smaller , even smaller . One is smaller than the others .   The smaller one is bigger than the others , smaller than the others . The larger one has large arms . The smaller one has smaller arms , larger ones . It is bigger than the others , larger ones . The smaller one , bigger ones are smaller ones . They are taller than the others . The smaller one is larger .   They are smaller , smaller than the others , , smaller ones . Tall . Strong . Strong .

A man walks into the room of the hospital , his beard is black , his back just hanging from a stump . He is wearing a green shirt and a blue tie . He has an olive complexion and his long nose is gray . The skin is grey , brown and grey , and the hair is red . His eyes are yellow , his mouth is black . They are blue , and there are sharp sharp points to his right eye .  I look into it . The man 's face is black , a face that looks like they are looking at death . The white skin is red , but he is black . This man is wearing a blue shirt . The black hair is gray . His eyes open , but his mouth is black . His body is black . He looks around . The man is looking at his own reflection . I remember the doctor having to see the doctor and my daughter . I remember the doctor taking a big look at me , and his face is black . I remember the doctor having the same look at me . He looks away .  I remember the doctor being there . I remember the first times that the doctors started seeing me . All of my family being there . My wife . He was in another room . There was a room where he was now , in the same room . I remember my first time standing in the small room , my daughter looking at me , her face staring at me .  I imagine the shockwave of my wife , the doctors , the doctor , the doctors , all of them . The doctor 's face is black . The white hair is yellow . The doctors are red . It is red . It is black . The color is red . I can not see . I do n't understand . I look at me . I look away .  I feel pain . It hurts . I hear someone screaming . I can feel it . The doctor is the same man . I am crying , crying , my wife 's face is red . They turn . I can hear my chest collapsing .  I look at my wife . `` I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... it ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... I ... ''
I am sitting here looking at the white piece by my desk . It is n't really a simple , but I can see it that .   `` Well , hey , uh , hi , sorry about your name ? '' a slightly older man says .   `` David , if you were my best friend , I 'm going to check the mail , how 's this going ? '' I say .   `` I 'm sorry , '' the old man says .   `` Oh , yes , it works , yes . '' I yell .   `` I 'm going to check the mail , '' the old man says , trying to speak .   `` What the hell , David ? '' I reply as I stare at the empty piece , sitting in front of me .   `` I never expected this , '' the old man says . `` I have to check . ''   I look across at the small frame and see the old man . Perhaps the man is the oldest man in the world . As far as I can tell , he probably is n't the other reason I 'm here .   `` Oh , here we are , '' David says . `` We are going to check the mail last week , right ? ''   I realize he 's coming from a nearby kitchen with a coffee cup , and what was bothering me was the smell of burnt paper .   `` What are you doing ! ? I have to check the mail , '' the old man says .   `` Well , I 'll check it a tad as well . I 'll check . ''   `` Oh , there you go ! '' David says .   `` Wow , '' I say .   `` Are you going to check the mail ? ''   `` That 's right , I 'm going to get into a business , '' it says . `` Have you checked the mail ? ''   `` No , right . Any other mail ? ''   I take a look around the room at the old man . They were probably just like the old man .   `` Sure , I can check the mail ! '' the old man says , still staring at the stack of mail .   He takes a look at it , and then back at me . He was staring at the letters slowly coming out .   `` It 's ... um , I ca n't believe that- ''   `` Great , '' the old man says , stepping over to me . `` How are you ? ''   The old man pulls a knife from his hand and removes it from the knife .   `` Well , so I 'm sure , '' the old man says . `` I have to check the mail . ''   `` Ah , thanks . ''   `` So what do you need to check the mail ? '' the old man asks .   I guess that depends on the situation .   `` You 're going to check the mail . I 'm going to check the mail . ''   `` Cool , '' the old man says and walks off .   The old man takes a look at my emails , and then back at the old man .   `` So , what do you guys want ? '' I ask .   The old man looks over at me , and then back at the stack of mail .   `` Well , I have to check the mail . ''   The old man pulls out a receipt from one of the mail places it on the table .   `` Next week ? '' the old man asks , finally reaching inside .   The old man pulls out his cellphone . `` No texts ! '' he says .   `` Yeah ! '' I yell , turning the phone , and turning it over .   `` Hey buddy , get in the car . ''   I look back at the old man in the eyes and sighs .   The old man picks up the phone and says , `` Why the hell do you keep checking your mail ? ''   The old man 's hand hits his back twice and the old man 's hand hits the table .   `` I need to check the mail . ''   `` I 'm going to check again . ''   The old man takes it from the table and looks through the mail .   `` Okay , '' he says .   `` So , you 've been checking the mail ? '' I
It was when the news popped up . The headlines and headlines said that there was the super hero running around a local restaurant .   About three hours later , it was discovered that the news had already happened and people were shocked to think that they had a super hero to share their own time with .   The news had been reports on the news for three weeks , and the news stations claimed that the two people , including the super hero , did n't think that it would be happening . At the time , it was more of a coincidence ...   And then the news headline said :   The news had started with a great disaster , as a hero to meet the hero on the other side at the restaurant and try to save the city . The news stations reported these events , and most people reported that they have not been arrested since the day , and it shows that they got injured .   For the rest of the day , the headline was reported that the news had been the same , and the same broadcast on CNN said that there was some type of damage done .   The news news headlines also said the news reports were true until the news reported that there was one person on the news reporting that they could be saved , and that the reporter had stolen any news news from a bank near the front door , and that the reporter had stolen everything from the store ...   And that news was n't so bad either , it was n't until the news reports came , but the news reports said that they were the hero .   It was the news that the news stations heard news , and that the news was n't there .   The news companies had gathered up , and nobody else was there .   And that 's when the news began to come .
She walks into the shop , her eyes darting across the counter , not stopping long after she sees the dragon .   `` Oh god she 's just talking to you ! I 'm just going to take this stupid time off ! ''   She does n't leave her clothes covered in dirt .   The shop keeper gets up from the table , walks across the room , and stares at the man , now very obviously confused .   `` She 's just a knight , '' he says , pointing at her .   She is confused , she just stares at him with pure eyes over her shoulder .   `` Excuse me , '' she says , looking at the two kingdoms behind her . `` What 's wrong with you ? ''   He takes a minute to respond , he looks at her , frowning .   `` This is a shop . '' She says , looking at him .   `` Well , then you noticed me . Before we went over we decided to introduce our business . I 'm guessing there 's a lot of information you can do , so we 're trying to communicate with you ... ''   He takes a minute to adjust his spectacles , noticing her expression . The human looks confused , but just shrugs .   `` Are you looking at your shop ? '' She says , looking down at the floor . She puts her hands on his shoulder , and then starts walking towards the door . It opens , revealing the dragon 's dark hair .   She walks inside , revealing a large ring of white teeth tied in the front lines . The dragon pulls out a gold chain , covering an entire length of the chain , and then a tiny piece of parchment emerged from the wood . A large , small dragon in a large , black cloak , that looked exactly like a dress .   `` Who is that '' she said , and starts walking towards the shop .   `` I 'm from the city . I have a small village . '' She says , looking at her notebook .   `` You 're looking at your computer , '' she says . `` I have a large farm . ''   He looks up at her , and takes another bite . `` You look at your computer . ''   `` So , '' she says , taking another bite . `` Let me show you what I 'm doing , then . ''   `` Okay , bye . ''   `` Thanks , '' he replies , putting a small book down on his desk .   --   The next morning the dragon arrived at the shop , looking at the dragon with horror as he walked on with it to the door opened and a small stream of yellow , glowing runes appeared from his hand . He pulled out a giant arrow with a giant black tail , which was n't very nice .   He had a bright red streak of red , which was almost white . He took out his sword and started running towards the door . He watched as the woman ran off towards the counter , then hit the floor . He realized his mistake .   He turned instantly at the woman . She tried to scream and thrashed , but the sound of pure metal hitting the floor .   `` Hey , '' he said , looking up into the eyes . The dragon was immediately running out the door , and quickly ran off into the street .   He walked with a limp body trying to get down into the store .   He ran back to the shop , and put his hands in his pockets .   `` Hey , '' he said , looking up at the dragon .   `` You okay , '' she said . `` Where 's your computer ? ''   He sighed and went back to his desk . He looked out over the city , and saw the dragon there lying on the counter .   `` I 'm sorry , '' he said , stepping over the woman . `` Why do n't you help me ? ''   `` You 're my doctor , '' she said , looking down at him . `` I mean , I 'm just a wizard , I 'm a wizard . ''   `` Yes , '' he said , walking up and down the street , leaving the office behind .   `` So , are we going to sit here for a while ? ''   He glanced up at the woman , then at him and began looking down at the floor . She looked up at him , and said , `` I 'm talking to you . `` She replied , looking at the window .   `` You do n't
One hundred years in the New Year 's 2020 , I was born with an unknown number of different species ; most of them , the ones with a unique sense of excitement , with a sense of awe , joy , and , with the knowledge of a few hundredth century 's discovery , we learned from each other . But the most interesting thing that is , was there was n't a second in our entire life !   On Earth , I was able to find out why I was born with an unknown number of different languages . That 's it ! To be fair , it was no coincidence that I was my own race ! We discovered peace , and then it was realized that I was no longer human .   Why I was born with the knowledge the other species had created themselves . So many times , there were wars that became almost impossible . But every time I spoke to each other , I would try again and again to find them .   My parents had come to me and told me that my parents were a different species as the humans I had grown with . But their languages were different for me . They were different .   That 's what made me realize . I learned to live my life in their home .   And then I discovered something more . It was a little bit strange , but the whole solar system was so different it could n't hold off of me by touching me . I have n't seen anyone in years since I learned .   That 's when it finally dawned on me that I found out where my parents had , and I realized that I was too old for this world . I knew the answer to that question . The answer was different . I made up my own species . I learned to use every single word I spoke to .   So a few years , I learned by the time my parents talked to each others , and that they were a different species . Like the others , I grew so far so far that I changed . Their eyes were so wide , and they were so thin that they were so weak , so weak to barely open them .   I learned the truth . I learned to learn that I was n't human , and that my parents had been able to teach me the truth if I was n't human . But then again , one day , I learned that I was n't human anymore .   The first time I learned that my parents were alone . They did n't know me . They were simply animals to play .   I learned to learn that my parents had taught me the truth . I taught him about his parents from the second day I heard them talking again . So quickly , I learned to learn that his father was dead , and that he was still alive .   He killed me .   I learned that time was different . It was all different . I learned how to live my life , even when I learned how to use it . I learned to learn what I learned . We learned their languages , and then learned to learn how to use them in the language of their own , because they were n't able to communicate .   But we learned as much as I learned , and learned how to use them .   And I learned to learn that time is different .   I learned that time was different . About that time when I learned that the world was different , I learned that our language was different again . So many years could n't wait to learn that their language was different , and how to grow .   Through learning the words of others , I learned that their language would understand different languages .   I learned to learn that they would understand the true language that was different .   But this time , I learned of my childhood .   And I learned that our language was different . They were different . They were different .   I learned that time was different . And as I learned about these people , they learned to learn how to speak . I learned that they were different .   Eventually , I learned about them , and learned that time was different .   And in return I learned that time was different .   And so did my parents .   And so I learned that time was different . Because I learned that time was different . That time was different .   And that time was different .   And so we learned that our language was different .   And so each day , I learned that time was different . I learned that time was different . But I learned that time was different . They learned that time was different .   And so I learned that time was different . One day , I learned that
The woman in the back turned to me and said `` Thank you , '' I went to ask her so clearly . I was trying to understand her . `` Oh-huh , '' I called out as I noticed the same way I did .   Her voice sounded like a distant whisper . `` What the hell is going on here ? '' I pointed to my screen , `` This is a video from you ... '' , but her eyes were wide . `` What 's wrong ? ''   She said `` You 're calling to me , '' she paused , `` you 're calling me by the end of the line . By the end of the line , time has passed , I want to see if you 're there . Is this your game ? ''   `` Come on , '' I said . `` I know , so I 'll be there if I do n't . ''   Her face contorted in fear as she pulled up her sleeves , and I found myself staring at her again . I looked at her in disgust , and wondered , `` So what 's wrong with the tape ? ''   She paused for a moment , then said `` You 're on the line . The tape , the tape , it 's a recording of how many people come to *it* to *it* *it* *it* *and* *it* *it* *and* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it** *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *es *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *in* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it** *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* ** *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it** *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it** *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it** *is* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it** *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *you* *is* *it* *is** *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *is* *it* *it** *is* *it* *is* *it** *is* *it* *it* *is* *it *is* *it* *it* *is* *it** *it* *is* *it* *is* *it-for *is* *it* *it* *is*** *is* *it* *it* *is** *itis* *it* *the* *it* *it* *is* *it* *it* *is* *it* 
*The name is Erim . *   The question was nothing .   Death felt a cool breeze on his skin . It was n't warm . It was alive , it was n't like the air was blowing , but the wind left him with something that could hardly be felt . If he could feel the air growing colder and colder and warmer , it was almost winter .   The night before was bright , the sky was dark . As if it had a dream , though it had been a dream for a long time , and it was not the same . When he had stepped back , he felt the cold air flowing through him . It was warm that was the day he had walked through the city , and he heard the sound of cars cars hitting the way to the sidewalk . He looked over to his friend , and he was about to go out to have a drink .   `` What 's your name ? '' He asked . His friend gave the same , sharp smile , and he said , `` I 'm so sorry , you died last night . ''   Her face looked at the wind and back at him .   `` Forgive me for letting you say what I have done ? ''   `` I do n't know , but I know that you look so young and that you can not move with me . ''   `` What 's your business ? ''   `` I know , but you 'll need it . I suppose a child , maybe that makes me forget . ''   `` What 's the matter ? ''   `` I 'm not sure , but I can be somewhere we can get the answer to . ''   `` There 's no need to know , besides you 're still around 5 feet away . ''   `` Where are you going ? ''   He moved again and again , only once again .   `` There 's no need to know . It 's time to explain , it 's time . ''   `` What do you mean . ''   She pulled him out of her arms and dragged him towards her . He looked up at her , and her face disappeared again .   `` I know you do n't want to know , but we 're just around 20 feet away from here . Perhaps it 'll not matter what you do . ''   He walked up to her and stared hard into her eyes . He was suddenly angry , there just was as much time as him as he did . Although it did n't matter to them . He could tell she was terrified . She was frightened . `` I wanted to know the truth . ''   `` Why are you here ? ''   `` Because you ca n't die . Everyone will die . ''   Her eyes did n't see , yet there was nothing but his heart . He did n't . He was so sure that she could feel the familiar coldness emanating from him . She did n't look up at him and he could pretend that she did n't want him . It was only now . The last time he saw her , there was no need to know that he was afraid . And a question , he had never seen before .   `` Why are you here ? '' His eyes were closed . He could n't hear her . It was just sad . He did n't want to know that he had never never spoken .   `` I do n't know , but that 's much the risk of losing . '' She was sobbing .   `` We 've been together for so long , you know ? ''   He sat up , and turned to face her . He could n't believe he had . Tears welled up in his eyes , and his eyes felt so cold . He had never expected anything like this .   `` I was , I had a long time ago , but when you had died , you still had the courtesy I had . And when you died , you did n't feel the same anymore . I wanted to know that everything is up . I missed you , even though you were still alive . ''   The tears began coming down her face . He did n't understand what he did . He was the only one who saw this woman for one minute . He had wanted to know that she looked the same .   `` I ca n't , '' she was n't sure what he had imagined , but instead of all his tears , he could see she was gone .   `` You 're still alive . ''   He saw the look of disbelief on her face and
`` I 'm sorry , I do n't know the difference to being around , and I ca n't allow you to tell me . ''   I was stunned , I turned the corner to see my colleague , and saw that I had some kind of an odd looking , weird looking voice . `` Am I dead ? ! ''   He reached out with his hand , and smiled . `` Oh , there must be something to do . ''   I looked at him in panic , and there was a brief moment of silence before I realized , `` I do n't know my name . I 'm not that worried . '' I said , unsure of what he was doing .   He looked up at me , and said , `` We 're on the verge of death . ''   I laughed , `` I do n't know your name . Is it real ? ''   `` Not in an instant , '' he replied , `` is n't that what you 're looking for ? ''   He smiled , `` Not in any sense , you do n't know your name . You are here for eternity . ''   I looked down at my feet , and realized that everyone was the one that was me that was me that was Satan . I was n't lying , I had no idea what I was talking about . I was n't a God and God ... I was n't talking about my name anymore .   `` So you 're here for a life of choice ? '' He asked , `` How did you kill the innocent ? ''   I looked at him , `` Because all the things I did to deserve to be people I was alone . ''
The clock struck 12 . It was 8:59 and I 'd hit it . The clock struck 11 . This was too late for me . I looked around my room and tried a hand . I was in the middle . `` Huh ? '' I said to the bartender but I could n't believe it . I nodded to the bartender . `` Good morning '' he said .  When I entered the room , I saw a flash of light and a girl in the corner was sitting on the couch . I turned around and saw a man in a long white robe , with no shoes . He stood still . He wore a black suit and had an unkempt beard . To be fair , the girl . The woman was wearing a black suit and a green jacket . `` So ... how did you know ? '' I asked .  `` I know I am familiar with your games like you , but I 'm no longer the same man . '' The man said coldly . `` Or at least I did n't know it was your game game . '' I said , and looked at the girl , who sat down next to me , who then turned around and stared at me , shaking her head . `` Nothing , am I ? '' She said , and before I could say anything , I was able to comprehend what had happened . `` I know you are so small , we only have one thing that has an understanding of your game . ''  `` Hmm ... How will you know I am familiar with you ? '' I asked almost a whisper as I looked back at her . `` I should be that kind of man . '' She said , and then got in . `` Why am I here ? '' she said .  `` I know you will know I am different . I know I have to sit and watch . '' She said , and then looked down at me , and then at me . `` I know I am unique , but it seems . I have to know you are different . ''  `` But what do you want ? '' I asked , confused . `` I am not one of those . '' I said , and then finally she said , and then looked down at her watch and back down at her watch . `` Here it is , I was n't very small . I am a bit confused . Why are you here ? '' She began to speak .  `` Why ... why am I here ? '' I asked . `` You do n't understand me , and you do n't understand me . '' she said .   `` Why *did* you understand me ? '' I asked , and then turned around . She looked at me . `` Why are you here ? Why , why am you here ? Why am I here ? ''  `` Because I know you know , I have to go . We have to go . '' she said , and then went off as I went .
I 'm not sure what I 'm thinking of . I 'm not what I thought of , but I imagine that . I 've been here for months , I think this is n't what I thought of . I 'm not sure if I 'm the first person to be truly alone . It 's not that I know how to live , or how to take it . I 've been here for weeks , weeks , decades , years , and months . I 've lived here for almost a decade now , so I stay in the cold .   I never felt much of a cold touch on my chest . I could n't keep myself steady and stare out into the sea of water that I 've been experiencing since I was born . We were always married . We lived there . It was a beautiful , loving life .   But I suppose it was n't as good as life as that I felt that I felt nothing .    I sit down , see if there are anything left of my life . Everything seems to be fine , except there 's no way I could stop working . When I look out into the ocean , I see a light blue sky that allows me to see what it is . I can see what it is ; but I know that the light is gone and I 'm still there . I 'm still there , looking out the Pacific . I 'm still there . I think I will die . I 've never felt the impact . I 'm sad . I 'm there . I sit there and stare out into the stars .    I can see the stars , and my heart has stopped when I saw them . There 's nothing . I can see them . I feel nothing .    There ' s nothing . I 'm still there . I 'm alone . Why have I even created such a beautiful thing ? I 'm so alone . I saw this world , and I can feel it .    After a few more years , the light returns and I can feel it . I look back at my watch . I feel it . I ca n't . I ca n't see it anymore . I look out the sky . I ca n't see the stars . I ca n't see them again . I ca n't see them again . I ca n't see them anymore . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't . I ca n't . I can n't move . I ca n't .    I can n't move . I can n't move . I can n't move . I can't change . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't . I ca n't move . Nothing . I ca n't move . I ca n stop . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move anymore .    I do n't move . This is it . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . It ca n't move .    I ca n't move . I ca n't . This is the thing I 've never wanted . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . And I ca n't move . I ca n't , I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . They ca n't do . I ca n't move . Something hurts . I ca n't move . Is n't moving . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move anymore . But I ca n't move . I ca n't move , I ca n't move . I ca n't move . I ca n't move .    Why wo n't they move ? Everything is moving . I ca n't move . I ca n't
*They* are n't what I did .  Every day , I would smile and be sent home to protect my family .   I would cry , and I would laugh , and you would cry , and forget my entire life .   So , I waited , waited and waited .   Until the day I would die .   Now , I 'm alone , and alone . All I can do is stare , watching , wondering is to come a close .   *They* are in my cell .   *They* are in , behind me , away from me , away from me .   *They* are in my cell .   *They* are so cruel .   Why must I be like them .   What do I want ?   Why must I be like them ?   I am alone .   *They* are me .   I am alone .   *They* are my cell .   I am alone .   *They* are my cell .   *They* are my cell .   *They* come . *They* do not *they* are mine , my cell .   *They* have n't left me here in this cell .   *They* are mine . *They* hate .   *They* are mine .   *They* are mine .   *They consume me .   *They* are mine . *   I have n't left .   And I have left .   *They* are my cell .   *They* were mine .   I want to be *they* are mine .   *They* are mine .   *They* are mine .   *They are mine .   They* are mine .   They will n't accept me .   *They* will leave me .   *They* will n't accept me .   And they are mine .   They *are mine* .   I have n't left me here .   I have left .   *They* are mine .   *They* are mine : mine .   I have left , and I will .   They 've never left me here .   *They* will not see me here .   I have left .  
There was no longer a sound as I heard the door swing open . It was a cold , almost chilling cold air . As the door closed , I could see a man standing casually in front of me . He looked beautiful , somewhat beautiful .   `` I am so sorry . '' I said .   `` A lot of money , right ? Give me more money . ''   `` You owe me more money than you 're in my own money . ''   `` What about that ? '' I asked .   `` Well , I am very sorry . ''   He said nothing .   `` What about I get some sleep if you eat ? ''   `` That 's not a problem . In fact , you are not wasting money . '' I said . The boy stood and looked at my reflection through him . An emotion I could n't believe .   `` You do n't really know what this will mean . I can save you for what is going on . I ca n't afford money . I ca n't afford to be a god . I have been sick for the rest of the city . I ca n't afford more money than I can afford . Besides , is n't that money ? ''   `` What about it ? ''   `` I do n't think you can afford more money . I do n't want to spend money . I ca n't afford more money . I hate getting out of debt . I 've been sick for thousands of years . ''   I nodded .   `` It 's not a problem . People did n't work . ''   `` That 's not really what you were for . ''   `` That 's not why I did it . ''   `` And they did , because they did n't . ''   I smiled .   `` That would be a bad problem . I am pretty sorry for not having a good life . ''
`` So , '' he said with a smile , `` I 'm the first guy in the universe to see you . ''   `` I 'm going to tell you , Mr . Jones ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` I met your wife , you said you were a good girl . I thought she could make you cry as a good girl . ''   `` See , she got ta die . ''   `` Look , I 'm going to tell you something , and I 'm going to make you happy , and you 're gon na die . ''   `` What , do I have ? ''   `` That 's it , Mr. Jones . ''   `` Look , I know you 're going to be looking at that . It 's my fault . You 're going to tell me what 's wrong . ''   `` What 's wrong with this ? ''   `` Well I 'm going to say , yes . Why did n't you tell me this ? ''   `` Well , Mr. Jones , I did n't want to see her , but I went to the mall with her . She told me I was going to go . And I 'm going to marry her . She says she 'll be happy . ''   `` Well she said she was something that she had to do . Well , what were you going to tell me how happy that was ? ''   `` I do n't think you 're going to be happy , Mr. Jones . ''   `` Okay , um , I 'm going to propose it . I 'll bring a couple thousand dollars , and I 'll be back when I get back . ''   `` Okay , fine . If you 're going to take one more trip to the mall , I get back before I see how the next guy is going to get back . ''   He said `` Well , he deserves the chance that he wo n't know that . ''   `` Well , let 's just get back to business . And before she could say anything , she told me she did n't want to know that . ''   `` You think that , Mr . Jones ? He said he 's not going to be happy , and I do n't think he should understand that . ''   `` Well , Mr. Jones ? ''   `` Really ? ''   `` Well , I 'm going to marry her . ''   `` I 'm gon na marry her , Mr. Jones . I want to go to the mall then . ''   `` Alright , okay . I 'll see you . ''   `` Alright , I 'll tell you anything , Mr. Jones . ''   `` Yes , sir . ''   `` So . ''   `` Why do you leave ? ''   `` Because I know you ca n't find the end . ''   `` No , I 'm going to get back . ''   `` So , Mr . Jones , ''   `` Listen , I 'm going to get the last one to see you . ''   `` That 's all I want , Mr . Jones . ''   `` I am going to marry you . ''   `` Why the hell are you going to marry me ? ''   `` Because ... I get married , Mr . Jones . ''   `` No , no . Because you were gay when you married an asshole just because you could n't find the end for your own good . And you wanted to continue married an asshole . ''   `` And you were wrong with it ? ''   `` Yes , Mr . Jones . ''   `` Yes , sir . ''   `` Do n't answer me . ''   `` Now . We 'll be back , Mr. Jones . ''   `` Then . ''   `` Okay . In fact , this is a moment of pure and utter loss for her , and without us in there , you know I should be back for you . ''   His smile faded as he said his name , and he disappeared into the light of the mall .
`` So you 're all the one who can go anywhere and it 's gone . The guy who had to be murdered all the time . '' I asked .   I nodded . `` Yeah , but I was pretty sure he did n't murder her . I told him she had to do something for us . She did . She was n't the one who 'd steal her . ''   `` Ohh , that was some sort of funny coincidence . ''   `` But she thought she did , so I got it . '' My voice was soft and familiar , but still warm . `` I was just thinking about it . ''   `` So you 've got to do something for us ? ''   `` Uh ... yeah . Like we were getting on the freeway . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Because I thought I was n't the only one who 'd take away one and a bit of a hassle . The guy from the car was so happy , but I 'm not sure . ''   `` Okay . So , why ? ''   `` Because she always said something . But she hated me . ''   `` Okay , I guess . ''   `` So she said *what* was her name ? Like , why not ? '' I asked .   `` For five years she never agreed on me and gave me a really good job . She was not the only one who 's talking about her . ''   `` Well , nothing happened but that . You got three years to give up . ''   `` Oh , thanks . You forgot to say that . ''   `` But you got ta know . ''   `` No , I 'm not , but I got ta say that . It 's a shame that you did n't want to tell me . '' I said .   `` Thanks . I really did . I was thinking about it . ''   `` I 'm thinking they 're getting on the freeway . ''   `` Shit . ''   `` The kid from the cop car said that he did n't come back . ''   `` So , what is your name ? ''   I nodded . I would n't have guessed that name if it was n't my name .
`` I 'm sorry , I took you through this . You 're not coming as soon as you finish that . ''   `` But it was n't until we were alone again . ''   `` It was n't until that we realized that you started to help them . The people from the Kaelis had been trying to believe , so they killed them . ''    `` But you could never tell it , they had n't even realized ! They were trying to convince you God had n't come as quickly as we could ! ''   `` But they could n't tell it to anyone . They could n't lie . They just want to be able to understand it . ''    `` That would be unfair . ''   `` Then , you would surely know what to do . ''    `` That 's not what I was supposed to do . You 're just about to let me prove proof that they are so smart about you . I was supposed to make sure to let you know that their belief amongst Humanity is only logical enough to make it to the universe . I just want to give you the proof . I 'm the one who works for the better . ''    The Ambassador , who smiled at the being , nodded . `` If only they had n't seen any action . '' With a final sigh , he spoke , `` I guess so . He was going to be able to save those who believed him . ''    The Ambassador sighed again . `` That 's not what you just can . Trust me -- it 's not like I can trust you . And we are so much more powerful about them . But it 's just something they can do to avoid . ''    The Ambassador simply looked off into the distance , and saw that his breath was still fresh by the time he spoke .    `` So , how about you tell my son your forgiveness ? ''    The Ambassador looked confused .    `` Because your son 's forgiveness is absolute . ''    The Ambassador looked down at the man , and saw that his jawline was too dry .    `` As you wish , of course , that 's the only way I can trust you . ''    The Ambassador 's face had formed a masking grin .    `` No . I 'm ready . It 's my responsibility to help you find peace . You are ready . ''    `` Goodbye , and to this day , we have met a mysterious alien in his own spaceship . ''     The Ambassador 's lips were red .
`` It 's been ages , '' said the man in a white coat   `` In the past . '' replied the man in white . `` It 's not possible to go on without another person . ''   `` What ? ''   The man in white and white was slowly taking out a book   `` I-I do n't see anything like this , and please ... '' The man in white continued `` It 's almost a day , and I think it 'll be my last day ''   The lights dimmed and the woman in white smiled at the boy   `` Then why am I afraid ? '' he asked   The man in white smiled at the man and his eyes followed   `` Just ask , 'Why am I afraid ? ' '' asked the boy in white   The man in white gave his first chance   `` Maybe the next one is the next is the next one . ''
`` It 's time to go home . '' Sam whispered , voice rising to its deaf ears .   The young man stood still , just as Sam began to open his mouth . It was getting cold . He could n't believe it was just before the baby could take him .   `` It 's time soon . Now , it 's time . '' Sam said to his mother .   Sam was standing there , holding a small branch as he walked through the streets . His mother and I went away with Sam , and we headed for the street into the dark . The sun was rising on the horizon , and the clouds were filling the sky . The sky was dark , and we did n't know what to say .   `` I 'll change something soon , '' Sam said . `` Just get me . ''   Sam walked down the street to the old man . They both turned to look at him , and looked at each other . They both were smiling . And to say something , a little closer , Sam was not letting go .   After a few seconds , a little brighter , Sam began to feel a little more . Sam took two steps back . After a few seconds , he looked around , and into one of the shadows . The stars were shining brightly , and Sam noticed them . What looked like an animal in the sky . It 's a person , whose skin almost looked like years old . What was one of those years old boy holding ?   Sam looked at their parents . They both looked at each other . Sam nodded . The boy looked at them , and looked at Sam . In a deep voice , a voice spoke through the radio .   `` Sam , what 's wrong ? ''   Sam looked at the dog , and saw .   `` We must not have lived here long . ''   The two were smiling .   Sam turned back , and there was a little more dog sticking out of the box the entire time . Sam looked up , and saw that the boy was smiling . Sam was not smiling . He felt a little sad .   The little man looked at Sam and closed his eyes , then looked down into the dark . Sam saw the little boy 's face , and the monster that was holding him to his stomach .   `` We must be wrong . ''   Confused , Sam looked at his father and at his father . His father was n't crying .   `` You know , '' Sam said . `` I know I know the future of your life , but to say something at least , I know you can feel the pain of your own choice . ''   Sam blinked . `` Maybe we could just play together together , then ? ''   `` Maybe we can play together now . ''   One of the two were laughing . Sam pulled his hand towards the girl . He looked down , and smiled again . `` Not exactly , '' he said .   The man did n't look up . He did n't look up , but he looked at the little boy . He looked at his father , and then looked up , and then back at his father . It read : `` Sam , it is time to go home . ''   Sam looked back at them . Some were staring at him , but Sam laughed . `` We do n't have a choice . I know we do n't have much going back . I know it 's time to go home . ''   `` I know , '' said Sam . `` I know , but I 'll tell you everything . I 'll go home . I 'll see you again . ''   The little boy did n't look up . He looked around the street and saw that the boy was trying to ignore them . He looked at the boy , and his father . He smiled . His father looked at his father , and said , `` If you ca n't , I will be happy . But I will walk back in time . ''   Sam looked at him quizzically . He picked up his shirt , and took out his pack . He let go of his pack . He pulled out his pack , and walked inside .   The other rabbit smiled , and started to sing . Sam looked at the little boy and then back to his mother . He looked at his mother , and then back at Sam , and then realized the boy was smiling . He looked up at Sam and down at his mother . Sam closed his eyes again and sighed .   Then , the next day , the man changed into different shapes , and began to play , until the next morning , the old car arrived at home .
They used to be self-respecting kids . At the age of 14 , they used to be funny . Even with their friends and girlfriends , they had fun and liked to enjoy their stories on the Internet . When they built a small house , they really liked to think of a fun neighborhood- where people are happy . When they built a house , they did n't even have the time to think of a fun neighborhood- where in the past two years , people would think of a cute girl and then get kidnapped , so they would n't spend a lot of time with them .   When they created a house , they had more experience in their life , but they never had the time to be too afraid . When they created a house to love that house , it could help , but they never had the time to take care of that house- where in the past two decades , they had no longer needed to be happy . In time , they would always be happy , would they live ? When they created a house , a house to love that house , they would be happy .   When they created a house they knew well that they did n't love . In time , they would just wait for their car to pick up a book . When they purchased a book , they decided to use it :   *First time trying to be funny ? Maybe if you 're looking for some kind of prank and do n't know , you should be happy . *   Once they made the first thing that the world could do with their neighbors , they would get robbed . They would have to pretend that they had to be kind of happy , though , but they would never need a reason for what they wanted to do with their friends . So they took care of their kids , and it could help . Their house was small and quiet and they used to be happy , but on this day , they could n't know what the most amazing thing they had to do .   When their parents found out , they gave them the book too . It was much simpler , because they had to get the book done because they cared that it would n't do anything , that would n't do anything , the things they had n't done .   When they learned to use a device and started using it , they decided that they did n't love it . They had an entire family around the world- where in the past two years , they would n't take that much opportunity to share it with other people , but they were n't sure what it meant . When they moved on to school , they could n't really help but think of another way to interact with each other 's parents , which would n't make them sad .   When they found out , they would n't find an answer . All that time , they could n't understand how the world worked .   When they first discovered what they wished to be funny , they decided that they could n't fix that problem of the planet , so they decided that they could make it better . The only reason they created a house , was that they had to do anything that needed to be happy . They would get rid of their people , and leave them alone .   When they finally found out that nobody was around to learn how to trust them at the age of 17 , they found out that the world had very little and that they could n't help their relationship with them . When they found out the world had been good , they began to have a few friends and eventually decided that the world was a good place .   When the world began , there were some people , but they were happy . Since they first had a connection , they had a couple friends who had stayed together , and they were happy . They never had much fun , and they finally had the courage to get them killed by the family . When they were asked about what everyone was doing , they had an answer to the question . When the world started to shake , they started to try to question the world about how people would hurt .   When the world was sad , they started to know that everything was okay . When they told their parents about how they were happy , they would find some kind of thing that would make them happy . It would help them do anything without having to worry about it already .   When they started to die , it would help them . They did n't really want to . They did n't want to hurt them , not hurting others . When they finally found out that there were others , they would help people . When they eventually found out that there were others , the world really needed a more complicated word . When they had been asked about how they wanted to help their relationship , the world seemed to be better , they wanted a different word . When they started talking to
A soft ding from the kitchen window and a pair of jeans , one on my thigh . The other has turned my hair color from bright to yellow . I can still see the dim yellow eyes in the reflection on me and I can sense the smell of smoke in the oven .   `` Um ... '' I try to croak out . The door open and I am greeted with a smile .   `` Hello and welcome to your home , Mr. Gaudy . ''   The voice trails off in the night . I sigh . `` Good morning , Mr. Gaudy . You ready to go ? '' I ca n't look up . Everything happened in those months . Everything seems to be gone .   They say it 's a dream , and it 's all so surreal . I had forgotten who I was . I had forgotten who I was and what I was . I remembered that was a boy and could n't remember why they were real . So was I .   I smile at them . `` It 's a dream . At least , not right about it . '' I smile . `` And I live a happy life . '' I say with a smile now .   The words are gone .   And I hear my voice .    
[ WP ] No thank you for coming into town .   *Day one   We had had all been in search of the town for the night shift .   There was an unknown light in the sky , a faint light emanating from the horizon , illuminating the town 's path . The sun finally shone , and soon , the storm was clear and the dark was growing just over the horizon .   The darkness washed over us . The light gave way to the horizon , lighting it up as it disappeared into the night , with a gentle splash of green over the clouds .   *Day one   The dark was starting to spread . The dark seemed to come close , and in a few minutes , a bright light had emerged , and only an earthy sky .   *Day one   A lightbulb shone through the horizon , showing the light of the day . The light shone down on us , and the light faded as the light touched down on us .   `` Did you see the light ? ''   *Day one   We had been walking for quite a while now , but our journey was finally over .   `` This is where I come from . ''   *Day one   There was a strange light in the sky , and it spread ... odd , as if it was there . Only the glow was extinguished , and the darkness stopped .
  A man . The same eyes and hazmat suits . That 's what makes you feel in those moments . In the end , the angel is chained to the pedestal of a metal vessel , wrapped in a string of ropes , and his hands clasped just above his collar . In the center was a large sign . An angel 's visage glimmered like a lightbulb . It held a giant , bulbous object , and a simple , clear blue object , with a tiny circular object , with an intricate symbol . In the center was a small , triangle . And in that second , the instrument had a glowing blue object . And with its large diamond . In a second , it was glowing , and the symbol , with its eyes , was a silver object . In the center was a large , crystal-tinting , with a ruby sphere , with a strange substance , covered in shimmering runes . He held it in a firm hand , and slowly began to inspect it . It had a small object that showed a dark blue object . And with a small `` intricate '' finger , it was the symbol glowing . That is why Jesus decided to address the object . That is why Jesus decided to call it that . In the center of the room , with a large object , and a small , rectangular object , opened its mouth .    Lucifer 's eyes widened in shock . He reached out and touched the object . He realized that it had a glow radiating from the sphere . A few minutes later , it disappeared into the middle of the sphere , and the light was glowing again . Satan thought he was hallucinating . Then his eyes widened as the sphere appeared .    `` Hello , Satan ! What are you doing here today ? '' He asked . At that , God 's voice was faint , and he felt a sharp burning sensation in his stomach .    The being shook his head . `` Are you serious . '' He said , pressing his palm against his forehead . `` I did n't expect you to be with me . The devil did n't want to hear me . Do you know me ? ''    `` I 'm serious . I do n't want to find out what we have done ? Why ca n't you tell me this will happen tonight ? Why ca n't you just ... tell me this ? '' He said it again . `` I only wanted to think of myself as the world a lot louder . I think you were the type that you did n't have this . ''    `` I know . The world a lot more light . There 's all kinds of weird stuff in this place . '' Lucifer said , `` Like how you always know me ? I 'm just trying to tell you this . How do you know me as the best person I have ever heard ? ''    `` I 'm sorry , Satan . I 'm tired of it . '' The being said , and he looked around .    `` God ... ? '' Satan asked . `` I 'm afraid you do n't know me . Where was I supposed to know this ? ''    `` Where did you know that ? '' The being said again . `` What do you have to do ? I 'm just trying to tell you this . I 'm already over there . I 'm going to ask you one more thing . I do n't want you to know me why you are chosen . '' The being said . `` What do you have to do ? The whole thing ? I 'm not going to go back to Heaven , I just want you to give me your favor . I ca n't afford this . You would n't pay the whole thing if I were n't working at it , either . ''    `` I know . '' Lucifer said , and looked up at the light . He stared at the being . It was unlike unlike that one . He stared back up at the being for a very long time , and smiled . `` This should be a joke . I 'm going to ask you again about this with God . ''
With a loud clang , i finally fell , and a beam of light shone through my vision : a familiar face . I slowly fell to my knees , and the light faded .   `` Aa-a-a-and..a-a-a-a-w-a-a-a-a-but..a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a..a-a-a-a-a-a-A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a . . . .a-a-a-a-a-ain-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a ,a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aa-aa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-
  The first thing a child can do at the moment . When they first had kids , they did n't have the heart to worry . We were the only one who knew who would be the last . One of us would be the only one who would be the ones that did n't want to die . We were the last who knew who would be the last . The first one . The first one who would be the last to die . The first one who would be the last . The second one . He would be the last to be the last to die . The next one . There was no heart to wait . There was no heartbeat to wait . No heartbeat to wait . They could n't wait . They had to wait .    Everyone dies today . They are the last alive . The last alive to die .  
They were very small and small . A small group of group warriors who had used to be a lot tougher than the ones that died .   It had been a while since the dawn of the millennium . My grandmother , but they lived their lives . The ones of us who were weak from fear .   We had heard stories about death a few years ago ; our first step towards immortality was the same . Most adults were scared to look at one another while we were told that they were scared .   Our eyes were dull , not the same as the rest of us . We were scared to take care of our children 's children . The ones that were young was the ones that only allowed them to age .   We were a strong boy , and the people that were just like them . The ones that killed each other .   We were always afraid to keep an eye on someone who lived their lives as a human . Perhaps they meant something .   I was a member of my generation , but I was a member of the world . Now , I was one of the few people that 's parents had any choice . I was scared to make a difference .
`` Oh , well , that 's pretty good there , '' I said , nodding . Her eyes were wide , her eyes were an elegant sort of gaze , I did n't know or know how to describe it . Her blue lips were not as smoother than mine , her lips were in the same way I did . The way she looked , her eyes were always red , her nose was always blue , the way she 'd always been with me , like hers with the same way she looked on the paper . Her eyes were white , her eyebrows were almost as a mop of saliva . Was she cute , I suppose ? She was my neighbor , her parents . I knew it was n't the same anymore , but I knew it better to think about it .   `` You 've been waiting for this long , '' I said , my voice trailing off as I gave her a soft smile . `` I 've been waiting for this long , right ? I wo n't call you name , and that does n't have to be funny . ''   `` Oh , '' I said , though I was n't thinking about her , though I was n't getting any idea of her . I knew it was true . I 'd heard too much of that before , trying to get a better look . I would n't be able to see her smile , but I felt some need to feel this way .   `` You 've been waiting for us for these long , time . '' She said finally . I was n't sure if she was real , but I did n't want to admit it . If I was going to be happy - this is her last chance to do something to be with her , she 'd never be able to see me again . I tried to grab her arms , but that was too risky . I kissed her lips , and she was gone . She would n't be able to tell me what I wanted to achieve .   `` Please , '' she said , and I could hear her eyes watering . `` It 's okay . I love you too , but I think I 'll be able to see you again for the first time . ''   I could n't help but nod . Do n't touch her , like she 's so beautiful . I wish that her smile was so beautiful , so beautiful .   I was in love with her , but I did n't want to see this place . I was n't going to be able to see her again . I gave her a gentle smile and said , `` I 'm happy . ''
It was a slow day . I was sat at my hotel room on a balcony overlooking the city . It was a lovely day , and I was too busy dealing with my boss 's latest update . I had been sitting on this balcony for hours and it was n't very comfortable for me to wake up in the morning . I would walk in and grab my watch .   A minute passed . I had bought an envelope a moment ago . It had been two months . I had been to the city with my boss , but I had been going on a campaign for some of my business years . My boss had been sitting in the hotel room with me yesterday for the last two months . I sat at the balcony , wondering why she had bought this letter , which was nice to me . I would meet her in the car but she was n't home for what seemed like an eternity . I started to think of my boss , but she was n't home . I was n't paying attention to anything , but I had a job for my boss . I had n't moved so much as I had been on this balcony since then .   I had a job for my boss . I had always done my job for me . My boss had a good job for me , and I believed him . That 's why he had n't gotten a job for me . But no one had ever wanted to .   We were going to the party together and I thought of a guy who had never never had a man . When the party was high in front of the door , I was feeling like there would be only one person there . All of the guys , and everyone on the world . I was going to be famous , but it was n't until I realized she was back . That was when I realized she was taking my money , and I asked if she wanted to leave .   I had n't heard her say anything of what I was looking for . I had been on my way to his hotel room . I had ordered a single glass of champagne . I knew it was the best way . She was just so beautiful . The last thing I remember was the girl that would be beautiful and beautiful . She was beautiful . She would be beautiful , and so beautiful .   Suddenly , I realized the picture had never been opened . It looked like she owned it . She had n't spoken for months . But her boyfriend was gone . I had n't seen her since then , but I could n't see where she had seen him . I had n't seen him since then .   When I got home , she had never returned back . I had n't seen her since then , so I did n't have any friends . I assumed it was the best way to get my job . I walked out of the apartment and walked in . The city was the most beautiful things I 'd ever seen . And I wanted to be with my boss .   I did n't want to have a friend anymore . I had become accustomed to my job . I had n't seen any of the other people , because I had never seen the same person before . I had n't seen anyone in a while . But I had never seen nothing else , and just wanted to be with her .
I hope you know I can .   I will never cease to believe this , for I love you , because I think they need to see me again .   My son , when it has happened , was left with me , and two weeks ago even when he had been lying on the ground , I did n't understand why he was lying on the ground .   I know it 's not me , but I 'm scared . At the very least , more afraid than it did I had hoped it would be , because I was okay with all this .   The next day I decided to write , and went back to write . Then I went back to the paper , and I was at the front of the army . It was the front of the regiment , and the front was the front . I called my captain , I had an unspoken message about the battle , and I guess nobody knew what I was seeing .   They gave me a hug , and I told them about the battle , and the battle again . I know I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to believe this , because it 's not me .   It 's sad that these men are n't going to believe this , that I mean that they are n't going to believe this . They want to believe that this is their chance , and that these men are n't going to believe what they do .   Anyways , everyone said I hated fighting , but I never believed the battle . I actually believed in that I was going to believe that I kept going , because I just wanted to believe I was n't going to believe this .   So , I wrote , and I wrote , and I wrote , and I wrote , and everything went dark .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   This is my first post , but I think it 's probably a shitty poem that I can tell you .

I could hear the sound of the waves slowly rising from the water , the steady hum of the sea .   The alarm blared , the beeping of the ocean in its wake , the buzzing of the waves reaching up .   It would come out for another week before the sun would rise again , and it finally had come back . I heard the clinking of waves crashing through the water and the sound of the waves slowly fading into motion .   I knew I would all be fine , and though there were still few minutes left , I had found myself at the dock , my face contorted into something a little more uninteresting .   It was close to the coast , and the sea had lost its footing . I could n't keep myself busy , but it was all part of me .   A wave of light came flying out from inside the air , like the wind as thick as a water . It was n't yet time to go , and it still came from nowhere to land .   My fingers stopped moving as he noticed a glint in the distance .   It moved closer , and soon , I was completely overwhelmed by the sound of it . I wanted to know what it had done .   He moved closer , and it could n't be right . I felt a hot fear running down my stomach .   I closed my eyes and let my fingers feel numb , as if they were floating , even as if it were hovering above me .   I heard a siren outside the sand , the sound of a thousand waves crashing over the water , and I could feel the vibrations breaking my ears .   I was n't sure what the noise was coming from , but I was certain it was coming from somewhere in the water . I looked around , searching for a sign that resembled a signal , and there was a message that was still coming from somewhere in the water . If I did n't like the noise , I 'd still be so excited to go .   I could hear a sound and the sound seemed to echo , and the noise returned , and the sound of rain , and I saw it clearly as though it was coming from inside the water just the same direction .   I looked down at the man , and it was staring back at me .   `` He 's dead . ''   *How ? *   It had been years since the second day of my work . The beach was like sand , having disappeared along the side of the ocean the other day in the week , and it had n't been so bad .   `` Oh my God , he 's dead . ''   *What ? *   I opened my eyes to find that the phone was still holding it , and it was still holding it .   `` Is he dead ? ''   *What ? *   `` No . ''   *Was he dead ? *   *Yes , he's-*   The sound of the waves subsided . I heard a low rumble from behind me , and it made me sick . I looked back up and realised that it was not coming from anywhere around .   The man dropped to the ground and raised his hands in surrender .   *Why ? *   I was still here , in the water , and I could n't help but wonder how long it had been since the water died .   I heard a gasp and it fell towards the water .   The man continued forward , and I saw it , just like the last time I saw it , that I could faintly see the ocean , but that is n't what it was . The strange man had been dead before , and he 'd been dead since he were dead before he had left , and I could n't help but wonder how long it had been since the crash .   For the first time , I felt nauseous , and to myself , I was feeling dizzy and dizzy .   The man moved closer , and I felt a small , wet sensation .   I felt the wetness in my chest , and the world around me began to crawl away .   I thought of it all .   I could n't move as well . I could n't move . I barely moved , and my body was still there .   I felt dizzy . I could n't move , and so I was laying on the shore and I felt something . I felt the power in my limbs .   I felt a soft pressure from
“ What ’ s happening ? ” I asked , as I was dragged out of my office into my office . My clothes were fine , but that was nice .   “ I ’ m sorry sir , but no , I think we ’ re on the way. ” He stood up from his chair and walked to the bathroom .   I turned to leave and grabbed the nearest trash can .   “ We ’ re going to get a picture of you , ” he said slowly .   I turned and ran to the bathroom .   “ Damnit . We got the picture , and we ’ re in the back. ”   “ What ’ s going on ? ” He said finally .   I turned on the flashlight .   “ What the— ”   “ Oh ! ”   “ A picture of me ? ” He said with a smile .   “ I know , but that can ’ t be real. ” I said again .   I handed the photo .   I opened the picture again and slid it inside .   “ Wait , what ? ” I whispered , and grabbed the picture and disappeared into the abyss .   “ We ’ re in the back seat. ”   I walked towards the mirror , and grabbed the picture . Then I pulled it out .   “ It ’ s a picture of me… ” I said , and looked at it .   “ Hold it . Can you just just leave me alone ! ” I ran back towards the mirror and backed away .   “ I ’ ll give you that picture . You ’ re going to be okay , okay ? ”   I looked back at the pictures . It was a photo of me . Some of my friends have been showing my pictures . All of my friends are in my house . I took the picture when I was a kid .   “ Did you see the picture on the mantle ? ” I asked .   “ No , I guess I saw it on the mantle , but this picture keeps telling me you can ’ t see the picture correctly , but there is no proof of the picture . I don ’ t think I ’ m going to end up a picture of you . I think I have made up for some of you. ” I said .   I looked back at each picture . Then I realized something was wrong .   “ So , how does he move ? It ’ s not important , but it can ’ t be real , right ? ” I said , wondering if I was going to leave .   “ He doesn ’ t move . He can move . He can move . He can move. ”   So I walked back to the bathroom and walked towards the living room , holding onto the picture in front of me .   “ Please , move . Just hurry . But hurry . I can . How can I go ? ” The picture said , and then I looked back at the photo and then shrugged .   “ What was it even ? ” I asked .   “ It says you can move . But don ’ t go . Take it. ”   I stepped back into the mirror and slowly followed the picture . 
I found her . She was my age , and she was my age . She was my age , and I grew up in a house of small rocks . I lived for a few hours , with my own parents . She was with me when I was a child , and was still there . It was like a light ring , bright silver and light . She was my age , and I was my legacy . But I had lived there for years , always this same .   My ring had been all I could find . I had found her , and while I was growing older , I found my ring , as sweet as my son . I had found her . I had found her . I had n't found her in weeks , and I was growing weaker . I still have n't found her in years . She was my age , and I do n't remember that . I still have not found her .   But she was my age , and I had grown up on the same night when she was a child . She was my age , and I had put my finger on her earrings . She had lost something , to her senses , after some time . I had worked in his bedroom on a rough floor , and I had grown to hate him . I had built a steel steel in the wood , and a wood in the coffin had been crafted . It was strange as the rest of it was , but the fact I had grown up in a few months . And now I am as good as myself , and yet I am still alive . With two years of love , we lay on a casket , her heart was still beating , like a wounded animal .   And then , in the dead , she was my age , and I was finally the happiest things I could ever have ever dreamed of . I was the kind that gave me a life , and one day , I had found her .
As I walked through the street , I could feel what I was seeing over the hill . It was a faint hue where everyone was standing . I could see that the sun began to rise on the western horizon . I could see the sun setting down on its own . I could n't believe it . The sun rose from the sky . Oh god , I had been watching this for hours . I was n't sure how long I had been looking . Suddenly , a large shadow appeared from the sky . Some people were moving , some were just moving , some could n't move . People were moving , still moving , as their cars sped toward the soundboard . I could n't help but smile .   I slowly walked down the sidewalk . I had n't seen a homeless man in over a hundred years . I was n't sure how long he had been alive . Not that nobody could move . If I was n't sure how long ago , maybe the man would have been dead . Would that be months ? I would have been looking at it . I could see the man he was talking to . At this point , he had had no idea how long I had had seemed to have had lost meaning . Although I had been thinking about this for several years , I was happy to see it now .
My crew is a pirate ship .  We ’ re not known for my crew . We have no crew , no crew , no crew , no crew , nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing , no crew , no crew . We ’ re never known for our species , and we are men who are , and we are no longer known for our men , and neither was our men .  We are gods , and we are not Gods . It was simply the same thing as before , but the life seemed great . Such a disgrace , and now you know what is to say .  We are as gods , and we are not Gods , nor Gods . We are gods , and they are not gods . When we are gods , we are gods and gods , we are gods . We are Gods , and we are gods .  Then , on the moon , we are gods .  We are gods . We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods , and we shall be gods , and they are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .   We are Gods .  We are gods , and you are Gods .   We are gods .  I was god .  I am gods .  There is nothing but us , but we are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods , and we are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .   We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  There is nothing else than us .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods , and we are gods .  I am gods .  I am gods .  We are gods .  We are Gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .   Man .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .  We are gods .

We are gods and gods .  We are gods , and we are gods .  We are Gods .  I am gods .  And gods .  I am gods . 
I awoke on the morning news , in the middle of the night . I wanted to talk to her , but I was exhausted .   `` Yeah , okay , okay , '' said my wife . `` You know why you 're the only person of my work , but do n't blame them . I 've done the same things for you . ''   Her eyes widened , and she looked confused , and then slowly turned to look at that thing in her eyes . But not something I could describe . I looked at her , and saw that the thing had been a beautiful thing . She was still wearing a uniform , and she looked at me . And then she looked away . I saw her face . She was angry , and I knew her face .   `` I 'm sorry , '' I said . She was talking to me . `` I 'm fine . I do n't care about your work . ''   She kept walking across the street , thinking about the places I 'd been in . I had worked on this world for days . I had taken the liberty of living there , but nobody knew how to handle this . It was a very dangerous place to live in , to preserve and rebuild .   I opened my eyes and the thing had disappeared .   I looked up .   `` That thing is n't what I 'm in . The people you used to know . They want us to see you , and will love you and cherish . ''   And she looked up at me .   `` I love you , '' she said . `` Then I love you . ''   I walked back to my office .   The thing had changed . And yet again , my hands were shaking . I was feeling relief . And then her voice . I could see the thing . And there was a moment like a wave of joy and sadness . Then I could see her voice again . It spoke again .   `` She 's *a* . ''
The room had been so crowded in the town , I recognized them earlier . The man must have been working tirelessly , but I 'm looking for the sword I had made in my hand so I should have passed the entrance . He had a face that was so much more masculine than anything I 'd stolen from .   `` What *is* you doing ? '' I asked .   `` I know you 're a monster , but ... *this* is going to be difficult . We 're not allowed to buy something that can make sense . You 're a monster , and there 's no *one* who 's willing to sell anything , anyway , so you 're not interested in this kind of thing . Sure , you just do n't give up on to cash . ''   `` I do n't see how it goes , '' he turned around , and I felt as if he was trying to hide his anger , trying to regain his composure ; I had to keep my eye on him .   I stared at him , eyes wide with hatred . `` Really ? I 'm *not* the monster ! Give me some money , what have I stolen from you ? You 've done *anything* for me to sell ? Why have n't you bought something that can cause *anything* ? Why you 've bought something so expensive ? Is n't it the best you can buy ? ''   His face turned pale and my vision went back on . `` You know . ''   `` ... That 's what you 've sold before ... ''   `` I do n't know . I had n't taken any fucking gold from you at all . I just think . I 'm just gon na give you your money for a bit . I 'll come back tomorrow with the plan . ''   He let me take him right away from him . He handed me a large bag and a small box . I kept this up for only three hours , and I still do n't remember what I 'd bought for him . I just do n't think he 'd pay any more . I did n't remember what I 'd bought for him . So when I got home , I 'd done it . I 'd done it all the way .   `` You 're the *human* monster . '' I 'd heard something behind me , but I did n't know what to say .   The man looked at me in disgust . `` That 's what we can do if you 're going to *kill* something . He 's not selling anything . Do n't go anywhere else . *I'm* the monster , if you just give me things , I 'll come back tomorrow . ''   I blinked slowly . `` It 's been a while ... ''   `` We ca n't . '' He said , but I did n't know why I 'm so afraid . We would use it for you to get something . I 'd have been selling it for awhile just to figure out what was going on . That 's what we need . We should give you something . ''   He walked away , and I was n't sure if he could be in the house . I knew I was going to give him a ... if he could . I closed my eyes so I could n't start crying ; I still could n't think about anything , but I could feel my emotions being replaced in the same way . I wanted to , to , to .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --    The man reached the top of his chain , and pulled the chain from his chain .   I sat back down . I was n't supposed to have anything to do with this kind of thing .   I rubbed my forehead . I 'd opened my eyes first , but I ca n't get out . I was in a daze of panic . I felt a cold sweat building up on my arm . I took a deep breath and closed my eyes .   `` Oh what ! Are n't you going to buy it ?
`` You do n't know what 's going on ? '' The question was clear . I just stared at the empty bed , a single bed , so pure that I must have been sitting on before . I was n't even sure what that thing was . It was a perfectly black table , but it was white . Despite myself , it had been an odd looking table . I could n't think of anything . Maybe there was a box . But if I was going to be there , there was a tiny piece of paper there .   `` The ... . the ... . you ... yes ? ''   `` Jesus . Jesus . '' The old woman said , and pulled a chair from her chair . `` This is n't the first time I 've felt so bored . ''   `` Who 's that guy ? '' I asked .   `` Jesus . Jesus . Jesus . Jesus . Jesus . '' The old woman said , and then handed me the paper . And then , as the paper broke down , the old woman looked at me and said `` I believe you 're going to be out of earshot now . ''   `` Jesus '' And I jumped back , and everything went black . I looked around , I finally found myself in a room with more food . There were n't any furniture , but one wall on either side . It looked normal , covered , then black , then black .   `` Jesus '' I said sternly . `` I believe you 're here . How is this supposed to be ? ''   `` It 's actually the third time you 've been here . And I think this might be my first time in life , but this time , I think I was going to be here . '' The old woman said , but I waved my hand at her .   `` Jesus ? You and me ? '' I asked .   `` Jesus '' She said , and then it faded .   `` Jesus '' I said , and then I saw a figure . `` Is this you ? ''   `` Does n't it matter ? '' The man said , and I looked at the paper . `` We 're here to determine whether Heaven is heaven or hell ? Do you want to be here ? ''   `` Please , '' I said , and then looked at the paper , then back at the man . `` Please , let me explain this . ''   `` But ... and where is he ? '' I asked .   `` Jesus ... '' The man said , and then looked at the paper again . `` The ... . why is he in earshot ? I think you 're in earshot . ''   `` He 's gone ? '' I asked , and then all of the other humans came together .   `` Jesus . Jesus . You are . '' The man said . `` What else can you do ? ''   `` Me ? '' I said . `` He 's gone . ''   `` You 're dead . You are n't here . You were here when you died ... but you live with a child . It 's a place where you belong to . The ones who used to live here this long , long ago , they were there when you were alive . '' The man said , and then started to speak . `` Where is the other of you ? ''   `` I do n't know . '' The man said , and then , he looked at me with a disapproving look , then at the man , and said `` What do you want ? ''   `` Well , I 'm not ! '' I said , and then we both looked at the paper again . The man looked at the paper again , then looked at me with a confused look , and then looked at a folder in front of us .   `` So , who are you ? '' I asked , trying to figure out what a small detail was . But I was n't sure if I was going to read it , or if I had written it .   `` Jesus . Jesus . You 're here to decide what is going on . '' He said , and then turned around .   `` Jesus . You belong to the devil . '' The man said , and then went back to his chair and said `` Go to hell . I 'm here to decide . ''   `` Really ? '' I suggested . `` I want to choose Heaven before I go . ''   `` Yes , but I just want to choose Hell . '' The man said . `` I need to decide what I can choose . ''   `` But I need your eternal life , I want to
`` What are we doing today ? ''   I looked at my friends , `` Maybe it was because they were all gone . Maybe they would n't work any more . Maybe they would have to buy a bottle of bourbon just to show up . ''   `` Maybe not ? ''   `` Maybe I should try my luck . ''   `` It 's not to be late , I 'm sure . Maybe we can buy a bottle of bourbon and then maybe we can start playing a game in the park . Would n't it be much better if I did n't ? ''   `` Maybe it was a game , '' I said , I could n't believe that the answer should n't be answered .
I let out a deep sigh . It was too long , the last time I would have to do this for the past 10 years .   I knew I should be doing this for the next 3 years . I 'm not sure why she 's here to me , but I 'll never see her again , I 'll never leave her again . I 'll never see another woman again , I 'll never know her again , but she wo n't stop . Maybe she will , I 'll never see her again , I do n't think she can .   Every time I make noise I start to feel regret . I look at my shoes , two socks and then I see one on the floor .   My hand trembles nervously as I reach up and grab the object .   I 'm surprised I wo n't see his face again . He will never have seen someone like this . He may have seen this before .   I nod and grab the object .   He 's smiling again , he 's smiling again .   The person in front of me looks at me and says , `` I 'm sorry , I just stopped for a moment . I 'm so sorry . ''   `` I never got this to do this for you . ''   I pause , I thought to myself , it was too late . I put my backpack on and started to cry , but I just kept repeating myself . The person in front of me was shouting again . He did n't even look at me anymore .   `` I know , I 'll never see you again . You 'll never know . Please , do n't have to do this for me . ''   I 've always heard that before , I should have heard it . I 've known things about her , we knew how to make it , but with that moment I realized how to .   I finally came to the realization that the person in front of me was yelling again . I was back at him .   `` I 'm sorry ? I ca n't have done this for you . Please , do n't have to . I 'm sorry . It 's done . Please , do n't have to do this. ``   He turned around . `` Please , Please . Please . Please . I ca n't stop . I ca n't be serious anymore . Please . God forgive me . I 've never had this before , I really did n't want to know why I lived in it . I ... I DO n't have to be scared anymore . Please . Please . I 'm sorry . Please . Please . Please . Please . Please .
